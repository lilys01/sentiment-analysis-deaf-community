Most often, they actively avoid personal discussions of dress, believing it makes them seems frivolous or elitist. If they do connect with the fashion world, it is usually as an economic driver of the city or of the garment district: Michael Bloomberg handing Ralph Lauren a key to the city for investing millions in new stores; Bill de Blasio welcoming the industry to Gracie Mansion before fashion week. It\u2019s usually just about business.Not for Eric Adams, the New York City mayor-elect.As he proved when he wore a bright red blazer to a Hamptons fund-raiser in August, or posted a photograph of himself in a new tower with the city\u2019s skyscrapers spread out at his feet, his aviators reflecting the girders and gleam of the building, he is more than willing to use his clothes to stand out.\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6\u2018Ghost Guns\u2019: Firearm Kits Bought Online Fuel Epidemic of ViolenceWritten and narrated by Glenn ThrushImageA Glock-style ghost gun at the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office.

Ten months after rioters attacked the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, and after four years of a president who often spoke in violent terms about his adversaries, right-wing Republicans are talking more openly and frequently about the use of force as justifiable in opposition to those who dislodged him from power.In Washington, where decorum and civility are still given lip service, violent or threatening language still remains uncommon, if not unheard-of, among lawmakers who spend a great deal of time in the same building. But among the most fervent conservatives, who play an outsize role in primary contests and provide the party with its activist energy, the belief that the country is at a crossroads that could require armed confrontation is no longer limited to the fringe.Want to hear more narrated articles from publications like The New York Times?

One of these stories is about a planet called Eyeth, a utopic world where deaf people communicate freely and live without stigma. Rather than the audio-centric societies that dominate Earth, Eyeth centers the eye. In some tellings everyone on the planet is deaf; in others, the society is designed around visual communication and signed language, and everyone signs regardless of hearing status.Back here on Earth, most deaf and hard-of-hearing people know how very far away the dream of an unstigmatized existence really is. In the United States, deaf people experience inequitable access to the justice, health care and education systems, increased incidences of employment discrimination and police violence and higher levels of sexual-based violence than their hearing peers.While some of the discrimination we face comes from a place of ill intent, I\u2019m willing to wager that most of it comes from ignorance and inexperience. According to the 2011 American Community Survey, about 3.6 percent of the United States population is deaf or experiencing severe hearing loss, meaning many average-hearing people have never had a meaningful relationship with a deaf person. Worldwide, the World Health Organization estimates that more than 5 percent of the global population has \u201cdisabling\u201d hearing loss, still a relatively small number. Without that personal connection, deafness remains amorphous, inscrutable, even scary.But what if the population of deaf and hard-of-hearing people were to grow?In March 2021, the World Health Organization released a report predicting that unless measures like increased access to health care and noise protection are enacted, 2.5 billion people worldwide, or one in four people on Earth, will have some degree of hearing loss by 2050. Nearly 700 million of them will experience hearing loss ranging from moderate to profound, a 63 percent increase from today\u2019s numbers.An uptick in global noise pollution and unsafe listening practices, childhood disease resurgences because of vaccine hesitancy or limited international availability, the use of ototoxic antibiotics and a lack of preventive ear and hearing care and hearing care specialists worldwide are some of the main causes of hearing loss cited in the W.H.O.\u2019s report.Reports of hearing loss linked to Covid-19 infection have also been documented, though the data sets are small. Still, one thing is clear: The future of humanity is about to get a lot deafer.No doubt many people learning this news will want to know how to \u201cfix\u201d it \u2014 with a technological or scientific advance, or \u201ccure,\u201d that will stop the coming of this deafer world. And while assistive technologies like hearing aids and cochlear implants are powerful, often transformative forces in the lives of deaf and hard-of-hearing people, they may not be the most effective way to reckon with widespread hearing loss of varying degrees. Rather than a purely curative focus, we should be attempting to eradicate the stigma that surrounds hearing loss.A societywide attitudinal shift like this is certainly ambitious. But we have a sort of blueprint for a successful deaf-hearing integrated society, an Eyeth right here on Earth: a community built in the 18th and 19th centuries on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.In the late 1600s, a deaf carpenter named Jonathan Lambert and his wife, Elizabeth, landed on Martha\u2019s Vineyard as part of a subset of colonists from Massachusetts Bay. Many of them shared ancestry tracing back to Kent, England, and this, combined with the difficulty of the journey from the island to mainland, meant very little genetic diversity was introduced there for nearly a century. The result was a high incidence of hereditary deafness: while roughly 1 in 5,700 Americans at the time was deaf, on the Vineyard it was 1 in 155. A sign language developed on the island. It was known as Chilmark Sign (named after a town on the island), and later called Martha\u2019s Vineyard Sign Language (M.V.S.L.). It was used by both deaf and hearing islanders, allowing for fully integrated work, worship and social interactions. Hearing people sometimes signed without deaf people around, and some islanders reported not being able to remember who was deaf or who was hearing.The deaf population on Martha\u2019s Vineyard peaked in the 1850s, but increased travel ability made it easier for people to come and go, introducing genetic diversity to the island population. Meanwhile, on the mainland, the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut, founded in 1817, drew increasing numbers of deaf students, teachers and community members into its orbit. M.V.S.L. was either absorbed or overtaken by the American Sign Language (ASL) forming at the deaf school, and by 1952, M.V.S.L. was considered extinct.The lesson from Martha\u2019s Vineyard is simple: When society doesn\u2019t make deafness a barrier, it isn\u2019t one. And all this was done with a 0.65 percent deaf population \u2014 imagine the profound changes that an integration of a deaf or hard-of-hearing population as large as 25 percent might make.Today\u2019s world isn\u2019t ready for a deaf future, but it can be. Rather than an approach that\u2019s reactive and narrow \u2014 like CRISPR-editing hereditary deaf people out of the genome, or heaping on retroactive accommodations designed to maintain the status quo \u2014 we can take a proactive, cultural approach that incorporates universal design, dismantles structural barriers and includes deaf people from the ground up.As on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, an inclusive future requires community cooperation. Ideally, this would mean hearing people learning the signed language of their local deaf community (ASL in North America). Unfortunately, the hearing world tends to resist learning to sign.Part of this is because of misinformation that learning to sign will delay speech, and in other cases, it\u2019s the result of a dearth of resources, particularly for working families or in rural areas. Making ASL classes and materials widely available, and integrating ASL into the public education curriculums and early childhood settings would support deaf and hard-of-hearing people and their families.But if teaching the world to sign isn\u2019t feasible, we can still learn from the Vineyard signers by applying their overall mind-set recognizing deaf and hard-of-hearing people as equal citizens who deserve to live alongside hearing ones.Consider, for example, subtitles. Closed captioning is an inexpensive and widely available technology. Since listening and speech-reading is largely dependent on context and atmospheric conditions \u2014 for example, whether there is background noise \u2014 even those of the projected 2.5 billion people experiencing mild degrees of hearing loss are likely to benefit from captioned material. Still, content on many websites, video applications and social media platforms remains uncaptioned. Even theaters often choose to forgo open captions, instead employing retrofitted \u201csolutions\u201d that overcomplicate and underperform.At many movie theaters today, if closed captions are available at all, they are played in reverse across the back wall of the theater, written in little LED dots; deaf viewers are given pieces of plexiglass and must try to capture their reflection in order to access the film. While technically an accommodation that satisfies the requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act, it doesn\u2019t work well, and the device causes the user to literally stick out in a crowd, reinforcing the stigma of deaf people as strange or different.If captions were simply played on the big screen, everyone could enjoy the film together. But, because many hearing people dislike the aesthetic, and have likely never considered that deaf people live in their community and enjoy watching movies, society chooses to prioritize the unadulterated pleasure of certain viewers over accessibility for all.A movie theater is a single, low-stakes example of the many barriers a deaf person faces every day, but it\u2019s indicative of the way a slight tweak of society\u2019s attitude could have a huge impact on the lives of many. Rather than make access all about hearing people\u2019s desire to avoid acknowledging their own discomfort with deafness, society could choose to reckon with the stigma it\u2019s built.You needn\u2019t come all the way to Eyeth; simple interactions with deaf people here on Earth will reveal the truth of deafness as just another way of being human. As deafness is normalized, it will be easy to remember to save us seats at the tables at which you organize your events or draw up building plans for your theaters, so we can offer a fresh perspective on what works best, for all of us.

Allen Gardner, 91, Dies; Taught Sign Language to a Chimp Named Washoe", "date": "2021-10-01T16:37:51+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Washoe was 10 months old when her foster parents began teaching her to talk, and five months later they were already trumpeting her success. Not only had she learned words; she could also string them together, creating expressions like \u201cwater birds\u201d when she saw a pair of swans and \u201copen flower\u201d to gain admittance to a garden.Washoe was a chimpanzee.She had been born in West Africa, probably orphaned when her mother was killed, sold to a dealer, flown to the United States for use of testing by the Air Force and adopted by R. Allen Gardner and his wife, Beatrix. She was raised as if she were a human child. She craved oatmeal with onions and pumpkin pudding.\u201cThe object of our research was to learn how much chimps are like humans,\u201d Professor Gardner told Nevada Today, a University of Nevada publication, in 2007. \u201cTo measure this accurately, chimps would be needed to be raised as human children, and to do that, we needed to share a common language.\u201dWashoe ultimately learned some 200 words, becoming what researchers said was the first nonhuman to communicate using sign language developed for the deaf.Professor Gardner, an ethologist who, with his wife, raised the chimpanzee for nearly five years, died on Aug. 20 at his ranch near Reno, Nev. He was 91.His death was announced by the University of Nevada, Reno, where he had joined the faculty in 1963 and conducted his research until he retired in 2010.When scientific journals reported in 1967 that Washoe (pronounced WA-sho), named after a county in Nevada, had learned to recognize and use multiple gestures and expressions in sign language, the news electrified the world of psychologists and ethologists who study animal behavior.The Gardners, who were childless, raised the young ape on their ranch in her early years.Her ability to form simple phrases \u2014 like gesturing \u201cMe, Washoe\u201d when she looked in a mirror \u2014 was a linguistic feat that Roger Brown, a Harvard psychologist, told The New York Times was akin to \u201cgetting an S.O.S. from outer space.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely frontier-breaking work,\u201d Duane M. Rumbaugh, a scientist emeritus at the Great Ape Trust of Iowa, said in retrospect in 2007.The Gardners\u2019 findings challenged the premise that humans are uniquely equipped to express themselves through language. Their research also expanded educators\u2019 understanding of the ways children learn language, and of how to apply that knowledge to people with learning disabilities.Evidence of the Gardners\u2019 early communication with Washoe was greeted skeptically by some researchers.Herbert S. Terrace, a Columbia University cognitive psychologist, said at the time \u2014 and repeated in a recent email \u2014 that only humans can speak spontaneously and use grammar, two mainstays of language.He said his own analysis had found that \u201cmost of the chimpanzee\u2019s signs were artifacts of unconscious cuing by their teachers\u201d and not spontaneous.Nonetheless, the Gardners were able to replicate their research with four additional infant chimpanzees.And subsequent studies by the couple and by other researchers \u2014 using various methods of communication, like identifying objects through symbols and pressing buttons instead of signing \u2014 demonstrated that while chimps and bonobos lacked sufficient physical control over their tongues, lips and larynx to speak vocally like humans, they were capable of understanding the concept of a word and of learning language, and could chat by using hand signals.Robert Allen Goldberg, known as Allen, was born on Feb. 21, 1930, in Brooklyn. (It is unclear when his surname was changed.) His father was Milton George Goldberg, an industrial engineer and onetime bootlegger. His mother was May (Klein) Goldberg. His younger brother, Herb Gardner, would achieve fame as a playwright.His parents took Allen with them as they drove around delivering illegal liquor, on the assumption that the police would not suspect a couple with a baby.ImageProfessor Gardner in an undated photo.

Underwood.He served in the Army as a research psychologist and taught at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where, at a lecture on love by the psychologist Harry Harlow, he met a fellow teacher, Beatrix (sometimes spelled Beatrice) Tugendhut, known as Trixie.They married in 1961 and moved to the University of Nevada, where she, a psychologist and zoologist herself, became his research collaborator. She died in 1995.No immediate family members survive.Professor Gardner co-founded the Center for Advanced Studies at the University of Nevada in 1984 and was its director from 1990 to 1993.In 1965, he encouraged a psychology student, Roger Fouts, to begin demonstrating, as his doctoral thesis, that Washoe\u2019s capacity to communicate approached the level of young human children.But the Gardners concluded that the only way to correlate the ape\u2019s developmental skills with those of children would be to create a comparable environment, and to treat their simian subjects as if they were foster children.The Gardners published their initial results in the journal Science in 1967 and presented them to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New York.In 1974, Washoe was featured on the PBS science series \u201cNova.\u201d In 1989, the Gardners published the book \u201cTeaching Sign Language to Chimpanzees.\u201d In 1998, three years after his wife died, Professor Gardner published another collaboration, \u201cThe Structure of Learning: From Sign Stimuli to Sign Language.\u201dWashoe lived with the Gardners until she was about 5 years old, then moved to the Chimpanzee and Human Communications Institute of Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Wash.

She was 83. The cause was complications of hip surgery, her wife, Mary Eileen Paul, said.As the daughter of deaf parents who was born deaf herself, Dr. Kannapell grew up in a supportive home environment, with American Sign Language an integral part of her development. A.S.L. is one of more than 300 signed languages in the world, with its own grammar and syntax, and it has given millions of deaf people in the United States a fully accessible language from their earliest days.Although Dr. Kannapell was comfortable with A.S.L., her hearing paternal grandmother insisted she attend a so-called oral school, in which children are not allowed to sign and are forced to try to speak.Throughout her early schooling, Dr. Kannapell felt the sting of what is now known as audism \u2014 rejection of people who are deaf. At one school, she wrote in a 2011 open letter, the principal tried to make her say \u201cUnited States.\u201d When she was unable to do so, the principal slapped her face. At another, students who could speak were rewarded.The oral approach, which emphasizes speech, lip-reading and the use of residual hearing, is still practiced today and has vigorous defenders. But Dr. Kannapell wrote that for her, oralism was destructive and made her feel like a failure. It \u201chas contributed,\u201d she added, \u201cto self-hate and struggles with identity for generations of deaf people.\u201dStill, she always had a strong sense of self, and with encouragement from her family, she forged ahead. Despite her early challenges \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 she was determined to help deaf people shape a positive self-identity and celebrate their achievements.She considered A.S.L. her native language, and it provided the linguistic foundation for her to become proficient in English \u2014 which made her realize, she said, that she was bilingual. She is credited with taking the existing concept of bilingualism and applying it to the deaf experience \u2014 a breakthrough that recognized and elevated the value of A.S.L. and empowered its users.\u201cOnce I learned that A.S.L. is my native language,\u201d she told The Washington Post in 1988, \u201cI developed a strong sense of identity as a deaf person and a more positive self-image.\u201dShe was the first deaf person at Georgetown University to earn a Ph.D. in sociolinguistics (the study of a society\u2019s effect on language), and she became a popular consultant, educator and leader in the deaf world. She conducted workshops on power and oppression and lectured across the United States, Central America, South America and Europe on the bilingual education of deaf people.She was a natural community leader. She was a founder of Deafpride Inc., a nonprofit advocacy organization, in 1972, and served as its president until 1985. The organization, based in Washington, promoted human rights for deaf people and worked with them and their families to provide access to programs, interpreting services and A.S.L. classes. It also sought to bring white and Black deaf families together.As someone who had struggled with sobriety (at her death she had been sober for 50 years), she also helped establish an all-deaf group within Alcoholics Anonymous.ImageDr. Kannapell \u201cwas years, if not decades, ahead of her time in every way,\u201d said Roberta J. Cordano, the president of Gallaudet, the only liberal arts university devoted to deaf people.Credit...Mary Eileen Paul\u201cDr. Barbara Kannapell was years, if not decades, ahead of her time in every way,\u201d Roberta J. Cordano, president of Gallaudet University, the world\u2019s only liberal arts university devoted to deaf people, said in a statement.\u201cAt a time when sign language was significantly doubted, devalued and undermined as important for learning and language development,\u201d Ms. Cordano added, \u201cshe was one of the first to research and posit the importance of American Sign Language for all deaf children and adults.\u201dMs. Cordano noted that Dr. Kannapell \u201cwas also proudly \u2018out\u2019 and a strong advocate for the L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.+ deaf community, and a strong ally and leader in our community for removing barriers for Black deaf people\u201d \u2014 especially in the realms of education and employment, as well as access to services.Barbara Marie Kannapell was born on Sept. 14, 1937, in Louisville, Ky. Her father, Robert Harry Kannapell, went into the printing trade, as did many deaf people, and became a linotype operator for The Louisville Courier-Journal. Her mother, Eleanor (Houston) Kannapell, was a homemaker.Both her parents attended Gallaudet, and Barbara, known as Kanny, followed in their footsteps, earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in deaf education in 1961. She received a master\u2019s degree in educational technology from the Catholic University of America in Washington in 1970. For her dissertation at Georgetown, where she earned her doctoral degree in 1985, she researched the attitudes of 200 Gallaudet students and found that 62 percent of them considered themselves bilingual in A.S.L. and English.After graduating from Gallaudet, she began a four-decade affiliation with the university, starting as a research assistant in 1962. Her last appointment there was as an adjunct professor, from 1987 to 2003. She also taught at the Community College of Baltimore County, where she started as an adjunct in 1997 and retired as an associate professor in 2014.She met Ms. Paul, who was a writer and editor and a consultant on women\u2019s leadership (she is now retired), at a gay bar in Washington in 1971, Ms. Paul said in an interview. The bar had telephones at the tables so people could call other tables. Ms. Paul, who hears, was with a friend who called Dr. Kannapell\u2019s table, but all the people there were deaf and couldn\u2019t hear the phone. So Ms. Paul and her friend went over and introduced themselves in person.\u201cI ran to the library the next day and looked up everything I could find about deaf people,\u201d Ms. Paul said. She then met Dr. Kannapell for lunch, where they communicated in writing.Their relationship blossomed. When same-sex marriage was still illegal, they held a commitment ceremony; they married in the District of Columbia in 2013. Ms. Paul is Dr. Kannapell\u2019s only immediate survivor.Among Dr. Kannapell\u2019s many interests, she had a fascination with the experiences of deaf Americans during World War II. Over the decades, she amassed a rich store of data, including interviews with deaf people who had worked in wartime factories and material she received from deaf people and their descendants. She published an early summation of her research, \u201cForgotten Americans: Deaf War Plant Workers in World War II,\u201d in the magazine of the National Association of the Deaf in 2002.Ms. Paul and various colleagues are planning to finish her project and publish it in the near future."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/learning/lesson-of-the-day-black-deaf-and-extremely-online.html", "headline": "Lesson of the Day: \u2018Black, Deaf and Extremely Online\u2019", "date": "2021-01-29T09:00:06+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Students in U.S. high schools can get free digital access to The New York Times until Sept. 1, 2021.Lesson OverviewFeatured Article: \u201cBlack, Deaf and Extremely Online\u201d by Allyson Waller\u201cOn TikTok and in virtual hangouts, a younger generation is sharing the origins and nuances of Black American Sign Language, a rich variation of ASL that scholars say has been overlooked for too long,\u201d Allyson Waller writes.In this lesson, you will learn about the history of Black American Sign Language, or BASL, and how it has evolved over time. Then, you will examine representation of Black ASL in the media, from TV and movies to TikTok videos.Warm UpDo a quick write or turn and talk to a partner about the role that language plays in your daily life: Do you speak the same language at home and at school? Do you notice differences in the way you speak \u2014 such as your inflections or word choices \u2014 based on whom you are talking to or where you are? In what ways does the language you use connect you to your community, culture and history?Then, watch this two-minute video below with Nakia Smith, the creator of popular TikTok videos that celebrate Black ASL.After watching, write down:Three things you learned about Black ASL.Two questions you have.One connection you can make between the role of language in your life that you discussed above and the role of Black ASL in Ms. Smith\u2019s life.Questions for Writing and DiscussionRead the article and then answer the following questions:1. In what ways does Black American Sign Language differ from American Sign Language? Name at least three differences. How did these differences come about?2. What is \u201ccode-switching\u201d? How have Black deaf people used this practice to navigate predominantly white spaces?3. What role did segregation and racism play in the development of Black ASL? Historically, how have ableism (discrimination based on ability) and racism intersected in some of the experiences of Black deaf people?4.

Do you frequently \u201csee yourself\u201d in the media you consume? Or is your particular identity not included in most of the things you watch?In \u201cAs More Deaf People Are Seen on TV, Others Want to Be Heard,\u201d Ilaria Parogni writes:While filming the reality series \u201cDeaf U,\u201d Rodney Burford wasn\u2019t too focused on any effect he and his cochlear implants would have on viewers. \u201cIn my own mind I was like, \u2018Yo, I\u2019m really on Netflix,\u2019\u201d said the 22-year-old cast member of the show, which zooms in on a group of students at Gallaudet University, the nation\u2019s only liberal arts university devoted to deaf people.Things changed after the show debuted last fall. Parents of cochlear-implant users started reaching out to say how seeing Burford on the screen had made an impact on their children. \u201cSo I would say, no question, I\u2019m proud,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI am very proud.\u201dMany deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals have welcomed the increase in visibility that deafness and hearing loss have enjoyed on TV lately. The current season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d on ABC, features Abigail Heringer, who is believed to be the first deaf contestant and cochlear-implant wearer on the show; the actress Angel Theory, who is hard of hearing, currently stars on \u201cKinderf\u00e4nger\u201d on Facebook Watch and plays Kelly, a character with hearing loss, on AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d; and Disney+ has announced that a Hawkeye series in development would feature a deaf Native American actress, Alaqua Cox, as Echo, a deaf Native American superhero.Have you watched any TV shows or movies that star deaf actors or tell stories about deaf people? If yes, what was it like to see this kind of representation onscreen? How well do you think deaf people have been represented in the media?What ideas do you have for increasing representation of deaf people in general and deaf Black people in particular in TV shows and movies? How might production companies ensure that they are portraying deaf culture or deaf Black culture accurately?Describe a time when you felt that you saw some part of yourself \u2014 your identity or personal experience \u2014 in a book, TV show or movie. How did it feel to be represented in that way? Did the representation feel fair and accurate? What do you think books, TV shows and movies could do better to represent something unique about who you are?How important do you think representation of different cultures and communities is in the media? How important do you think it is to see deaf people of different backgrounds onscreen?

But research on Black ASL, which differs considerably from American Sign Language, is decades behind, obscuring a major part of the history of sign language.About 11 million Americans consider themselves deaf or hard of hearing, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s 2011 American Community Survey, and Black people make up nearly 8 percent of that population. Carolyn McCaskill, founding director of the Center for Black Deaf Studies at Gallaudet University, a private university in Washington for the deaf and hard of hearing, estimates that about 50 percent of deaf Black people use Black ASL.Now, young Black signers are celebrating the language on social media, exposing millions to the history of a dialect preserved by its users and enriched by their lived experiences.Nuances of Black ASLUsers of Black ASL are often confronted with the assumption that their language is a lesser version of contemporary ASL, but several scholars say that Black ASL is actually more aligned with early American Sign Language, which was influenced by French sign language.Ms. Smith, whose sign name is Charmay, has a simple explanation of how the two languages differ: \u201cThe difference between BASL and ASL is that BASL got seasoning,\u201d she said.Compare ASL with Black ASL and there are notable differences: Black ASL users tend to use more two-handed signs, and they often place signs around the forehead area, rather than lower on the body.\u201cHere you have a Black dialect developed in the most oppressive conditions that somehow, in many respects, wound up to be more standard than the white counterpart,\u201d said Robert Bayley, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Davis.As white deaf schools in the 1870s and 1880s moved toward oralism \u2014 which places less emphasis on signing and more emphasis on teaching deaf students to speak and lip-read \u2014 Black signers better retained the standards of American Sign Language, and some white sign language instructors ended up moving to Black deaf schools.According to Ceil Lucas, a sociolinguist and professor emerita at Gallaudet University, many white deaf schools were indifferent to Black deaf students\u2019 education.\u201cThe attitude was, \u2018We don\u2019t care about Black kids,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t care whether they get oralism or not \u2014 they can do what they want.\u2019 And so these children benefited by having white deaf teachers in the classroom.\u201dSome Black signers also tend to use a larger signing space and emote to a greater degree when signing when compared with white signers. Over time, Black ASL has also incorporated African-American English terms. For example, the Black ASL sign for \u201ctight\u201d meaning \u201ccool,\u201d which comes from Texas, is not the same as the conceptual sign for \u201ctight,\u201d meaning snug or form-fitting. There are also some signs for everyday words like \u201cbathroom,\u201d \u201ctowel\u201d and \u201cchicken\u201d that are completely different in ASL and Black ASL, depending on where a signer lives or grew up.The same way Black hearing people adjust how they speak \u201cto meet the needs\u201d of their white counterparts, Black ASL users employ a similar mechanism depending on their environment, according to Joseph Hill, an associate professor at Rochester Institute of Technology\u2019s National Technical Institute for the Deaf.As one of the first Black students to attend the Alabama School for the Deaf, Dr. McCaskill said code switching allowed her to fit in with white students, while also preserving her Black ASL style.\u201cWe kept our natural way of communicating to the point where many of us code-switched unconsciously,\u201d she said.Ms. Smith said she noticed that others communicated differently from her around middle school, when she attended a school that primarily consisted of hearing students.\u201cI started to sign like other deaf students that don\u2019t have deaf family,\u201d said Ms. Smith, whose family has had deaf relatives in four of the last five generations. \u201cI became good friends with them and signed like how they signed so they could feel comfortable.\u201dRemarking on how her relatives sign \u2014 her grandfather Jake Smith Jr. and her great-grandparents Jake Smith Sr. and Mattie Smith have all been featured on her TikTok \u2014 Ms. Smith notes that they still tend to use signs they learned growing up.Generational differences often emerge when Ms. Smith\u2019s older relatives try to communicate with her friends or when they need help communicating at doctor\u2019s appointments, she said, exemplifying how Black ASL has evolved over generations.Much like any Black experience, Black deaf people\u2019s experiences with Black ASL vary from person to person, and seldom neatly fit into what others expect it to be.A language born of oppressionSimilar to much of Black American history, Black ASL grew out of the immoral seeds of racial segregation.One of the most comprehensive looks into the language comes from the Black ASL Project, a six-year research study started in 2007 that draws on interviews with about 100 subjects across six Southern states, with findings compiled in \u201cThe Hidden Treasure of Black ASL.\u201d (Dr. McCaskill, Dr. Hill, Dr. Bayley and Dr. Lucas are authors.)The project found that segregation in the South played a large role in Black ASL\u2019s development.Schools for Black deaf children in the United States began to emerge after the Civil War, according to the team\u2019s study, with 17 states and the District of Columbia having Black deaf institutions or departments. The first permanent school for the deaf in the United States, which later came to be known as the American School for the Deaf, opened in 1817 in Hartford, Conn. The school enrolled its first Black student in 1825.Separation led to Black deaf schools\u2019 differing immensely from their white counterparts. White schools tended to focus on an oral method of learning and provide an academic-based curriculum, while Black schools emphasized signing and offered vocational training.\u201cThere were no expectations for Black deaf children to be prepared for college or even continue their education,\u201d said Dr. McCaskill, who started to lose her hearing around age 5 and attended the Alabama School for the Negro Deaf and Blind in Talladega, Ala.ImageCarolyn McCaskill attended the Alabama School for the Deaf in Talladega, Ala., from 1968 to 1972.Credit...Collection of Carolyn McCaskillIn 1952, Louise B. Miller, joined by other Washington parents, sued the District of Columbia\u2019s Board of Education for not permitting Black deaf children at the Kendall School, the city\u2019s only school for the deaf.The court ruled in Ms. Miller\u2019s favor under the precedent that states could not provide educational institutions within their state for one race and not the other. Black students were permitted to attend the Kendall School in 1952, with classes becoming fully integrated in 1954 after the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education.Desegregation wasn\u2019t immediate in the South, however, as most schools resisted racial integration until threatened with the loss of federal funding. In Louisiana, the state\u2019s white and Black deaf schools delayed integration until 1978.ImageMs. McCaskill (second row, far right) was\u00a0part of the first integrated class at the Alabama School for the Deaf.Credit...Collection Carolyn McCaskillIn 1968, Dr. McCaskill became a part of the first integrated class at the Alabama School for the Deaf. As a teenager in a newly integrated class, she had a daunting realization: She couldn\u2019t understand her white teachers.\u201cEven though they were signing, I didn\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t understand.\u201dA new generation takes ownershipWith the pandemic forcing many to flock to virtual social spaces, Isidore Niyongabo, president of National Black Deaf Advocates, said he had seen online interaction grow within his organization and across the Black deaf community as a whole.\u201cWe are starting to see an uptick with the recognition of the Black deaf culture within America,\u201d Mr. Niyongabo said, adding that he expected it would \u201ccontinue spreading throughout the world.\u201dVlogs and online discussion panels \u2014 for millions, staples of pandemic life \u2014 have helped foster a more tight-knit community, he said.ImageStudents at Gallaudet University shared words and phrases common to the young Black users of Black A.S.L. in the documentary \u201cSigning Black in America.\u201dCredit...Neal HutchesonIn the last year, the documentary \u201cSigning Black in America\u201d and the Netflix series \u201cDeaf U\u201d introduced the stories of deaf people to wider audiences.Similarly, Ms. Smith\u2019s TikTok videos have captured attention across the internet, including and especially among Black audiences.Ms. Smith said she could see herself working with other Black deaf creators online to lift up the stories of Black deaf people, contributing to the recent explosion of Black ASL content that, among other things, has experts optimistic about the future of Black ASL and its preservation.\u201cHistory is important,\u201d she says in one video. \u201cAm I trying to divide the language between ASL and BASL? No. I just carried the history.\u201dParticularly on social media, younger Black deaf generations have grown more outspoken about Black ASL, proudly claiming it as a part of their culture and their identity, Dr. McCaskill said.\u201cHistorically, so much has been taken away from us, and they\u2019re finally feeling that \u2018this is ours,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018This is mine. I own something.\u2019\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/27/arts/music/beethoven-hearing-loss-deafness.html", "headline": "I Think Beethoven Encoded His Deafness in His Music", "date": "2020-12-27T15:11:24+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Gabriela Lena Frank, a composer and pianist and the founder of the Gabriela Lena Frank Creative Academy of Music, which aims to foster diverse compositional voices and artist-citizens, was born with a neurosensory high-moderate/near-profound hearing loss. In an interview with Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim, she described her creative practice and her exploration of the music of Beethoven, who gradually lost his hearing and by his 40s was almost totally deaf. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.From the time I was a little girl, I have been fascinated with how deafness affected Beethoven. If you look at his piano sonatas, in that first one in F Minor, the hands are very close together and the physical choreographies of the left and right hands are not that dissimilar. As he gets older, the activity of the hands become more dissimilar in his piano work, and farther apart.The progression over the course of the sonatas \u2014 a musical document of his hearing loss in transition \u2014 is not perfectly linear by any stretch of the imagination, but it\u2019s undeniable. By the time of the \u201cWaldstein\u201d Sonata, not only are the hands far apart, but they are doing very different things: that left hand pounding in thick chords against the right hand\u2019s spare little descending line, for instance.Well, I recall from my therapy classes for hearing-impaired children that I was taught to recognize thick from thin. My therapist had me close my eyes and indicate from which direction a rumbly drum was coming, as opposed to a high-pitched whistle. I couldn\u2019t really hear them, but I could certainly feel them and their contrasting energies.I think it\u2019s fascinating, too, that as Beethoven\u2019s hands stretched for lower and higher notes, he demanded pianos with added notes, elongating the pitch range of the keyboard; he asked for physically heavier instruments that resonated with more vibration. More pitch distance and difference, and more vibration and resonance, create a recipe for happiness for a hearing-impaired person, trust me. A more dissonant and thick language, with clashing frequencies, also causes more vibration, so the language does get more physically visceral that way, too.That said, if I don\u2019t wear my hearing aids for a couple of days, my composing ideas start to become more introverted. This can produce music that is more intellectual, more contrapuntal, more internal, more profound, more spiritual, more trippy. And I think these are also hallmarks of Beethoven\u2019s later music, and not just for piano.Yet more from my own experience: When I\u2019m really under a deadline, and need to get new ideas quickly, I don\u2019t usually listen to music, as some composers do. In fact, I do the opposite: I take off my hearing aids and stay in silence for a few days. In the absence of sound, my imagination goes to different places. It\u2019s a bit like being in a dream when unusual and often impossible events come together, the perfect place from which to compose. And when I put in my hearing aids again, I can feel all these wonderful ideas and connections fly away, just as a dream disappears when awakening.ImageThe composer Gabriela Lena Frank in Boonville, Calif. \u201cWhen I\u2019m really under a deadline, and need to get new ideas quickly, I don\u2019t usually listen to music,\u201d she said. \u201cI take off my hearing aids and stay in silence for a few days. In the absence of sound, my imagination goes to different places. It\u2019s a bit like being in a dream.\u201dCredit...Carlos Chavarria for The New York TimesI wonder: Is it an exaggeration to say that composers after Beethoven, the vast majority of them hearing, were forever changed by a deaf aesthetic? And that the modern-day piano wouldn\u2019t be with us if a deaf person hadn\u2019t demanded its existence? This is beyond my expertise, but I\u2019ve also wondered about sign language. Are there certain spatial gestures in the language that appear in the choreographic execution of certain kinds of music? And if so, does this imply yet more levels in which a deaf sensibility infuses the music-making of a hearing world?I often wonder how Beethoven would react to modern-day hearing aids considering his great frustration with the ear trumpets of his day. Personally, I miss the old analogs of my girlhood, for their simplicity. Nowadays it\u2019s an effort not to roll my eyes as a technician fits me with the ubiquitous digital aids that, in addition to all manner of dazzling bionic-lady bells and whistles, default to the type of correction desired by late-deafened people \u2014 namely, high frequencies and spatial reorientation to help with speech recognition. That\u2019s completely understandable as losing the ability to communicate with loved ones is an awful and dispiriting experience.Yet those of us born with hearing loss are often champion lip-readers (as I am) or use sign language. And whether or not we are musical, we join musicians with hearing loss (at any stage) in desiring hearing aids that prioritize beauty of sound, unchanged pitch, unchanged timber and naturalness \u2014 restoring proper weight to middle and low frequencies, and spatialization. We don\u2019t want hearing aids that ply our sound world with obvious artifice, like a supposedly \u201cacoustic\u201d album that\u2019s been overworked by a manic sound engineer.In this vein, I don\u2019t think Beethoven would like how so many modern-day digital hearing aids massage all kinds of processes into what the wearer hears. It helps to have an imaginative and sensitive technician, preferably one with experience with performers and composers. A good fitting is an art so the music can just breathe.At the piano, I usually start practicing without my hearing aids, entering a world of profound silence familiar from my earliest years, when I wasn\u2019t yet fitted. At first, I\u2019m still hearing the music in my head, but after a while, I\u2019m more aware of the choreography, how it feels like a dance in my hands. Focusing on a physical experience that feels good and healthy can counteract bad habits which appear when you are only listening to the sound.For instance, if one plays a large chord of, say, eight notes, the tendency will be to bring out the lowest note and the highest note \u2014 the bass and the melody \u2014 to give them more audibility and importance. Because of the structure of the hands, this means the weakest pinkie fingers are bringing out the most important notes. To help the poor fingers out, the hands may be tempted to angle out, left hand pointing to the bass, right hand to the melody.This is a very unnatural position for your hands to be in, and in fact it mimics the wrist-breaking karate locks taught in dojos, inviting injury. Imagine a series of these chords up and down the keyboard, in such an unnatural position. But because you are chasing a full-bodied sound from this eight-note chord, and not paying attention to its physicality, you start to do dangerous things. With the ability to take the sound out of the equation, I focus on the feel. I solidify a good technique first, and know it. Knowing it, I can hang onto it once I do put my hearing aids back in, and then work on the sound.So, ironically, even though we are talking about a sonic art form, sound can be a distraction. Sound can take your attention away from the many other factors that go into making music. Music, after all, is about so much more than volume. For my own loss, I\u2019m just missing volume. I\u2019m not missing everything else one needs to make or enjoy music. And I even have perfect pitch, so in some ways, I hear better than hearing people.And I think that had to have happened to Beethoven. He learned to create music without sound, however reluctantly. While he increasingly withdrew from society and disliked talking about his disability, he left us a living document of his hearing loss in transition likely starting with music written in his mid to late 20s, when his hearing began to fade. In other words, I think he encoded his deafness in music. And as I say, the progression in his music is not a perfectly linear one, just as his progression through deafness was likely not perfectly linear, but the journey is there.

During any disaster, you\u2019ll usually see a sign-language interpreter next to the government officials. But with this disaster being both nationwide and seemingly endless, so is the presence of sign-language interpreters. I watch as their hands create images that flow directly into my brain, as natural as breathing.I am a deaf person from a multigenerational deaf family. My mother met my father at a leadership convention for deaf youth when they were in high school. Every time my father tells their story, he doesn\u2019t sign when he describes the moment that he first laid eyes on my mother. Instead, he uses his face. His eyes light up and his mouth drops open in an incredulous smile. Without words, we see him falling in love with her all over again.I am their second child. The first word I expressed was when I patted my hand against my leg for dog. I didn\u2019t mouth the spoken word, as I would now, but blew kisses, because that\u2019s what my parents did when calling her.I was imitating something linguistically unique to sign language called \u201cmouth morphemes\u201d \u2014 moving your tongue rapidly to demonstrate distance or swelling your cheeks like balloons to show size. People who aren\u2019t familiar with the language often see these expressions as comical. In fact, it is a sophisticated nuance that only the most fluent users of sign language know to apply. Thanks to that, mouth morphemes are something I find myself having to explain.[Sign up for Love Letter, our weekly email about Modern Love, weddings and relationships.]When I do, I think of Mikey, my friend from high school, who told the best stories. His acute grasp of our language made them mesmerizing. One was about a rocket leaving earth in a huge fireball, the vast green landscape falling away as the rocket entered space, and this chaos reflected on his face, especially his lips. His lips would go pppp-pow-brhoom, as staccato as a firing gun, followed by a sudden blanket of silence as his face relaxed and his lips pursed into a peaceful smile.During the summer between his junior and senior year, Mikey decided to leave this earth behind, much like his rocket did, exploding our comfortably ensconced bubble with the news of his passing. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if part of his isolation and desperation had been from living alone with parents who had chosen not to learn sign language.Our family is supposed to be an extension of ourselves. We\u2019re meant to see ourselves reflected in our offspring. But nine times out of ten, deaf children like Mikey are born to parents who hear. They fall far enough from the tree to seem like strange fruit. Maybe in order to make this fruit feel more familiar to them, some 80 percent of these parents never learn to sign.Communication is what makes us human. That\u2019s the reason the most severe punishment in prison is to isolate people, to put them in solitary confinement, a separation that is powerful enough to destroy the idea of time. Weeks can feel like years.Now I wonder if Mikey\u2019s situation might mirror what is happening during this time of isolation to so many deaf people, particularly young ones who lack access to language, and as a result, to information. I wonder if to some degree it may be happening to us all.In my case, it has taken this pause in the world for me to see that I may be the strange fruit. For the first time in my life, I am the only deaf person in my family.When I met my future husband in a bar, his first words to me were signed; he asked if I was deaf.\u201cWhy?\u201d I signed back. \u201cAre you?\u201dHe was not, though his parents were. But I had already known, the same way species recognize their own. This became my daughter\u2019s experience, too. Though sign language is the first language of both my husband and daughter, one that invisibly tethers us together, their relationship to it is still different from mine.When I left home last fall for seven weeks for work, my only connection to my daughter was through FaceTime. Without being with her daily, I watched as signing slowly went from being her primary to her secondary language.One night during a precious visit, she and I lay together as I read a book to her using sign language. But this time she said, \u201cMommy, please use your voice. I need to hear it.\u201dHer request almost broke me, but I understood. The characters I play often speak on-screen, and at school my daughter had grown accustomed to books read aloud by teachers and librarians. When it was just the two of us in solitude in the world before she started school, my language was hers. But I had known it wouldn\u2019t last.My daughter\u2019s brain, like most, processes noise into sound, which becomes its primary channel to understanding the world. With brains like mine, noise never becomes sound. It remains largely a static and meaningless cacophony.But in that circumstance, something incredible happens. The brain naturally shifts to using vision as the channel through which it processes information. Spoken language is to the auditory brain what sign language is to the visual one. Even if the visual brain isn\u2019t exposed to signing right away, it still recognizes the simplest of gestures as language.One night several weeks after sheltering at home, my daughter said, \u201cMommy, please tell me my favorite story, the one where you \u2014 \u201d Then she pushed her cheeks in like a fish, pressed her lips together in a smack, and bared her teeth, reminiscent of Mikey\u2019s pppp-pow-brhoom sound.In these small contortions, I recognized the story of \u201cGoldilocks and the Three Bears\u201d that has become our go-to since we returned, during this pandemic, to our solitude. The hand shape and motion of my hands are always the same when describing the three bowls, chairs, beds and bears. The variance in size is represented using my mouth, which is what my daughter was imitating.But deeper than just a mimic, I see that her face has, once again, become her voice.I hadn\u2019t noticed I had stopped speaking these books aloud to her, and she had forgotten she needed to hear them. In this time of quiet, we had unknowingly returned to our quiet roots, climbing down my father\u2019s smile as he fell in love with my mother at first glance. In this pause, maybe we\u2019re allowing ourselves, much like our planet, to revert to our natural state.It took those simple pppp-pow-brhooms of my daughter\u2019s lips for my once cacophonous world to shrink until there was nothing but the warmth flowing through my veins. I was too busy to let the world shrink before all this. Always rushing somewhere, always an email to answer, a text to respond to, an online sale I couldn\u2019t miss. All of it noise, static, unprocessed sound.But now, in this pause that has blanketed the world, my daughter tells me that she can hear the birds. And rooted as I am, I can feel the sigh of relief this has given to the world and to us.I hadn\u2019t known it takes quiet to truly hear.Sometimes that quiet can be tranquil and sometimes, as with Mikey, it can be brutal. I often wonder if seeing his own language on television like this might have been enough to save Mikey then, if it is enough to save other Mikeys now, each an island in an ocean of deprivation. After all, it was Helen Keller who said that while blindness cuts you off from things, deafness cuts you off from people.But from where I stand, I never thought she was right. It\u2019s people who cut you off from people. And more often than not, it\u2019s by choice. Not learning someone\u2019s language is a choice. Not providing sign language interpreters is a choice. If you fail to understand or even recognize the weight of these decisions, that ballast becomes the difference between solitude and isolation, which is sometimes the choice between life and death.Perhaps in this quiet, we have all become the same. Before this, whenever my husband was on the phone, his face was brusque, his eyes focused in the distance. Now, like many other people who hear, he is FaceTiming and Zooming people as I always have, and there\u2019s a new kindness in his eyes. Perhaps, divorced from faces, our voices are more likely to be reduced to noise.So we get on the screen to see the faces of our loved ones, to be able to see ourselves again, mirrored in someone else. To understand and be understood. To communicate in the purest way possible, as natural as breathing.Shoshannah Stern, an actor and co-creator of \u201cThis Close\u201d on Sundance TV (the first show written, created and starring deaf people), is working on a memoir about growing up deaf.Modern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.Want more?

He then scribbled on a notebook that he also needed help finding a nearby bus stop.\u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d met a deaf-blind person and he just took my arm and trusted me, a total stranger on a New York street, to direct him,\u201d recalled Mr. Roland, who instinctively used his finger to trace his end of the conversation on the man\u2019s palm, with the man responding on notebook paper.\u201cThere was a gift in every one of those exchanges,\u201d Mr. Roland recalled. \u201cIn that chance encounter, there was an instant connection with someone from a community I knew nothing about.\u201dThis occurred in 2011, but it stayed with Mr. Roland, who late last year released \u201cFeeling Through,\u201d an 18-minute film inspired by that serendipitous meeting.The film is a window into the largely unknown world of deaf-blindness. A late-night encounter on a New York street leads to a spiritual connection between a troubled youth and a deaf-blind man.It is typically screened as part of a presentation called \u201cThe Feeling Through Experience,\u201d which includes a panel discussion and a 24-minute documentary about making the film.Instead of having an actor emulate the leading character\u2019s deaf-blind condition, Mr. Roland was adamant about finding a deaf-blind man for the role, both for the sake of dramatic realism and as a statement about the capabilities of someone with what might seem a debilitating condition.ImageMr. Tarango, left, with Steven Prescod in a scene from \u201cFeeling Through.\u201d Mr. Prescod plays a teenager who helps Mr. Tarango\u2019s character get to a bus stop.Credit...Doug Roland FilmsKnowing of no deaf-blind actors, Mr. Roland wondered about casting the very man he met that night, but all he knew was his nickname, Artz, and he could not locate him.Serendipity struck again and led him to another deaf-blind man \u2014 a kitchen worker from Long Island with no acting experience. The worker, Robert Tarango, 55, is perhaps the first deaf-blind actor in a lead movie role.By accompanying Mr. Roland to numerous screenings and presentations across the country, Mr. Tarango has also become something of a spokesman for the deaf-blind community, dedicated to educating the public.Moviegoers may be familiar with \u201cThe Miracle Worker\u201d \u2014 the 1961 film about Anne Sullivan, the blind tutor to Helen Keller \u2014 but remain largely unaware about coping with deaf-blindness.\u201cThe only deaf-blind person most people have heard of is Helen Keller,\u201d said Sue Ruzenski, executive director of the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults, on Long Island. \u201cDoug\u2019s film is groundbreaking in bringing to the fore in the mainstream media someone who is deaf-blind.\u201dFor help making the film, Mr. Roland turned to the center, which works to increase awareness and break stereotypes about deaf-blind people being helpless or leading cloistered lives. It provides training in skills such as personal care, cooking and using a Braille device to operate a smartphone or computer, and helps to integrate people into mainstream jobs.Image\u201cMaybe I could transition to become an actor,\u201d Mr. Tarango said.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York Times\u201cNo one had ever approached us about making a film starring a deaf-blind actor, and I have to say I was skeptical,\u201d Ms. Ruzenski said.Mr. Roland said that the story line follows two seemingly very different strangers who, despite obvious communication obstacles, bond and help each other, and that its message was \u201cour capacity to connect transcends our differences.\u201dThe center began searching for deaf-blind men across the country whom Mr. Roland could audition. It also provided interpreters fluent in tactile sign language, a form often used by deaf-blind people that allows them to communicate by feeling the hands of the person they are signing with.After interviewing more than a dozen people, Mr. Roland had not found the right fit. Finally, an employee at the center finally said, \u201cHow about Robert?\u201dIt was not an obvious suggestion. For 20 years, Mr. Tarango\u2019s life had remained focused on his job in the center\u2019s kitchen and on negotiating his often long, complicated commute on public transit.But those closest to him knew his effusive and charismatic personality. So on a lark, they brought him in from the kitchen \u2014 still in his apron, his hands wet and his face puzzled.\u201cHe thought maybe he was in trouble,\u201d recalled Mr. Roland, who through an interpreter told Mr. Tarango about the film project, which would require several days of shooting.When Mr. Tarango, ever the dedicated worker, countered that it might interrupt his weekday kitchen shifts, staff members told him they would gladly excuse him from work.ImageFor 20 years, Mr. Tarango\u2019s life had remained focused on his job in a kitchen and on his complicated commute on public transit.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York Times\u201cHe said, \u2018In that case, let\u2019s take a month to shoot it, or a year,\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Roland, who immediately saw that Mr. Tarango shared Artz\u2019 brand of humor and charisma.Landing the role was a twist for Mr. Tarango \u2014 who rather than speaking, communicates almost exclusively by sign language. His daily life had been anchored by his job washing dishes, serving food and stocking shelves. But now, here was an offer that was the fulfillment of a childhood dream.Growing up deaf but sighted in Arizona, Mr. Tarango idolized old-school leading men like John Wayne, Henry Fonda and Burt Lancaster and longed to be a film actor himself \u2014 a hope that dimmed when he began losing his sight in his 20s because of Usher syndrome, a rare genetic disorder.\u201cSuddenly, I was being asked to star in a movie,\u201d he said with the help of a translator.Relying on translators while shooting the film in New York City a year ago, Mr. Tarango developed a bond with his co-star Steven Prescod, who plays Tereek, the troubled teen who helps Mr. Tarango\u2019s deaf-blind character, Artie, to the bus stop.\u201cWhen I met him and realized there were people out there who were blind and deaf, I was like, \u2018How does that even work?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Prescod, 27, who learned that Mr. Tarango, like many deaf-blind people, gets assistance from trained guides and use alternate ways of adapting and communicating.\u201cHe helped me as an actor and definitely inspired me as I acted alongside him,\u201d Mr. Prescod added.Growing up in Brooklyn, Mr. Prescod was arrested at 16 on armed robbery and assault charges, and pleaded guilty to a deal that spared him a lengthy prison sentence in lieu of a rehabilitative theater program.The program, he said, helped him create an autobiographical, one-man show that was viewed in Manhattan in 2014 by Prince William, who gave Mr. Prescod his contact information and an offer to help get the show produced in London.At a recent screening of the film in Manhattan, Mr. Tarango was cheered heartily as he joined Mr. Roland and Mr. Prescod in a panel discussion.ImageMr. Tarango navigates public transit mostly by memory and the use of a cane, even while strolling along narrow train platforms.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesAlso enjoying the spotlight was Artz \u2014 Artemio Tavares, 39, of the Bronx \u2014 whom Mr. Roland finally located only after casting Mr. Tarango.Mr. Tavares remembered their 2011 meeting clearly, but it was merely one of his constant encounters with strangers he approaches for assistance as he navigates the city alone by public transit, to shop, socialize and take classes.The charismatic Mr. Tavares communicates with his own New York accent, gesturing boldly with the confidence of a rapper, and relies upon a friend or guide who knows sign language to experience such places like the Museum of Modern Art or Lincoln Center.Mr. Tavares wears a button announcing that he is deaf and blind and keeps placards handy asking for help finding various bus and subway stops. He can sense an arriving subway train by the breeze it creates in the station, and once aboard, he can feel the train stopping at each station and count the stops until his destination.Mr. Tarango also navigates public transit mostly by memory and the use of his cane, even while strolling along narrow train platforms.Mr. Tarango lives independently with a deaf roommate. When he cannot get a ride with a co-worker, he has a commute that can take up to three hours each way and requires a cab, two buses, a train and a shuttle bus.On a trip home one recent weekday, after taking a cab, two buses and the Long Island Railroad, he approached a taxi stand, scribbled his address on a piece of paper, and handed it to a cabdriver.He has several trips lined up to appear at screenings across the country with Mr. Roland, who is raising money to expand the film a full-length feature.\u201cMaybe I could transition to become an actor,\u201d Mr. Tarango said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in a kitchen for so many years, so I pray I can get picked for another role.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/t-magazine/gideon-glick.html", "headline": "The Queer, Half-Deaf Actor Redefining the Idea of a Leading Man", "date": "2020-01-31T16:07:33+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\u201cHe\u2019s a strange little man.\u201d That\u2019s how the New York actor Gideon Glick describes Seymour Krelborn, the menschy, dorky, ultimately murderous antihero of the cult classic musical \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors,\u201d whom Glick, 31, is currently playing through March in an Off Broadway revival that runs at the Westside Theater. The production opened in October with the actor Jonathan Groff in the role, but Glick, who was at the time starring as Dill Harris in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s Broadway adaptation of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d filled in for two weeks in November when Groff had a conflict. At the end of that temporary stint \u2014 during which Glick\u2019s deep skills as one of New York\u2019s best contemporary character actors (namely, his ability to channel his own inherent strangeness, his high voice often cracking, his knees seemingly quaking) were on full, glorious display\u00a0\u2014 the director, Michael Mayer, asked if he wanted to take over the role after Groff finished his contract.The only downside was that Glick had just one day off after his \u201cMockingbird\u201d gig ended, and would have to practice puppeteering Audrey II, his human-eating horticultural \u201cLittle Shop\u201d co-star that he operates at certain points in the show, during the final days in his Broadway dressing room. (For those unfamiliar, the musical is about a lowly botanist, Seymour, who becomes a local phenomenon after an exotic plant, seemingly from outer space, suddenly enters his life and continues to grow, thanks to its diet of blood proffered by its conflicted caretaker.) Still, Glick could hardly refuse the part, he says while nibbling on a croissant at PlantShed, a suitably on-the-nose cafe and flower shop near his apartment on the Upper West Side. \u201cI had wanted to do \u2018Little Shop\u2019 my whole life \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a musical about a man-eating plant! It\u2019s outrageous and it shouldn\u2019t work and yet it completely does.\u201dImageOne of several puppets used to portray Audrey II, the human-eating plant that co-stars with Glick in the show.Credit...Nicholas CalcottIt\u2019s hard not to read Glick\u2019s own life story into this statement. He was born, in the suburbs outside Philadelphia, without a right ear \u2014 he has microtia and atresia, meaning he\u2019s missing both an outer and inner ear. In first grade, the external parts were constructed from some of his rib cartilage; later on, he received an artificial ear canal and eardrum, but he\u2019s still half-deaf, lacking the intrinsic stereo sound that one might falsely presume is a prerequisite for a leading role in a major musical. Over the last decade, Glick, who is gay, has established his own kind of endearing-but-awkward type by playing gawky, often gay characters in straight plays such as Stephen Karam\u2019s \u201cSpeech & Debate\u201d (2008), Samuel H. Hunter\u2019s \u201cThe Few\u201d (2014) and Joshua Harmon\u2019s \u201cSignificant Other\u201d (2015). He grew up doing musicals in Philadelphia, though he\u2019s rarely auditioned for them since his breakout as a member of the original cast of \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d (2006), which was also directed by Mayer. But Glick had never starred in a New York musical \u2014 and didn\u2019t necessarily intend to: \u201cI was nervous that the anxiety and stress of it would maybe make it not worth it, but \u2018Little Shop\u2019 was the test of whether I could do it again,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a nervous person. I\u2019m a nervous singer. And then the hearing element makes it just a lot more daunting.\u201dIt\u2019s kismet, then, or perhaps just plain good casting, that Seymour is one of theater\u2019s most enduring representations of that sort of manic energy. Though the musical has been remounted with varying degrees of success over the years (Seymour often played by an incongruous hunk, notably Jake Gyllenhaal), Mayer\u2019s tightly directed rendition maintains more of the gay-adjacent, camp sensibility \u2014 with its doo-wop chorus, B-movie shading and root-for-the-underdog empathy \u2014 of the original, created in 1982 by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who would go on to write two similarly sly Disney movies: 1989\u2019s \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d and 1991\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201d (That Ashman would die of complications from AIDS in 1991 only makes the play\u2019s blood panic all the more prescient.) Then as now, the \u201cLittle Shop\u201d songs are clever earworms. But in the hands of Christian Borle, who plays the sadistic dentist Orin Scrivello, and Tammy Blanchard, who plays Seymour\u2019s down-on-her-luck love interest, Audrey, they take on a blue, mournful quality, with a dark tinge that Glick also harnesses. \u201cAs an artist, I benefit from the anxiety,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s in the way Seymour speaks \u2014 he\u2019s a meek guy. And then you see him grow in confidence, a confidence rooted in killing people, which is a good psychological study of where we\u2019re at culturally.\u201d Glick reads this two ways: On one hand, thanks in part to the rise of streaming platforms, we\u2019re in the age of cultural reboots (there\u2019s also a movie remake of \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors,\u201d directed by Greg Berlanti, in the works). And while the actor is loathe to oversell the political implications of a musical comedy about a carnivorous plant, he\u2019s not not thinking about it: \u201cThe show\u2019s about making a deal with the devil,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn a way, I feel our country\u2019s made a deal with the devil.\u201dImageGlick and Celia Keenan-Bolger (left) \u2014 with whom he starred in \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d \u2014 on one of the four covers of T\u2019s 2019 Culture issue.Credit...Todd HidoStill, \u201cLittle Shop\u201d is perhaps best known today as a relic, particularly the 1986 movie musical, in which Seymour was played, appropriately, by Rick Moranis (and the ending was changed, inappropriately, to be more uplifting). Yet the play\u2019s innate intimacy and winking, satirical style \u2014 actors literally climb into a giant, cartoon-green, oversize plant puppet when they\u2019re \u201ceaten\u201d \u2014 benefits from its new, smaller stage. It was Ashman who reportedly said that he didn\u2019t want \u201cLittle Shop\u201d to move from its Off Broadway home, the Orpheum in the East Village, where it played for more than 2,000 performances, to a larger, glitzier Broadway venue. It\u2019s easy to see why when sitting in one of the Westside\u2019s 270 seats, the actors mugging in close range, the Skid Row sets intentionally shabby, the fake blood taking on the endearing, barely scary quality of a 1980s science-fiction film. Indeed, the new \u201cLittle Shop\u201d works so well because it conjures an earlier age, those punk days that preceded our current era of polish and perfection, when roughness was built into the culture, when you went to the theater to see what worked \u2014 and also what needed work, fully aware that something could go wrong, and knowing that such spontaneity might resonate, too. Glick, in his own way, embodies that throwback spirit. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of myself as a folk artist, a self-taught artist,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe rough around the edges, but hopefully there\u2019s something in the core that strikes people.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/sports/milwaukee-bucks-sign-language.html", "headline": "Giannis Antetokounmpo Is Called Amazing. Now in Sign Language, Too.", "date": "2019-11-29T23:35:56+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 Mike Budenholzer, the coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, recently described Giannis Antetokounmpo as a \u201cmonster\u201d at one of his postgame news conferences.In that moment, as he stood a few feet from Budenholzer, Brice Christianson tried to work out in his head how to interpret that word for his audience watching live on social media. Christianson, a sign language interpreter, decided that using the word \u201cmonster\u201d would have been too literal, so he signed for the word \u201cexplosive\u201d instead.Afterward, Christianson was second-guessing himself. Sports jargon can be tricky. He even consulted Christopher Rawlings, a friend and colleague who works as a sign language specialist for the state of Wisconsin. Rawlings, who is deaf, asked Christianson whether he had considered using the sign for \u201chot\u201d or \u201con fire.\u201dIt was all about getting to the essence of a simple truth, no matter the language.\u201cThat Giannis is unstoppable,\u201d Christianson said.The Bucks are trying something new after their home games this season: broadcasting Budenholzer\u2019s remarks to the world in English and in American Sign Language. The Bucks, and especially Antetokounmpo, are leading the Eastern Conference and are as good as ever, but now even more of their fans are able to engage with the team and enjoy Budenholzer\u2019s recaps of the Greek Freak\u2019s nightly feats of awesome.\u201cIt\u2019s one of those small things that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Peter Feigin, the team president.Feigin approached Budenholzer before the start of the season to ask if he would be O.K. with having an interpreter standing next to him on the dais. Budenholzer, who comes from the Gregg Popovich school of communications, has never had any illusions that he reveals great insight after games.\u201cI always joke that I\u2019m pretty boring,\u201d Budenholzer said in an interview. \u201cSo I\u2019m probably pretty boring in sign language, too.\u201dImageAs the hearing child of two deaf parents, Christianson grew up in Appleton, Wis., attending sporting events with his father, who would rely on him to act as his interpreter.Credit...Lauren Justice for The New York TimesBut he was glad to agree to it \u2014 no matter how dry his material. Now Budenholzer\u2019s thoughts on Antetokounmpo\u2019s latest exploits and his team\u2019s overall play are being relayed by Christianson, 36, who pitched the idea to the Bucks in September.Those who advocate greater access for people who are deaf or hard of hearing say that by live streaming Budenholzer\u2019s bilingual news conferences on social media, the Bucks and Fox Sports Wisconsin are shining a spotlight on an underserved community while highlighting the importance of meeting their needs.\u201cThe deaf community always mentions that they struggle with closed captioning,\u201d Rawlings said. \u201cBut with American Sign Language, we get full access to our visual language. There\u2019s clarity. It might be a close game, and I cannot wait to see what Brice does.\u201dMore than 500,000 people in Wisconsin are deaf, hard of hearing and/or deaf-blind, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. And while many people who are deaf have strong English literacy skills, Christianson said, some struggle with it as their second language. Children who can hear typically learn to read by listening to how words sound. Those who are deaf often struggle to find educational programs in public schools that can help them learn in different ways. As a result, closed captioning is not always an effective form of communication, especially as captions do not capture emotion, inflection or tone.Interpreters, though, can convey all the nuance that captions miss.\u201cPeople just seem so excited and astonished that we\u2019re even doing this,\u201d Christianson said.As the hearing child of two deaf parents, Christianson grew up in Appleton, Wis., attending sporting events with his father, who would rely on him to act as his interpreter.\u201cI\u2019m always thinking about my parents,\u201d Christianson said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not trying to make it emotional, but it\u2019s always about trying to understand their perspective.\u201dChristianson is also a huge sports fan who loves the Bucks and the N.F.L.\u2019s Green Bay Packers. When he began \u201cThe Unknown Packers Podcast\u201d a couple of years ago, he made sure to help produce a supplementary version in sign language.\u201cThat\u2019s when I started thinking, well, if we can do this with podcasts, which have been systematically and predominantly focused on the hearing population, what else can we do?\u201d Christianson said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about access, and I think it\u2019s a fundamental right of humans to have access.\u201dChristianson had been working as an A.S.L. interpreter for concerts and events at Fiserv Forum, the Bucks\u2019 home arena, when he had lunch before the start of the season with Kieran Nulty, the vice president for arena experience. Christianson asked a question that had been percolating: What did Nulty think of providing an interpreter for Budenholzer\u2019s news conferences?Christianson said he had gotten used to people politely brushing him off whenever he asked about improving access for the hard of hearing. The line he usually gets is, \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d But he could tell that Nulty was intrigued. Sure enough, Nulty went to Feigin, who was so receptive to the idea that he took it to Budenholzer.\u201cYou never know how coaches will react,\u201d Feigin said, \u201cbut he was instantaneous: \u2018Oh, absolutely. Just tell me what you need.\u2019 This was a 30-second no-brainer for everyone involved.\u201dIt made the most sense, Feigin said, to start by having Christianson interpret Budenholzer\u2019s postgame news conferences. They tend to be newsy for fans, no matter how boring Budenholzer thinks he comes across. The logistics are fairly straightforward: Budenholzer sits at the front of the room and fields questions from reporters for about five to 10 minutes.ImageSometimes it is difficult to describe \u2014 in any language \u2014 the talents of the Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo.Credit...Morry Gash/Associated PressThe Bucks did a practice run before their final preseason game to determine where Christianson should stand in relation to Budenholzer (a few feet to his left), what he should wear (a blue team-branded pullover) and how Fox Sports Wisconsin should structure the live stream (a split screen of Budenholzer and Christianson).Still, even though it had been his idea from the start, Christianson had some reservations ahead of the season opener. He had no idea how his presence at the news conference would be received, he said. He did not want it to come off as a gimmick, and he did not want the team\u2019s broader audience to pity the deaf community as a result. It was also one of the most high-profile assignments of his career.\u201cI was a nervous wreck,\u201d Christianson said.Making matters worse, the Bucks lost that game. Christianson wondered whether Budenholzer would be in a bad mood. But the news conference went well. Mike Dimond, the senior vice president and general manager of Fox Sports Wisconsin, was monitoring the live feed from the production truck.\u201cYou could see people joining in to watch as it was happening,\u201d Dimond said. \u201cI think there was a real groundswell within that community.\u201dThe news conferences are averaging more than 7,000 views per game on social media, a team spokesman said. The TV broadcast does not include Christianson\u2019s signing.Following Budenholzer\u2019s news conferences, Christianson finds the video to review his own performance \u2014 over and over.

(A fifth video shows an exaggerated variant of the last sign.)In a letter to the university last week, Rabbi Menachem Margolin, chairman of the European Jewish Association, urged the university to \u201cclarify the situation\u201d and remove the \u201coffensive videos immediately,\u201d after a Flemish Jewish family contacted him and expressed their \u201cdisgust\u201d at coming across three videos when looking up words in sign language for fun.\u201cThe first two appear to be standard sign language,\u201d Rabbi Margolin said of the signs in the letter to the rector, Rik Van de Walle. \u201cIf the aim of this project was to embellish or add to the standard definition, it has certainly managed to so, in the most stereotypical and racist way imaginable, by focusing on side-locks and, worse still, gesticulating a hooked nose to describe a Jew.\u201dBut the university, which has about 44,000 students and is publicly funded by the Flemish government, has declined to take any action. It said that it had discussed the complaints with the researchers who created the dictionary. But in a statement on Friday that was approved by Mr. Van de Walle, the university described the controversy as a purely \u201cscientific issue.\u201dIt said that in creating the dictionary, researchers merely \u201cregister and describe the signs that are used in the Flemish sign language.\u201d It added: \u201cThey don\u2019t take position on these signs, and don\u2019t cast a value judgment on them. This is what lexicographers do.\u201dThe controversy comes amid a wider rise in anti-Semitism across Europe. And Belgium has been criticized for the persistence of blackface imagery as cultural themes and for other tactics seen as punishing religious minorities.One of the most popular festivals for Belgian children is St. Nicholas Day, on Dec. 6, when the saint brings presents for all the good children and the bad ones are punished by his helper, a character called \u201cBlack Pete,\u201d who wears blackface makeup.The same tradition was followed in some parts of France and in the Netherlands, where it has come under intense criticism, often being abandoned or rethought. The practice has lingered in Belgium, a former colonial power in Africa.This year, Belgium banned Muslim and Jewish ways of ritually slaughtering animals, part of a clash across Europe over the balance between animal welfare and religious freedom. Animal rights advocates and right-wing nationalists both pushed for the ban on ritual slaughter, but others said the new restrictions amounted to bigotry under the guise of animal protection.And also this year, Jews condemned a carnival in the city of Aalst, about 20 miles from Ghent, where floats displayed gross caricatures of Orthodox Jews with mice on their shoulders, sitting on bags of money.Responding to the offensive sign language videos, Chief Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt, president of the Conference of European Rabbis, said: \u201cWe no longer live in an era where just because something was historically acceptable, it is still acceptable today.\u2019\u2019\u201cWith the rise of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic stereotypes throughout Europe, as well as the specific challenges the Jewish community is facing regarding limiting religious practice in the Belgian regions of Flanders and Wallonia, racist imagery like the hooked nose only exacerbate prejudices.\u201dThe Flemish Sign Language Center, which helped create the dictionary in 1999 and is responsible for updating its content, said in a statement that the dictionary included signs on a \u201cdescriptive\u201d basis, based on the state of the Flemish sign language \u201cas it is.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t decide ourselves whether or not a sign has its place in the dictionary,\u201d the statement said, adding that because sign languages are visual, they often refer to \u201ccertain stereotypical visual characteristics\u201d of people.The center said that the offensive Flemish signs were \u201cnot new,\u201d but \u201coriginated much earlier\u201d than 1999 and had become offensive only in recent years. Across Europe, the center noted, \u201cBelgium\u201d is often signed by a beer belly gesture, \u201cChina\u201d by tugging the eyes and \u201cAfrica\u201d by referring to skin color.But in many dictionaries of sign languages around the world, including of American Sign Language in the United States, the sign for \u201cJewish\u201d is simply a stroke under the chin.Michael Freilich, a Jewish member of the Belgian federal Parliament for the conservative and separatist New Flemish Alliance party, said that universities should be on the forefront of fighting such symbols of bigotry in society, rather than excusing them.\u201cIt\u2019s more shocking that the university\u2019s rector doesn\u2019t empathize with the Jewish community and doesn\u2019t understand the problem \u2014 that is a bigger issue than that it was published in the first place,\u201d he said.\u201cMistakes happen,\u201d Mr. Freilich added, \u201cbut when you are shown that mistake, you would expect an apology, some movement. But when it comes to Belgium, these sensitivities are just not there.\u201dThe controversy appears to have had some effect, however. The Flemish Sign Language Center said it would soon create a new dictionary that would attach value labels to certain signs. And by Friday, the label \u201cnegative connotation\u201d had appeared under the videos depicting Jews using signs for pipe curls and hooked noses."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/obituaries/harlan-lane-dead.html", "headline": "Harlan Lane, Vigorous Advocate for Deaf Culture, Dies at 82", "date": "2019-07-28T19:53:05+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Harlan Lane, a psychologist whose immersion in the world of deaf people led him to become a leading champion of the position that people born unable to hear are not disabled but are part of a distinct ethnic group with their own vibrant culture, died on July 13 at his home in Roquefort-les-Pins, France, near Nice. He was 82.Dr. Richard Pillard, a friend and collaborator, said the cause had been Parkinson\u2019s disease. Dr. Lane also had a home in Boston.Dr. Lane was a hearing person whose work in psychology and linguistics was transformed in the early 1970s when he was introduced to deaf students communicating in American Sign Language at the University of California, San Diego, where he was a visiting professor.\u201cI became quite excited because I realized there was a whole new way to look at the psychology of language,\u201d he recalled in an article in 2011 about him on the website of Northeastern University in Boston, where he taught for many years until retiring in 2012. \u201cI felt like Balboa discovering the Pacific.\u201dWatching the students communicate led him to deeply explore what he called \u201cDeaf World,\u201d in books, journal articles and research, largely at Northeastern, where he was instrumental in starting an A.S.L. program. He eventually learned to sign.Cathy Cogen, the first director of the A.S.L. program, recalled how determined Dr. Lane had been to start holding classes in which hearing students could learn the visual-gestural language.\u201cBut the college said no,\u201d Ms. Cogen said by phone. \u201cHarlan didn\u2019t take no for an answer, and in his gentle and poised way, he started offering the classes. When students started streaming in, the dean\u2019s office said O.K. and accredited them.\u201dDr. Lane said often that hereditary deaf people constituted an ethnic group, like any other, with their own language, culture, customs, values and humor \u2014 and that they did not define themselves as disabled.\u201cIt\u2019s a positive value, being deaf,\u201d he told The Boston Globe in 2011 after the publication of \u201cPeople of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry,\u201d which he wrote with Dr. Pillard, a former professor of psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine, and Ulf Hedberg, who is deaf and is a former director of Deaf Library Collections and Archives at Gallaudet University in Washington.He added: \u201cWhen a culturally deaf woman is pregnant, she is hoping \u2014 what they say, if I can summarize it briefly, is: \u2018I\u2019ll love the child; it will be my child. But of course if it was deaf that would be really nice.\u2019\u201dDr. Lane, who received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1991, wrote or co-wrote several other books, including \u201cWhen the Mind Hears: A History of the Deaf\u201d (1984), \u201cThe Mask of Benevolence: Disabling the Deaf Community\u201d (1992) and \u201cA Journey into the Deaf World\u201d (1996).In an essay in The New York Review of Books in 1986, the neurologist Oliver Sacks lauded \u201cWhen the Mind Hears\u201d and \u201cThe Deaf Experience\u201d (1984), a book that Dr. Lane had edited, as of \u201csovereign importance.\u201d Dr. Sacks wrote that Dr. Lane had demonstrated that A.S.L. \u201cis as easy (as \u2018natural\u2019) to acquire for the deaf as speech for the hearing, and that signing is by far the best (and often the only) foundation for teaching children a second language (English, French or whatever).\u201dImageDr. Lane, left, and Dr. Richard Pillard.

His parents divorced when he was young, and he was raised by a grandmother.After earning bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in psychology from Columbia University, he studied under the behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner at Harvard, where he received a Ph.D. in psychology. He taught at the University of Michigan and at what is now called Sorbonne University in Paris, where he earned a degree in linguistics.He was hired in 1974 by Northeastern\u2019s psychology department as its chairman (a position he held until 1979) and a professor. He would, in time, help start its A.S.L. program, and establish a research laboratory that studied speech and language.In 1988, while teaching as a visiting professor at Gallaudet, where the students are deaf and hearing-impaired, he watched proudly as students protested the school\u2019s selection of a hearing educator as its new president over qualified deaf candidates.When the students commandeered the school\u2019s gym, Dr. Lane watched as their \u201cflying fingers\u201d conveyed an awakening of their cultural pride. \u201cIn that silence you could feel the kids\u2019 excitement at being on their own and coming together with their own kind,\u201d Dr. Lane told The Chicago Tribune. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of solidarity that, once a minority experiences it, there\u2019s no turning them back.\u201dThe school reversed its decision several days later and hired its first deaf president, I. King Jordan.After Dr. Lane\u2019s death, Roberta J. Cordano, Gallaudet\u2019s current president, who is deaf, said in a statement: \u201cAs a hearing person who advocated for the rights of Deaf people, Harlan Lane had few peers.\u201dDr. Lane vigorously opposed cochlear implants for deaf children as surgically risky and unethical, as well as of dubious value compared with learning A.S.L.\u201cThere is no evidence that early-implanted children will do better at acquiring English than they would with noninvasive aids or with no aids whatever,\u201d a position paper that he co-wrote for the National Association of the Deaf in 1991 said.His demonstrated his antagonism to implants when he spoke in 1996 to a group of parents of deaf children in Norwood, Mass.

Pure and simple.\u201dAlma Bournazian, an academic specialist in Northeastern\u2019s A.S.L. program who started tutoring Dr. Lane in sign language in the 1980s, said that the more that Dr. Lane had socialized among deaf people, the more he had been accepted.\u201cHe had a deaf heart \u2014 the biggest heart,\u201d Ms. Bournazian, who is deaf, said through a service that let her sign by video to an interpreter. \u201cHe spoke up, raised money for the deaf community and supported our rights.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/business/retirement-planning-disabled-deaf-blind.html", "headline": "At Banks and Fund Firms, Access Is Too Often Denied, Blind and Deaf Investors Say", "date": "2019-07-05T11:00:04+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Albert Rizzi gave up on trying to manage his nest egg because as a blind person, he encountered digital barriers constantly. Many of the websites, mobile apps, PDFs and software programs he needed were not accessible. Sometimes, they just didn\u2019t work.So Mr. Rizzi, 55, the founder of My Blind Spot, an accessibility advocacy group in New York, filed a federal lawsuit in April 2018 against Morgan Stanley, the firm he uses to manage his personal retirement accounts.Mr. Rizzi\u2019s suit accused the bank of violating the Americans With Disabilities Act by \u201cdenying access to its websites to individuals with disabilities who are visually impaired\u201d and who require screen-reader software to access digital content. Mr. Rizzi also cited the bank for not having an accessibility website or hotline. The case, which sought about $9 million in damages, was settled last summer, his lawyer, Lambros Lambrou, said.In a separate case, Wells Fargo in 2011 settled an investigation by the Justice Department alleging A.D.A. violations because the bank failed to accept what is known as video relay services, or video phone calls, from deaf customers. The settlement required the bank to pay $16 million to some account holders and remedy a variety of accessibility problems.Despite the passage of the A.D.A., lawsuits and heightened awareness of the needs of people with disabilities, obstacles to investing and money management persist. The fix often requires reverse-engineering software and procedures, which can be costly and time consuming. There are signs that some financial services companies are rethinking their approach to accessibility, but customers remain concerned.\u201cI am still struggling to read the statements from my brokerage account, and am often left to rely on sighted assistance, which can expose me to identity theft or worse,\u201d Mr. Rizzi said. Recently, his personal financial information was compromised. \u201cThere is significant room for improvement across the board, and I have yet to, personally or professionally, find that one institution that has it right.\u201dBy many accounts, the pool of blind and deaf retirement investors is small \u2014 not just because of accessibility problems but also because those people face low wages, unemployment, underemployment and a lack of financial literacy. The average annual earned income for an American with a disability is $26,487 \u2014 38 percent less than for someone without a disability, according to a 2018 report by the American Institutes for Research. The Labor Department reports that only about 19 percent of people with a disability are employed, compared with nearly 66 percent of people without a disability.The low work force participation rate is \u201cdue to the high number of people who see a better income from entitlements or the many who have not seen success in landing a job and more or less have given up trying,\u201d said Chris Soukup, chief executive of Communication Service for the Deaf. This makes it harder for them to save for retirement through a job.Knowing workers\u2019 needsRetirement planning, however, is still relevant for people with disabilities, and some financial advisers have tailored their practice to help people even if they have few assets.Lee Kramer, the founder of Kramer Wealth Managers, is deaf and says the mission of his firm is to \u201cbridge the gap between the financial world and the deaf community by providing comprehensive wealth management services accessible in A.S.L.\u201dMr. Kramer\u2019s staff is fluent in American Sign Language and often use videophones. Mr. Kramer said the firm\u2019s clientele included 85 percent deaf and 15 percent hearing customers, and unlike many firms, his does not require a minimum investment from any of them. \u201cWe feel we have a duty of service to the deaf community,\u201d he said.Among Kramer\u2019s clients are the Deaf-Hearing Communication Center in Swarthmore, Pa., and its 13 full-time employees.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go through somebody to have a conversation about what we need,\u201d said Neil McDevitt, the executive director of the nonprofit center, which provides sign language interpreting and real-time captioning services. \u201cSo if I want to talk to Mr. Kramer, I can call him on the videophone and we can have a conversation directly.\u201dEven though certified interpreters are bound by confidentiality, some people may feel uncomfortable sharing financial information through a third party, and not every interpreter is equally versed in financial terminology.Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0Feb. 4, 2022, 1:43 p.m. ETHere\u2019s what you need to know about the January jobs report.Architects at a prominent New York firm drop their unionization bid.Hertz hires a former Goldman Sachs finance chief as its C.E.O.Mr. McDevitt, whose father was a financial planner, recalled many conversations at his family\u2019s dinner table about saving for the future. Unfortunately, he said, many deaf children, especially those with hearing parents, miss out on these vital talks. A Gallaudet University survey found that the majority of deaf children are born to hearing parents and that fewer than a quarter of families use sign language regularly at home.\u201cFinancial literacy has always been a challenge because for a very, very long time the hearing community didn\u2019t quite believe that we could be or should be financially independent,\u201d Mr. McDevitt said.Kramer Wealth Managers has taken steps to improve this by maintaining a sign language library on a variety of topics, including annuities, bear and bull markets and wills, and a vlog with market commentary in sign language.Mr. Kramer said he uses his knowledge of ABLE plans (tax-advantaged saving plans for people with disabilities that do not affect eligibility for public benefits), Social Security Disability Income and vocational rehabilitation support to develop financial plans for deaf clients. The firm also maintains a network of A.S.L.-fluent professionals including lawyers, accountants, mortgage brokers and real estate agents for client referrals.Gena Harper, a senior vice president for Morgan Stanley in Oakland, Calif., begins her day at 5:30 a.m. commuting with Yulie, her seeing-eye dog. As both a financial adviser and an investor who is blind, Ms. Harper said she relied on VoiceOver on her iPhone; the screen-reader program known as Job Access With Speech, which she uses to navigate her computer and to read PDFs, Excel and Word documents; and a Braille embosser and display.Still, \u201ctechnology is the hugest impediment,\u201d she said, because many of Morgan Stanley\u2019s internal systems and apps remain \u201cvery inaccessible.\u201d Getting her work done requires a lot of human intervention by a technology team devoted to helping her and other colleagues who are blind.Despite the hurdles, \u201cI truly find a way,\u201d she said of working with customers who have disabilities. Her practice does not require a minimum investment from any clients, which is not true of all Morgan Stanley financial advisers. \u201cSo even if you don\u2019t have any money or you have very little money, we will give you guidance.\u201dMs. Harper said that in the last year, Morgan Stanley had made \u201ca huge commitment with money, resources and people to make their systems accessible\u201d and that her conversations with senior management led to the creation of the tech team.Access at big institutionsAdvocates for people with disabilities remain concerned about the blind and deaf client experience with big mutual fund companies like Vanguard and Fidelity.\u201cMost, if not all, of customer service help desk personnel have not been trained in inclusion, digital equity or what tools the disability community uses to navigate digital platforms, and we have a dead end at the first point of entry,\u201d Mr. Rizzi of My Blind Spot said.Amber DeRosa, the manager of Vanguard\u2019s accessibility office, said Vanguard\u2019s phone associates were trained to answer questions a blind client might ask and how to handle a deaf customer\u2019s video call. They can also connect the customer with Vanguard\u2019s accessibility team. Vanguard\u2019s first accessibility website went live at the end of May.\u201cWe\u2019re making sure that anything new that we develop going forward has accessibility built in from the beginning,\u201d she said. Vanguard does not provide Braille statements to customers. But Ms. DeRosa said the company was making improvements to its websites, mobile apps and PDF account statements so that they were more compatible with screen readers.Some blind Vanguard investors reported not being able to make an independent stock trade online and having to call customer service to complete the transaction, which typically carries a higher transaction fee. Ms. DeRosa said the company \u201cwould always waive any type of fees\u201d resulting from accessibility problems.Fidelity has about 200 retail locations nationwide, which are equipped with Video Relay Interpretation services \u201cso that an American Sign Language interpreter can be summoned within a minute to assist,\u201d said Fidelity\u2019s customer accessibility lead, Hale Pulsifer. An interpreter can also be provided on site on request, he added.Mr. Kramer said Fidelity was one of the last companies to accept video relay calls and that there were problems with 401(k) account call centers. A few months ago, one of his clients placed a video call and Fidelity refused to take it, he said. \u201cThey required him to go to a physical location to verify his identity before they would take his instructions over the phone.\u201dMr. Pulsifer said Fidelity accepted video calls and had \u201cthe same identity verification process for every caller.\u201d He added that Fidelity tried to ensure that its websites and apps were \u201coptimized\u201d for screen-only use and keyboard-only use, and that any videos contained closed captioning. Fidelity also provides large print, Braille and audio statements and tests its websites with the latest browsers and screen readers.Advocates say that the 61 million people living with disabilities in the United States constitute a significant market force that has largely been overlooked. It\u2019s also likely to expand.Mr. Rizzi of My Blind Spot said he wanted companies to \u201cacknowledge that we are all \u2018temporarily able\u2019 and will age into the disability community through no choice of our own.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/books/review/ilya-kaminsky-deaf-republic-poems.html", "headline": "A Soldier Kills a Deaf Boy, and Rebels Respond With a Barricade of Silence", "date": "2019-04-06T12:52:53+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "DEAF REPUBLICPoemsBy Ilya KaminskyThe scholar of religion Albert Blackwell has remarked of Bach\u2019s \u201cSt. Matthew Passion\u201d that its \u201cchorales are not dramatic music, but they impart musical drama.\u201d Hymn verses appear five times in the oratorio, descending through the keys of E, E-flat and C major toward the darkness and radical tonal uncertainty of the Crucifixion itself. For others, like the directors Jonathan Miller and Peter Sellars, the drama of this musical work has required actual staging.It could be said of the poet and critic Ilya Kaminsky\u2019s new book, \u201cDeaf Republic\u201d \u2014 his second full-length collection \u2014 that it is not dramatic poetry, but that it imparts poetic drama. What is essentially a collection of lyric poems is presented as if it were a play in two acts, including a list of \u201cDramatis Personae\u201d at the beginning. The characters, setting and action of this non-play seem to derive in an enigmatic way from the facts of Kaminsky\u2019s own life \u2014 he is described as \u201chard of hearing,\u201d was born in Odessa when it was part of the Soviet Union and emigrated to the United States at the age of 16 knowing no English \u2014 and in a direct way from his identity as a sentient human being in an age of global warfare against civilians. These poems bestow the power of sacred drama on a secular martyrology.[Read Ilya Kaminsky\u2019s essay for The Times Magazine about returning to the Odessa of his childhood.]Set in a town called Vasenka under martial law and including a chorus of townspeople as in ancient Greek drama, \u201cDeaf Republic\u201d traces the consequences of the murder of a deaf boy who spits at a sergeant while attending a puppet show (public gatherings have been outlawed) in the town square. This gives rise to an insurrection organized by a Mother Courage figure and puppeteer named Galya Armolinskaya in which some of the townspeople feign deafness to the soldiers as a gesture of civil disobedience. That deafness, however, is a morally ambiguous condition, for as Kaminsky presents it, it may be in one moment a kind of self-quarantine from surrounding corruption and at another an expression of the human tendency to remain indifferent to others\u2019 suffering. One poem declares, \u201cOur hearing doesn\u2019t weaken, but something silent in us strengthens,\u201d while another includes the double-edged line \u201cdeafness is our only barricade.\u201dImageIlya KaminskyCredit...Cybele Knowles/The University of Arizona Poetry CenterIn a narrative that is depressingly familiar to anyone who follows today\u2019s news, citizens are tortured and executed amid the horror of what emerges as a small-town civil war. It claims the lives of the newlyweds Alfonso and Sonya Barabinski, also puppeteers, whose erotic life flowers in the birth of Anushka, a child of the insurgency. Puppets are hung on the porches and doors of those arrested, like tokens for the angel of death. Briefly the rebellion gains the upper hand; one soldier is publicly executed, and others are strangled after being intoxicated by women. But by Act II, mass reprisals against citizens are taking place, and the soldiers are firebombing the stores of those suspected of participating in the rebellion. The cycle of repression and retribution appears to be unending. And lest any reader take comfort in the distance provided by reading these poems as parables rather than as news, Kaminsky begins the volume with a poem titled \u201cWe Lived Happily During the War,\u201d and elsewhere twice declares, \u201cOur country is the stage.\u201d The complacency of the United States, in the face of the wars it has made or supported, is as inescapable as its indictment.\u201cThen did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,\u201d goes the verse in the Gospel of Matthew describing the mocking of Christ. And that act of spitting \u2014 the ultimate gesture of hatred and contempt \u2014 recurs throughout \u201cDeaf Republic.\u201d Poetry lives by specifics (indeed, this is what makes it the most effective weapon against demagogy and tyranny), and Kaminsky is wonderfully attentive to such repeating patterns of details, contributing to the impression that his book is a through-composed whole, rather than simply a sequence of individual poems. Civilian warfare is conjured most effectively through occasional vivid images: \u201cTrolleys burst like intestines in the sun.\u201dIt is possible to speak of the deaf, referring to the physical condition, or the Deaf, referring to the cultural group. By situating these poems in a country at war, Kaminsky forces the reader to consider both the ways in which we define our social belonging and the loyalties according to which we operate. Sign languages used by deaf people vary according to country and geographical region. Interspersed in Kaminsky\u2019s text are pictographs depicting two human hands (the fingers steepled, for example, to indicate \u201ctown\u201d), belonging to a sign language that the book\u2019s notes indicate was invented by the citizens of Vasenka as they \u201ctried to create a language not known to authorities.\u201d Kaminsky\u2019s poems also engage with \u201cDeaf gain,\u201d the idea that there is a positive advantage to communication that is beyond verbal language, as they do with \u201caudism,\u201d the stance of cultural superiority based on the ability to hear. In \u201cDeaf Republic,\u201d hearing is a liability, and deafness is both an asset and a challenge, leading to the defiant declaration that \u201cThe deaf don\u2019t believe in silence. Silence is the invention of the hearing.\u201d The only silence in this book comes from God, who witnesses and does nothing: \u201cSuch is the story made of stubbornness and a little air\u2014 / a story signed by those who danced wordless before God.\u201dThe poet Anthony Hecht found in Kaminsky \u201ca superb and vigorous imagination, a poetic talent of rare and beautiful proportions,\u201d and part of the power of \u201cDeaf Republic\u201d lies in its exercise of the imagination, rather than what Kaminsky has identified as the \u201crelentless search for irony in things.\u201d There is irony, of course, when those who have been deaf to the suffering of others (and will be so again) choose to feign deafness as an eloquent response to oppression.

On average, the reporters made errors in two out of every five sentences, according to the study.The findings could have far-reaching consequences, as errors or misinterpretations in courtroom transcripts can influence the official court record in ways that are harmful to defendants, researchers and lawyers said.\u201cThe larger implication is that people are not being afforded a sense of fairness and justice because the system is not responding to their language,\u201d said Anthony L. Ricco, a New York-based criminal defense lawyer, when told of the study\u2019s findings.Decades of research has shown that the way some black people talk could play a role in their ability to secure things like employment or housing. The new study, scheduled for publication in June in the linguistic journal Language, provides insight on how using black dialect could also impact African-Americans in courtrooms.\u201cPeople who speak African-American English are stigmatized for so doing,\u201d said Taylor Jones, a doctoral student in linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the study\u2019s authors.Mr. Jones added that there was nothing improper or broken about the dialect that some African-Americans inherited over generations, but negative stereotypes have influenced the way people hear or perceive it.\u201cIf you\u2019re taught that these people speak incorrectly, then it\u2019s very easy to say, \u2018Well, they don\u2019t make any sense; what they\u2019re saying is wrong,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jones said.The researchers found that the court reporters were not transcribing with any malicious intent. But some of them did have a very limited understanding of black dialect.After going through the exercise, the researchers said that one of the court reporters told them that when they hear African-American English in the courtroom, \u201cI have to be like, \u2018Ok, don\u2019t roll your eyes,\u2019\u201d according to a draft copy of the study.Beyond negative stereotypes or lack of familiarity, a court reporter\u2019s own discomfort with some of the terminology used in black dialect could also lead to incorrect transcriptions, the study found.While Pennsylvania court reporters must score 95 percent accurate on tests in order to be certified, the reporters in this study were fully accurate, on average, on just 59.5 percent of the sentences.Black court reporters who participated in the study made errors in transcribing at roughly the same rate as their white peers.All of the reporters, in addition to transcribing, were asked to paraphrase what was being said in each sentence. Here, the results were even worse than the transcriptions, with reporters correctly paraphrasing the sentences about 33 percent of the time.The authors faulted the training that court reporters received, saying that it mostly used \u201cclassroom\u201d English. African-Americans are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, and so training should take that into consideration, researchers said.\u201cThe training isn\u2019t taking into account what they\u2019re actually going to hear,\u201d said Jessica Rose Kalbfeld, a co-author who is pursuing her Ph.D. at New York University.The transcription errors also speak to an impact of segregation, Mr. Jones said. When black and white people live in separate parts of a city, they develop their own ways of speaking that people outside of their cultural communities are not exposed to.\u201cBecause of segregation, black Philadelphians and white Philadelphians pronounce the same words differently,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is common across the United States.\u201dRiley H. Ross III, a lawyer in Philadelphia, said that it was not just black dialect that was often misunderstood in a courtroom. It happens with other races, too, he said, and it was up to him as a lawyer to intervene in real time.\u201cOver all, if there\u2019s something that\u2019s said that the jury won\u2019t understand, I\u2019ll bring it up,\u201d he said.While this study was based on recordings made outside of a formal court setting, transcription errors have seeped into real cases.In a 2015 transcript of a recorded phone call from a jail in the San Francisco Bay Area, a suspect who said, \u201cHe come tell \u2019bout I\u2019m gonna take the TV\u201d was incorrectly transcribed as \u201cI\u2019m gonna take the TV,\u201d according to a 2016 research paper by a pair of Stanford University linguists.In one recent case out of Louisiana, the transcription seemed to be correct, but it highlighted how African-American English can be subject to over-the-top scrutiny.A lawyer for a defendant who had admitted to sexual assault sought to have that admission suppressed because his client had initially asked for a lawyer, saying, \u201cI know that I didn\u2019t do it so why don\u2019t you just give me a lawyer dog \u2019cause this is not what\u2019s up.\u201dThe state\u2019s Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the police did not have to cease questioning him because \u201clawyer dog\u201d was ambiguous and did not necessarily mean that he was invoking his right to counsel.Mr. Ricco, the defense lawyer, said the most troubling thing about court reporters incorrectly transcribing African-American English was that it was indicative of larger difficulties of black witnesses trying to get their points across.\u201cIf the court reporters are missing the story,\u201d he said, \u201cthe jurors are missing the story.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/us/teenager-alaska-airlines-sign-language.html", "headline": "Teenage Girl Helps a Blind and Deaf Passenger and Wins Praise for Doing \u2018Something Beautiful\u2019", "date": "2018-06-24T21:39:04+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "The teenage girl was headed to California, and the man to Oregon.

But at least one group tends to get left out of the discussion.\u201cThere have been some deaf characters on television, but they are usually there so the hearing characters can learn something from them,\u201d Josh Feldman said. \u201cAnd then they send the deaf characters back into the shadows.\u201dHe said it with his hands. Sitting in a mellow cafe on a dilapidated strip of Melrose Avenue, he and his writing partner, Shoshannah Stern, carved shapes in the air to tell animated stories, volleys of sign language zinging across the table between them and their two interpreters.It was at this cafe that the pair first conceived a comic web series about two deaf best friends like themselves living in Los Angeles. On a warm winter morning three years later, they returned to discuss the television show that resulted from it: \u201cThis Close,\u201d debuting Wednesday, Feb. 14, on SundanceTV\u2019s streaming platform, Sundance Now.Created, written by and starring Ms. Stern and Mr. Feldman, the show follows the adventures of two deaf pals in Los Angeles. But the characters\u2019 deafness figures as just one sliver of an effervescent dramedy about friendship, romance, sex and ambition, its sweet but gritty tone inspired by series like \u201cLooking,\u201d \u201cGirls\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201dKate (Ms. Stern) is an exuberant entertainment publicist determined to make her way in the world without any special accommodations; neither her boss (Cheryl Hines) nor her fianc\u00e9 (Zach Gilford) make much effort to use sign language, expecting Kate to keep up with their conversation. Michael (Mr. Feldman) is a melancholy gay graphic novelist tortured by writer\u2019s block and trying to blot out the pain of a broken relationship with liquor and sex.The six-episode show is adapted from \u201cFridays,\u201d Ms. Stern\u2019s and Mr. Feldman\u2019s rom-comish web series that so impressed Sundance the channel decided to make \u201cThis Close\u201d the debut offering for its new digital streaming service.\u201cI thought to myself, have I ever seen a show where the characters are deaf but it doesn\u2019t define them?\u201d said Jan Diedrichsen, Sundance Now\u2019s general manager. \u201cThis felt like a fully realized vision of a life where deafness was just one part of it.\u201dMs. Stern grew up in the Bay Area dreaming of becoming an actor, even though there were few deaf role models on screen. For her seventh birthday she asked her mother for an agent. (The answer was no.) Later, during her senior year at Gallaudet University, a liberal arts college for the deaf in Washington D.C., she flew to Los Angeles for an audition and decided to stay.\u201cI thought, I will just convince people that it would be interesting to see me on screen and that it won\u2019t matter that I\u2019m deaf,\u201d she recalled, signing emphatically.Ms. Stern\u2019s first major role came as an antiterrorism expert in the short-lived 2003 ABC series \u201cThreat Matrix,\u201d and she has since become one of the most visible deaf actresses in Hollywood, appearing in series like \u201cWeeds, \u201cLie to Me\u201d and \u201cSupernatural.\u201d \u201cI was always the sole deaf person on set,\u201d she said.She met Mr. Feldman, an aspiring novelist and screenwriter, through mutual friends, and tried to help him get a foothold in Hollywood as a writer\u2019s assistant. But people were generally unwilling to meet with him.\u201cThey would ask, \u2018How would we communicate with him?\u2019 and \u2018How can he write dialogue if he doesn\u2019t speak?,\u2019\u201d Ms. Stern said. She decided that one way to change ideas about deafness, on screen and off, was for the duo to collaborate on a script.Mr. Feldman had never tried to write a deaf character, he said, because \u201cI thought no one would want to pay for anything that had deaf people in it.\u201d But Ms. Stern inspired him to try, and the result was \u201cFridays.\u201d After shooting a pilot for $250 with themselves in the lead roles, the duo put it on Kickstarter, hoping to raise enough cash to produce four episodes for YouTube.Pledges quickly shot past their $6,000 goal, much of the money donated by people who weren\u2019t deaf, Ms. Stern said. Also intrigued was Super Deluxe, an entertainment company owned by Turner. Super Deluxe produced five polished web episodes and screened them at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, where Mr. Diedrichsen saw in the show\u2019s \u201csingular vision\u201d an ideal original series for Sundance Now.Ms. Stern and Mr. Feldman revamped the concept to delve into pricklier emotional territory, with the help of the director Andrew Ahn (\u201cSpa Night\u201d).Much of the material in \u201cThis Close\u201d feels universal: Love affairs blossom and shatter, family members create emotional turmoil. But some of the stories naturally hinge on deaf-specific experiences, like a harrowing scene \u2014 based on something that actually happened to Ms. Stern\u2019s brother \u2014 in which a drunk Michael is yanked off an airplane, utterly confused and unable to communicate with airport police.At the center of the show is Kate and Michael\u2019s codependent friendship, which sometimes leaves hearing characters feeling left out. \u201cWe did a lot of two shots so that you could see both Josh and Shoshannah signing together,\u201d Mr. Ahn said. \u201cIt makes it feel like they are in a bubble of their own.\u201dMaking television from the perspective of deaf characters forced everyone involved to rethink the usual ways of doing things. \u201cSo much of narrative filmmaking convention is based in a hearing world, but if you have a super tight close-up, you won\u2019t see the hands,\u201d Mr. Ahn said.The director shot from low angles in order to capture both the characters\u2019 faces and their signing hands. Offscreen dialogue was mostly eliminated because \u201cto understand a line, you need to see it,\u201d he said.The production also hired many deaf crew members and actors (among them Marlee Matlin, who plays Michael\u2019s mother).\u201cIt changed the rhythm of shooting a little bit, because you have interpreters at all times,\u201d Ms. Hines said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like when you shoot in Montreal and the crew speaks French \u2014 it feels different but becomes normal very quickly.\u201dOne of the elements Ms. Stern was most interested in experimenting with was, perhaps surprisingly, sound. Movies and TV shows often portray the deaf perspective in terms of dead silence. But even when Ms. Stern turns her hearing aids off, she said, \u201cI am always feeling the blood pulsing through my veins and I am aware of what is happening inside of myself. That is my sound, and it is not a lack. It feels full to me, and I want to represent that through the soundscape of the show.\u201dIn one episode, viewers get a hint of how ordinary conversation filters through to Kate\u2019s ears: as a confusing muddle of staticky noise. However Michael, like Mr. Feldman, is profoundly deaf \u2014 his relationship to sound comes via its physical vibrations. This is expressed most strongly in a scene in a gay club, where he shimmies ecstatically, immersed in the sensuality of thumping bass all around him.A novice actor, Mr. Feldman flinched when he realized that he would have to strip for a graphic group sex scene. He had only himself to blame \u2014 after all, he was a co-writer in the episode in question. \u201cI knew that I had to do it, and I didn\u2019t want it to be inspirational sex or sweet, tender sex,\u201d he said, explaining that he \u201cwanted it to be dark\u201d to help ensure that the characters would not be mistaken for idealized role models.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel we have to educate people or represent our community well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want to tell a story about two people who are deaf.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/insider/how-we-used-vr-to-explore-what-music-feels-like-to-a-deaf-person.html", "headline": "How We Used VR to Explore What Music Feels Like to a Deaf Person", "date": "2017-11-05T14:23:13+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Seven years ago, when Rachel Kolb was 20, her friends pitched in to help her learn how to hear music. She was born profoundly deaf and had recently received a cochlear implant to give her partial hearing. \u201cThey were so gracious \u2014 they made a playlist and annotated it: At this time in the song, it\u2019s this instrument coming in,\u201d she recalled. \u201cSo I learned to recognize, oh, that\u2019s a piano, because my friend wrote down, \u2018At 35 seconds the piano starts to play.\u2019 \u201dRachel is a former Rhodes scholar and current doctoral student whom I met through Peter Catapano, the editor of the Disability series, on the Opinion desk. I work as a senior producer in the VR department at The Times, creating both long- and short-form virtual reality videos. Part of my job is constantly looking for stories that will fit our uniquely experiential medium.Peter introduced me to Rachel after she submitted an essay to him about her experiences of music both before and after receiving the implant. She described music as tactile and visual \u2014 not something that you just hear. We thought her story was a great match for the immersive treatment that virtual reality provides. We started to adapt Rachel\u2019s article into a storyboard and quickly settled on a VR piece that would be a mix of animation and live-action, with narration from Rachel.When we met Rachel in person, we were excited to see that she exhibited a natural on-camera presence \u2014 vibrantly intelligent and self-possessed. When we worked with her, she read our lips, since none of our team members knew American Sign Language (ASL). But lip-reading for more than two hours is tiring and it\u2019s a less effective method for large groups, so Rachel often uses a sign language interpreter.During our continuing conversations about the development of the piece, she suggested that we try to find another deaf collaborator for our team. This made a lot of sense, especially because we wanted to keep the piece deaf accessible and we knew that more deaf perspectives during the creative process would strengthen the final product. After some research, we found James Merry, an animator who works for the production company Squint/Opera in London.Sensations of SoundFor those who are deaf, music is not just about sound. In this immersive virtual reality experience, the scholar Rachel Kolb shares her experience of hearing music for the first time after receiving a cochlear implant.In person, James is quiet, but his animations are fast and lively. We nudged him toward a style that was loose and hand-drawn. (VR is very high-tech, and we wanted the animations to feel warm and approachable.) Luckily, James had already worked in VR and knew how to adapt his animations to an immersive environment. He was an easygoing collaborator, bringing new ideas to the table during each stage of development.James does not have a cochlear implant; he uses hearing aids. Like Rachel, he reads lips. Communicating on the phone with a deaf person is often not ideal, so we used video chat or email to correspond and give creative notes. I went to London to work with James and his colleagues for a few days, and interacting in person helped our process \u2014 but I could say that about any collaboration.\u201cWhen I work with voice-over, I\u2019m hardly ever able to work out what\u2019s being said from the voice track alone,\u201d James explained. \u201cI can hear when something is being said, but not so much what is being said. So I use a combination of the audio track and the transcript with time stamps. The audio waveform, which I can see on the computer screen, helps me to sync things up. If I still can\u2019t work it out, there\u2019s usually a friendly producer nearby who can help me fill in the gaps.\u201dAt one point, before we had a crucial sound cue built in, James threw in some sound cues himself, but the volume levels were really loud so he could hear them. When we watched and listened to that version together, the hearing collaborators dove for the volume. We all laughed about it and James apologized, but it taught us a lesson: James\u2019s sound cues were the only ones we felt as well as heard. That mattered for our sound design. In the moment when Rachel\u2019s cochlear implants are turned on, we aimed to have a sound cue that jolted us physically.We also wanted an acoustically extraordinary setting. Since there is a detail in Rachel\u2019s op-ed about her first experiences hearing live music after getting her implant, we asked her where those experiences happened and which ones were the most impactful. The Santa Fe Opera, near her home in New Mexico, was at the top of her list. It generously opened its doors, and the back wall of its open-air stage, so we could film Rachel there with a twilit desert backdrop.ImageRachel Kolb stands in front of Lytro\u2019s camera while Maureen Towey looks on.Credit...Marcelle Hopkins/The New York TimesWhile the animations were being developed, we landed a partnership with the technical wizards at Lytro to create our live-action scenes. Their light field technology can bring an extraordinary amount of depth and detail to a virtual reality image. The biggest VR camera we use regularly at The Times is about the size of a basketball. Lytro\u2019s camera is the size of a sumo wrestler. It gathers about 475 times more visual information than we do for a standard VR piece. Lytro\u2019s system also features Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF), which enables the viewer in aheadset to move around within the piece. If you are standing in front of a person, you can close the distance to them or step farther away. If you are watching an animation, you can crouch down or swivel to the side to see what the image looks like from a different angle. This freedom of movement increases the sense that you are right there with Rachel. It\u2019s what we call \u201cpresence\u201d \u2014 the magic of VR.During this process, we were also working closely with Brendan Baker, a sound designer whom I knew from his work on the podcast \u201cLove + Radio,\u201d which is known for its innovative use of sound in storytelling. I thought of him as the mad scientist of the podcast world, which was exactly what we needed to create a sound design that could accurately represent the sounds that Rachel was hearing when she first turned on her cochlear implant. The production company Q Department came in on the back end to spatialize the sound design so the sound would adjust as you moved your head in the headset.When Rachel got that playlist from her friends, she was trying to do something she hadn\u2019t done before: hear music. In working on this piece, we were trying to do some things we hadn\u2019t done before. We were trying to create a VR piece that was animated, that incorporated new 6DoF technologies and that told Rachel\u2019s story with the depth and sensitivity it deserved. In the VR department, our jobs are the most exciting when we can use a new technology to shine a light on an important story.There are several ways to experience \u201cSensations of Sound\u201d and other NYT VR pieces.

Did I like it? What did it sound like?I was 20 years old then. Aside from the amplified noises I\u2019d heard through my hearing aids, which sounded more like murmurs distorted by thick insulation swaddling, I had never heard music, not really. But that did not mean I wasn\u2019t in some way musical. I played piano and guitar as a child, and I remember enjoying the feel of my hands picking out the piano keys in rhythm, as well as the rich vibrations of the guitar soundboard against my chest. I would tap out a beat to many other daily tasks, too.For several years, I became privately obsessed with marching in rhythm when walking around the block, counting out my steps like a metronome: One, two. One, two. Watching visual rhythms, from the flow of water to clapping hands and the rich expression of sign language, fascinated me. But in the hearing world, those experiences often didn\u2019t count as music. And I gathered that my inability to hear music, at least in the view the people I knew, seemed unthinkable.\u201cSo you can\u2019t hear the beautiful music right now?\u201d I remember someone asking me when I was an undergraduate. We sat in a restaurant where, presumably, some ambient melody played in the background. When I said no, she replied, \u201cWow, that makes me feel sad.\u201dImageCredit...James MerrySad. This is how some hearing people reacted to my imagined lifetime without music. Did it mean that some part of my existence was unalterably sad, too? I resisted this response. My life was already beautiful and rich without music, just different. And even if listening to music did not yet feel like a core part of my identity, I could be curious.Once I got the cochlear implant, a transmitter of rough-hewn sound that set my skull rattling and my nerves screeching, I found that music jolted my core in ways I could not explain. Deep percussion rhythms burrowed into my brain and pulsed outward. A violin\u2019s melody pierced and vibrated in my chest, where it lingered long after the song had ended. Other tunes sounded overburdened, harsh and cacophonic, and I longed to shut them off and return to silence \u2014 as I still do.The new contrast I\u2019d found, between the thrill of sound and the relief of silence, showed me something that I had perhaps known for my entire life, but had never been able to articulate. Music was not just about sound. It never had been. Music, to me, also was, and is, about the body, about what happens when what we call sound escapes its vacuum and creates ripples in the world.The summer after I got my cochlear implant, I started to explore more of what music might mean to me. I picked out some notes on the piano again. I went to my first symphony concert. That overwhelming time, and all the new things I was hearing, gave me new license to go make music of my own. At the symphony, the cochlear implant whisked me into a flush of sound, but I was still enthralled by the visual \u2014 watching the physical artistry of the musicians with their instruments. Not long after, I discovered the art of music videos performed in American Sign Language. The work of talented deaf artists like Jason Listman and Rosa Lee Timm made some songs, which I\u2019d previously listened to with mild interest, suddenly roar to life. I watched those songs in A.S.L., and that was when I truly felt them, in a way an auditory or written rendering could never provide.ImageCredit...James MerrySoon after, I tried dancing. It wasn\u2019t that I hadn\u2019t danced before \u2014 just that I\u2019d felt embarrassed. There had been a time, once, when I\u2019d found myself on the dance floor surrounded by hearing friends who belted out song lyrics I couldn\u2019t understand. I\u2019d fielded the usual questions from them about how much of it I could really hear, which made me ask myself why I was there. Wasn\u2019t deaf dancing an oxymoron, after all? Now, as the deaf model Nyle DiMarco has clearly shown on \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d the answer is no \u2014 but I freely confess that, in the days before his performances, I had to discover this for myself.Again, my cochlear implant gave me license to try. When a friend persuaded me to go dancing for the first time in years, I discovered that, even though I undeniably enjoyed listening to the music, my favorite songs were the ones that thrummed with a deep rhythm, that sent the bass vibrating through my body. I danced not only by what I heard, but also by what I felt. The physical motion of dancing, once I released myself to it, swirled through my core. Then, when my friend and I started signing along to the lyrics, the realization hit me: this celebration of feeling, motion, sensation and language was what mattered when I experienced music.Not only does music ingrain itself in our bodies in ways beyond simply the auditory, it also becomes more remarkable once it does.\u201cCan you hear the music?\u201d Even though I now can, I think this question misses the point. Music is also wonderfully and inescapably visual, physical, tactile \u2014 and, in these ways, it weaves its rhythms through our lives. I now think a far richer question might be: \u201cWhat does music feel like to you?\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/movies/wonderstruck-deaf-actors-millicent-simmonds.html", "headline": "Making Room for Deaf Performers in Hollywood", "date": "2017-10-27T13:00:23+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Millicent Simmonds doesn\u2019t like scary movies, but it\u2019s not because they frighten her. The cawing of birds, the heavy breathing on the phone, the dun-dun-dun-dun of the approaching shark \u2014 these are largely lost on Ms. Simmonds, the 14-year-old ing\u00e9nue who has just made her debut in Todd Haynes\u2019s \u201cWonderstruck.\u201d She is deaf.\u201cScary movies depend on sound a lot to scare people,\u201d she said recently, signing in a FaceTime interview from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., as her mother interpreted off-camera. \u201cWhen I look around and see people are jumping in their seats, I think: Why? Why? Nothing happened!\u201dAccess is a prickly subject as old as Hollywood, or at least as old as the end of the silent era evoked in \u201cWonderstruck.\u201d Deaf and hearing audiences could delight equally in silent films. What\u2019s more, deaf actors appeared frequently, always as hearing characters; five found regular work onscreen, where facial expression and gestures signified more than moving lips. Charlie Chaplin cast the best known of them, Granville Redmond, in a handful of films.In the decades since, deaf audiences have struggled for equal access, and not just to movies that rely as heavily on sound as scary ones. Closed captioning is widely but not unfailingly available in theaters; that should improve by next summer, when all theaters showing digital movies must comply with a new federal rule under the Americans With Disabilities Act. As for performers, ask people to name deaf movie actors \u2014 or films about deaf people starring deaf people \u2014 and you\u2019ll probably get exactly one name and title: Marlee Matlin, who won an Oscar for her turn in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d 30 years ago. Then, crickets.Now comes \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d with its deaf star, deaf characters and homage to visual storytelling. The movie has cast a new spotlight on the hurdles facing deaf audiences, performers and storytellers in filmmaking, which trails well behind TV and streaming in every aspect of deaf experience.Millie Simmonds plays Rose, a lonely deaf girl in 1927 New Jersey enamored of silent movies and of one star in particular (played by Julianne Moore, the hearing actress who also plays the grown-up Rose). Rose\u2019s story alternates with that of Ben (Oakes Fegley), a Minnesota boy who becomes deaf when he is struck by lightning in 1977. In Brian Selznick\u2019s best-selling book, which he adapted for the screen, Rose\u2019s story is conveyed wordlessly in pencil drawings; Ben\u2019s is shared entirely in words. In the movie, her story unfolds without speech in black and white, his with blazing \u201970s pop color but \u2014 for nearly an hour \u2014 no dialogue.\u201cI was completely shocked by how little dialogue there was in the film,\u201d Mr. Haynes said in a phone interview. To approximate a nearly soundless world before production, he and Oakes wore noise-canceling headphones as they walked around New York City one day. He became aware of \u201cacute shards of visual information,\u201d he said, though he wasn\u2019t kidding himself that he had any idea what it was like to live deafness: \u201cThis was a thumbnail version of anything close to life.\u201dLike Rose and Ben, Carol Padden and her husband, Tom Humphries, who both teach at the University of California, San Diego, represent different deaf experiences. Ms. Padden, a MacArthur Fellow for her research in world sign languages, was born deaf to deaf parents and grew up in deaf culture. Mr. Humphries lost his hearing when he was 6, had no deaf family and did not learn sign language until he went to college. The couple were advisers for \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d both the book and the movie.Ms. Padden and Mr. Humphries would like to see more deaf actors in film \u2014 and not just as deaf characters. Deaf actors played nonspeaking hearing roles \u2014 a policeman and a maid, among others \u2014 in \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d and as a fun exercise, Ms. Padden said in an email, she tried to figure out who was deaf in the movie. \u201cThere was one I missed,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is a good sign of his acting. I heard that as they prepared to play their roles, they were told to look \u2018less intently\u2019 at others so they would seem more hearing.\u201dBut authenticity works both ways. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for hearing actors to look deaf to deaf viewers,\u201d Ms. Padden said, since American Sign Language is not just a finger alphabet but a system of expression employing the whole body. \u201cFor hearing viewers,\u201d she said, \u201cbeing \u2018deaf\u2019 is about signing, or seeming silent, but for deaf viewers, it\u2019s the entire embodiment of that life: the eyes, the shoulders, the hands, the walking and of course the looking. Until hearing viewers see deaf actors playing them, they may not realize entirely the hard work of embodying an entire different kind of life.\u201dMr. Haynes said there was discussion about hiring a deaf actor for the adult Rose, but he said the film needed stars to get financing and \u201cthe only role that offered itself that kind of status was the role of Rose.\u201d He turned to Ms. Moore. \u201cShe took on the responsibility of that character and the research with great seriousness.\u201dMr. Humphries, in an email, said that the movie \u201csucceeded way better than most,\u201d but he also said that \u201cyou can\u2019t achieve authenticity without much more participation of deaf people in all aspects of a movie about deaf people.\u201dEven films with deaf involvement can misstep by putting the hearing point of view first. In the summer hit \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d for example, the deaf actor and comedian CJ Jones is a scene stealer amid some Hollywood heavyweights. But Mr. Humphries pointed out that \u201cthe editing cut into CJ\u2019s signed lines so much we often couldn\u2019t see his signing\u201d and added, \u201cThat\u2019s reality, audiences are overwhelmingly hearing.\u201dMs. Matlin said that \u201cnot so much\u201d has changed since \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d when it comes to studio movies. In independent films, \u201cwhere budgets are smaller,\u201d she said, \u201crisks can be taken, and there has been some progress.\u201d A recent Ukrainian film, \u201cThe Tribe,\u201d has gone further than any Hollywood movie. It was filmed entirely in Ukrainian Sign Language, with a cast of deaf actors, and no subtitles or voice-overs.Still, Ms. Matlin pointed out that on TV and streaming services, \u201cthere are many, many deaf actors, writers, directors and producers \u2014 and lots of stories to tell.\u201dChief among those stories may have been the cable series \u201cSwitched at Birth,\u201d which ran for five seasons, featured multiple deaf actors and included an episode shot almost entirely in A.S.L. A current example is the ABC series \u201cQuantico,\u201d now shooting Season 3 in New York. Ms. Matlin (who had a recurring role in \u201cSwitched at Birth\u201d) joins the cast as an ex-F.B.I. agent who lost her hearing in a bomb blast. \u201cThey just put me in and have had no qualms about \u2018How do we do it?\u2019\u201d she emailed from the set.In films, by contrast, there isn\u2019t much nuance in telling the story of a deaf character, she said: \u201cUsually they\u2019re victims, or their deafness creates some sort of jeopardy.\u201dEthan Sinnott, director of the theater and dance program at Gallaudet University and a set designer, said that deaf theater professionals like him were not \u201cwaiting for hearing Hollywood to call\u201d but taking matters into their own hands.\u201cDeaf filmmaking is ascendant,\u201d he said in an email, \u201clikely due to the ease of communication afforded by a common language between deaf actors, creatives and techies.\u201d He also said that he was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by the success of \u201cSwitched at Birth,\u201d adding, \u201cI never thought I would ever see this in my lifetime.\u201dMillie Simmonds has seen neither \u201cThe Tribe\u201d nor \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d (they both have very adult themes), and she \u201cnever, never never\u201d dreamed of being an actress. \u201cI always wanted to be a cop or a fireman or do something dangerous,\u201d she said. But here she was in Poughkeepsie, already at work in her second movie, \u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. She has no time to watch noisy scary movies anytime soon, even if she wanted to."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/us/sign-language-interpreter-irma.html", "headline": "Sign Language Interpreter Warned of \u2018Pizza\u2019 and \u2018Bear Monster\u2019 at Irma Briefing", "date": "2017-09-17T19:57:20+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "As Hurricane Irma charged toward Florida, officials in a county on the state\u2019s west coast held a news conference to inform residents of mandatory evacuation orders for those most at risk.\u201cWe just need you to be safe,\u201d Robin DiSabatino of the Board of County Commissioners in Manatee County said at the Sept. 8 briefing.

No one could see his hands!!!!\u201d another person commented.\u201cIt was atrocious,\u201d said Howard A. Rosenblum, the chief executive of the National Association of the Deaf.Mr. Rosenblum, who is deaf, said through an interpreter in a phone interview that the association considered what happened a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act. \u201cWe believe that Manatee County failed to provide information to the deaf and hard-of-hearing community to the same extent that it provided to all others,\u201d he said.Experts who reviewed the video said the interpreter spelled the wrong words and gesticulated gibberish.Mr. Rosenblum tried to decipher the beginning, starting when officials announced the evacuation, but he could only make out a jumble of disconnected phrases. \u201cOn that news\u201d was followed by \u201cneed evacuate\u201d and later, \u201cpray wait water.\u201dThe interpreter also appeared at a news conference later that day \u2014 wearing the same yellow shirt.The county posted highlights from its news conferences on Facebook, including a searchable map of evacuation zones and information about shelters. But being unable to understand the live news conferences put the deaf population on edge.\u201cIt was really a stressful day for sure,\u201d Julie Beacham-Hooie, 47, who is deaf, said through an interpreter in a phone interview.\u201cI was watching the interpreter and seeing him spelling and spelling and spelling, and not fully signing,\u201d said Ms. Beacham-Hooie, who lives in Bradenton, Fla., about 45 miles south of Tampa, Fla. \u201cIt was very hard to follow.\u201dShe turned to the internet for more information and relied on her sister in Nevada. \u201cI asked other people if the hurricane was actually headed straight for us,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no idea.\u201dPhyllis Corbett, 57, another Bradenton resident who is deaf, said through a translator that the interpreter was \u201ctotally unqualified.\u201d\u201cIt really scared me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in an emergency situation here. It was a life and death thing.\u201dThe interpreter, identified by the county as Marshall Greene, could not be reached for comment.Nicholas Azzara, a spokesman for the county, said in an email that Mr. Greene, who is a lifeguard for a county-run beach, has a brother who is deaf. Mr. Greene was asked to sign because there was little time to find an interpreter before the news conference.It\u2019s not unusual for family members of the deaf to have only a rudimentary understanding of American Sign Language, said Beth Barnes, a certified sign language interpreter who has several deaf family members, including her parents.Ms. Barnes, with help from her sister, posted a proper interpretation of the news conference in a video on Facebook that afternoon.\u201cI just knew that it was very important information that needed to be shared immediately because they were closing the hospital,\u201d said Ms. Barnes, who lives in Clearwater, Fla.County leaders told the Tampa television station WFLA that they called on Mr. Greene because they were \u201cin a pinch.\u201d But Mr. Rosenblum said the search for an interpreter should have never been done so hastily.Nearby Sarasota County used a qualified interpreter at its news conferences, he said.M. Charlene McCarthy, the founder of VisCom, a sign language interpreting agency in Florida, said that her company often provided interpreters to Manatee County but that nobody asked for help with the Irma news conferences.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t call,\u201d she said.The unintelligible signing was unlike anything she had ever seen, Ms. McCarthy said, with the exception of the man who masqueraded as an interpreter at Nelson Mandela\u2019s memorial service in 2013.Other interpreters have gained attention on social media for the opposite reason \u2014 because they were universally admired. Sam Harris, the sign language interpreter for Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, earned praise for his animated expressions during Irma, and Lydia Callis, a celebrated presence at news conferences for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, inspired online tributes as well as a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch contrasting the styles of interpreting Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.Ms. McCarthy said she had offered to send a certified interpreter to a Sept. 9 news conference, but the county declined and did not use an interpreter that day. Mr. Azzara, the Manatee County spokesman, said he could not immediately comment on the matter.County officials are now taking steps to avoid repeating their mistake. The county is searching for a professional sign language vendor for future emergencies, Mr. Azzara wrote."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/jobs/how-to-turn-challenges-like-deafness-into-gifts.html", "headline": "How to Turn Challenges Like Deafness Into Gifts", "date": "2017-06-23T18:42:59+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Lauren Mackiewicz, 32, is a job coach at Easterseals in East Brunswick, N.J.Q.

They glistened, tiny sparks of light, before I realized he was up to his chin in cold water. And I realized that if I called his name, if I screamed it, the word would sink like stone.When Micah turned 2 we had learned that he was profoundly deaf. In the audiologist\u2019s office, an auditory brain response concluded he couldn\u2019t hear a helicopter. \u201cYou\u2019re taking this well,\u201d the doctor had said. But later, as I watched Micah step deeper into the Gulf water, I wanted to rage. I was so angry, I could have torn the beach apart.We celebrated his third birthday, and the audiologist turned his cochlear implants on for the first time.I said, \u201cHi Micah, can you hear mommy?\u201d His hazel eyes widened and he screamed in terror, his body trembling. Shock.In American Sign Language, the sign for cochlear implant is similar to the sign for vampire. Vampire is signed with two fingers like teeth to the throat. Cochlear implant is signed with two fingers like teeth behind the ears. The audiologist told me not to sign at all. She said sign language was a crutch that would hinder his speech. When he heard my voice for the first time, his cry was guttural, a stab wound. He was bitten by sound.The audiologist adjusted the pitch and tuned the levels to make a simulation of sound. She called this process mapping, but there were no guideposts to show the way. How do you chart loneliness? How do you trace a landscape of silence and sound between mother and son?At home, I wrapped my legs around my toddler and pinned him to the carpet in what looked like a wrestling hold as I tried to keep the processors for his implants on his head. He was crying, and I was crying, and I wondered if my actions could be considered abuse.He refused to wear the $18,000 sound processors, and his defiance was feral: head butts to my face, kicks, bites. The back of his head smacked against my jaw, and for a moment everything went black. The implant surgery alone had cost $50,000. Auditory verbal therapy was out of pocket, the doctors were out of network. What choice did I have but to force him?When Helen Keller wouldn\u2019t cooperate, her teacher Annie Sullivan used brute force. In \u201cThe Story of My Life,\u201d Sullivan described how teaching obedience to the deaf and blind girl had to precede teaching language. Sullivan compared her work with Keller to housebreaking a dog. She wrote, \u201cto get her to do the simplest thing, such as combing her hair or washing her hands or buttoning her boots, it was necessary to use force, and of course a distressing scene followed.\u201dTo sign the word force, spread your fingers wide and grip an imaginary face with the palm of your hand. With a quick motion, shove the face into an invisible water bucket and don\u2019t let the head rise for air.Each week, I dragged him to speech therapy. Let the ritual of F begin: His upper teeth on his lower lip as he tried to blow a scrap of paper off the back of his hand. Next came the puh and guh with its grunts and grimaces.He didn\u2019t resist. He gagged his hands. He let his fingers slip dumb at his sides. He tucked his hands into his pockets like two clipped birds.Micah was prelingually deaf, meaning his deafness preceded language. Doctors say there is a critical window from birth to 12 months for language acquisition. By the time he was 4 years old, he had a severe language delay, and I feared that his window for language was closing. When I spoke to him, I observed his stoic expression and panic knotted my stomach.In public, his meltdowns drew unwanted attention on playgrounds and in grocery stores. How had I become the dejected mother in the fruit aisle, helpless as Micah bucked and cried, dangerously hitting his head on the linoleum floor? I felt the eyes of other shoppers watching our distressing scene with pity, others with harsh disappointment, but no one could have been more disappointed in me than myself. I was failing him.Then I took one too many of his head butts to the chin and woke up paralyzed on the right side of my face. I couldn\u2019t blink. I couldn\u2019t smile. The doctor said it was trauma to the seventh cranial nerve, causing facial muscles to weaken \u2014 as happens with Bell\u2019s palsy. My face drooped like a stroke victim\u2019s and for two months, I used a patch over my unblinking eye.There is no particular sign for the word desperate. Instead, it is conveyed by a panicked facial expression. But my face was frozen, much like Micah\u2019s voice. Stuck.I blamed myself. I was no Annie Sullivan. I couldn\u2019t break him, and instead, he was breaking me.I gave up on spoken English, and enrolled in American Sign Language classes at the local community college. Micah\u2019s first sign was flower. To sign flower, the right hand grasps an imaginary stem and holds it first against the right nostril and then against the left, and like a flower, Micah blossomed one new sign at a time and took his implants off his head for good.The first time he told me a story, he was 6. We were eating greasy burgers and fries in a diner\u2019s pleather booth, and he told me about a dream from the night before. Our mouths were full, chewing, lips sealed, but his story continued with rapid-fire signs.Sometimes, when we lie side by side in the dark, he places a small hand on my throat to feel my voice, a gesture as intimate as a lullaby, and I consider the symphony of touch. On my skin, I feel his palm outstretch, feeling for vibration, and I think of my voice as a petal pressed between locked pages.In the dark, his hand reaches up to speak, and I shine a flashlight on his fingers. They make rapid shadow puppets onto the bedroom wall, and I understand his story like a hieroglyph. I see his voice. I hear his face. His pristine silence fills a room far more than sound."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/29/t-magazine/entertainment/punk-rock-for-deaf-people-queens.html", "headline": "Scenes From a Punk Rock and Storytelling Show, for Deaf People", "date": "2016-04-29T20:07:40+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "At its best, punk rock relies on an admixture of velocity, attitude and volume \u2014 which is exactly what made last night\u2019s Deaf Club event a smash success. The show, held at the Knockdown Center in Maspeth, Queens, a former door factory turned interdisciplinary arts space, was curated by the Los Angeles-based artist Alison O\u2019Daniel who, herself, is hard of hearing. The event was a live extension of O\u2019Daniel\u2019s \u201cThe Tuba Thieves\u201d (currently a part of her \u201cRoom Tone\u201d exhibition) \u2014 a film that explores the events surrounding an unlikely series of tuba thefts in Los Angeles schools.One portion, however, also recreates a performance in the Deaf Club, a now-defunct social club for San Francisco\u2019s deaf community that hosted punk shows in 1979. As the story goes, Robert Hanrahan, the manager for the punk band the Offs, was walking by it, saw a sign reading \u201cThe Deaf Club\u201d and thought it was a cool, unexpected name for a concert venue. After realizing his mistake, he asked if his band could play \u2014 a message he originally wrote on a napkin. \u201cI\u2019m not a punk historian,\u201d said O\u2019Daniel. \u201cMy interest comes more from the deaf community. It\u2019s the meeting of two totally disenfranchised communities \u2014 it\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d Eventually, bands including Dead Kennedys and Pink Section would record albums at the venue, forever sanctifying it in punk lore. (A core irony of the story, and also fittingly punk, was that the shows eventually came to a halt because of noise complaints.)But the goal of last night\u2019s event wasn\u2019t an attempt to dispel hearing people\u2019s outmoded assumption that the deaf world doesn\u2019t (or can\u2019t) appreciate music \u2014 though that notion seemed ready to explode along with the tower of amps \u2014 but rather, to create an environment where people of all ages and backgrounds could revel in the power of punk and performance art. Among the performers, many of whom helped with the making of O\u2019Daniel\u2019s film, were three bands and four American Sign Language storytellers, each of whom approached the night with their own interpretation of the Deaf Club theme. Wall, a Brooklyn four-piece, brought No Wave clamor and cutting politics to the stage, while Future Punx arrived with fog machines and New Wave synths in tow. Also appearing was a band with a name unpublishable in this publication \u2014 which only serves to solidify its street cred. (The frontman, Paddy Mulloy, played an M.C. in O\u2019Daniel\u2019s film.)Between the sets, performers told stories of identity \u2014 comedic anecdotes, personal hardships and the deaf world\u2019s relationship with music. Maleni Chaitoo drew a through line between the alienation of punk in the \u201970s and the underserved Deaf community, while Opal Gordon, who closed out the show, traced black history through the lens of music, using a combination of A.S.L. and interpretive dance to spin a tale that moved from the slave trade, to the her own story of embracing pop music as a deaf, African-American woman. \u201cIt\u2019s not true that deaf people can\u2019t enjoy music,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cMusic is strong, they can feel the vibrations. Punk is perfect because it\u2019s loud, it\u2019s heavy, it\u2019s in-your-face.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/nyregion/deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-fight-to-be-heard.html", "headline": "Deaf and Hard of Hearing Fight to Be Heard", "date": "2016-03-25T22:29:56+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Lydia Callis wanted to get her mother a gym membership for Christmas last year. When she called to arrange a consultation, she mentioned that her mom (who lives in Arizona) is deaf and would need a sign-language interpreter for the session. The health club said it would not provide a signer. Ms. Callis \u2014 who became an Internet sensation during Hurricane Sandy as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s exuberant sign-language interpreter \u2014 told the club that it was actually required by law to do so. Still it refused, and Ms. Callis, who was calling from Manhattan, gave up.Last year was the 25th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, and yet this kind of scenario plays out regularly for people who are deaf and hard of hearing. While the broader culture has become accustomed to certain changes the law has engendered, particularly wheelchair access, the rights of the deaf have frequently been misunderstood or simply disregarded.Recently, however, a deaf rights movement has begun to gain ground, particularly in New York.One sign of this momentum has been a flurry of lawsuits. Last year, the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services settled a case that charged its shelters with failing to provide American Sign Language interpreters for deaf residents, and a suit filed last summer in Westchester County claimed that two hospitals refused a deaf couple\u2019s requests for interpreters after the husband had a heart attack.Another case involved Diana Williams, a deaf woman from Staten Island who was arrested in 2011 and was denied a sign-language interpreter, as the federal law dictates. In October, the Police Department settled her lawsuit for $750,000. Her lawyers, from the Eisenberg & Baum Law Center for Deaf and Hard of Hearing, said it was one of the biggest payouts of its kind.\u201cWhat\u2019s disturbing about all these lawsuits is that the A.D.A. has been in effect for several decades,\u201d Eric Baum, one of the firm\u2019s founders, recently said. Mr. Baum said that his firm had litigated about 100 deaf discrimination cases, roughly half in the New York metropolitan area, many dealing with a failure to provide interpreters. He was sitting in the Union Square office alongside the Law Center\u2019s co-directors: Andrew Rozynski, a lawyer and fluent A.S.L. signer whose parents are deaf, and Sheryl Eisenberg-Michalowski, a deaf rights liaison who was born deaf.According to Mr. Rozynski, many other law firms turn down such cases because they don\u2019t want to pay for interpreters or are in the dark about deaf culture and A.D.A. law. These are exactly the sort of cases that the Law Center, now in its fifth year, was created to handle. (One of the few other places specializing in this work, the New York Center for Law and Justice, a nonprofit that offers legal and social services to indigent people who are deaf or hard of hearing, has been handling an array of cases for over a decade. About five years ago, it also began taking on A.D.A. discrimination suits, including the one against the Department of Homeless Services.)The law as it applies to its typical violators \u2014 police departments, hospitals, schools, government agencies or businesses \u2014 is clear enough, Mr. Baum said.ImageMaleni Chaitoo, center, at a happy hour event that was held for deaf and hard of hearing at Pop Pub in East Village.Credit...Damon Winter/The New York Times\u201cBut time and time again,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople ignore the laws that are written.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, he added, some A.D.A. violators have been sued multiple times, including the New York Police Department, which the Law Center has filed three suits against.\u201cEven though the Department of Justice forced them into an agreement,\u201d said Mr. Rozynski, referring to a 2009 consent agreement requiring the Police Department to follow the provisions of the A.D.A., \u201cthey\u2019re still flouting the law.\u201dThis spring, however, the department is introducing a pilot program in three precincts aimed at helping the deaf and hard of hearing gain greater access to police services, said Susan Herman, a deputy commissioner. The program will give the department access to two A.S.L. interpreting agencies, Ms. Herman said. (The current policy allows such interpreters only for scheduled events.) In addition, supervisors will have tablet computers for quick access to sign-language interpreters provided by a translation service on Skype.These changes are exactly what the Law Center has been striving for. \u201cWe want to make sure that there is a correction,\u201d Mr. Baum said. Lawsuit by lawsuit, their fight broadcasts a message.Ms. Callis, the owner of LC Interpreting Services, said recently that she noticed a rise in requests for interpreters, which she chalked up to greater awareness of the law, not to mention a desire not to get sued. Ms. Callis, 34, was the only hearing person in a deaf family. A longtime advocate of deaf rights, she said her star turn with Mayor Bloomberg during his Hurricane Sandy news conferences made people \u201caware that deaf culture exists all around them.\u201dOne of her firm\u2019s services is to offer cultural competency training to help businesses integrate their deaf employees.\u201cDeaf people are becoming more aware of their rights and are learning to stand up for themselves,\u201d she said.Yet Ms. Callis argued that government has a role to play, like requiring licenses for A.S.L. interpreters \u2014 a bill proposing this has stalled in the New York State Senate. She also pointed out that New York State, unlike many states, does not have a commission for the deaf and hard of hearing.One development came on March 14, when Mayor Bill de Blasio signed into law bills that will benefit the deaf and hard of hearing; one calls for all city agencies to have a staff member dedicated to assisting people with disabilities, while another requires that all promotional materials for public events organized by the city detail what forms of accessibility will be available, such as sign language, Braille or large print.ImageMayor Michael R. Bloomberg during a new conference about Hurricane Sandy. Ms. Callis\u2019s expressiveness helped to make her an Internet sensation.Credit...Andrew Burton/Getty ImagesAccording to a 2014 census, there are around 208,000 people in New York City who are deaf or hard of hearing.So it should come as no surprise that many events in the city cater to the deaf: museum tours, poetry slams, deaf-friendly happy hours.At one happy hour this year, a group of people gathered at Pop Pub in the East Village. They greeted one another with hugs, sipping drinks and chatting as any bar patrons would \u2014 but they were talking with their hands.Maleni Chaitoo was at a table conversing with a friend. A native New Yorker in her late 30s who lives in Chelsea, she produces a web series, acts and works at the outfitter Patagonia with an iPad in hand, which allows her to text-chat with customers. \u201cI see it as a job to show hearing people that they can interact with deaf people,\u201d she said through an interpreter.Though this was her first time coming to happy hour at Pop Pub, she saw lots of familiar faces from school or from other A.S.L. events. \u201cI came here to get my fix in my native tongue,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to socialize with people who can sign. I call them \u2018my A.S.L. people,\u2019 who are deaf and hearing.\u201dAlso present was Opal Gordon, 53, who lives in the East Village and is unemployed. (According to a 2013 study by the Annual Disability Statistics Compendium, only around 50 percent of deaf and hard-of-hearing people in the United States are employed.) \u201cI love New York \u2014 this is my city,\u201d Ms. Gordon, wearing red pants and a matching hat and lipstick, said through an interpreter. \u201cI\u2019m used to this life, but deaf people struggle every day.\u201dThough hearing people sometimes react to her with apprehension, Ms. Gordon said, she is adept at navigating their world, and when she goes to a store or restaurant, things tend to be fine. \u201cTake this situation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a bar, we look like normal people and we\u2019re able to interact. It just takes a bit more patience from people who can hear. We can even text back and forth.\u201dLast September, however, when she was arrested for violating an order of protection, police officers did not try to communicate with her and failed to provide a sign-language interpreter for more than 20 hours during her custody, she said. With the Law Center for Deaf and Hard of Hearing, Ms. Gordon is suing.\u201cI feel strong,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight on behalf of the deaf community.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/theater/lights-gestures-action-how-to-stage-a-broadway-musical-with-deaf-actors.html", "headline": "Lights, Gestures, Action!

But for this \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d the director Michael Arden, the choreographer Spencer Liff and the actors themselves have devised an array of silent cues: hidden lights, coded gestures, timed touches and prompting props.\u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d a darkly tragic drama about adolescent sexuality in a repressive community, was written as a play by Frank Wedekind in 1891, and then adapted into a rock musical by Steven Sater and Duncan Sheik in 2006. The adaptation was a hit on Broadway \u2014 it won eight Tony awards, including for best new musical, provided starmaking roles to Lea Michele (\u201cGlee\u201d), Jonathan Groff (\u201cHamilton\u201d) and John Gallagher Jr. (\u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d), and ran for just over two years.Mr. Arden, who has been collaborating with the Los Angeles troupe Deaf West Theater since appearing in their Broadway revival of \u201cBig River\u201d in 2003, thought that \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d which he viewed as \u201ca cautionary tale about the perils of miscommunication,\u201d would have great resonance with a deaf cast. Both \u201cBig River\u201d and this \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d had two productions in Los Angeles before transferring to Broadway.Without altering the Sater-Sheik book or lyrics, Mr. Arden has added a new context for the story. The deaf actors portray deaf students in a school that does not allow the use of sign language, implicitly nodding to a historical event (contemporaneous with the play\u2019s setting in late 19th-century Germany) in which an international conference of educators called for the mandatory and exclusive use of oralism (lip reading and speech) when teaching deaf students.ImageThe \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d stage manager, T. J. Kearney, cues deaf actors with lights in different colors \u2014 at the stage entrances, on a balcony rail, even in a trapdoor beneath the stage.Credit...Caitlin Ochs for The New York TimesIn one scene, a teacher, played by Patrick Page, can be seen threatening students who use sign language, attempting to train the deaf to speak by having them feel, and then mimic, the movement of his mouth and throat, and by having them watch the impact of vocalizations on a feather held in front of the face.In this \u201cSpring Awakening,\u201d which opened to good reviews on Sept. 27, the deaf actors are at the center: Mr. Arden has asked the cast, and is now expecting audiences, to focus attention on the signing, not the singing. The deaf actors are often downstage and lighted from the front; their hearing partners are generally lighted from behind, and in ensemble numbers the cast members look toward the signers.\u201cIt is highly important that the performance is the deaf actors\u2019, and the hearing actors are following their intention \u2014 we get in trouble if we get ahead of them,\u201d said the actress Camryn Manheim, a onetime sign language interpreter who is making her Broadway debut playing several adult women in the show.Ms. Manheim, like the other hearing actors, has found ways to prompt deaf actors in her scenes; for example, at one point she opens a letter to indicate to Sandra Mae Frank, a deaf actress playing her daughter, that it is time for her to start signing.ImageAt various points, actors tap one another to signal a cue; in the song \u201cTouch Me,\u201d shown, hearing actors squeeze the shoulders of deaf actors to synchronize the group\u2019s forward movement to the beat of the music as they ferry Miles Barbee across the stage.Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York Times\u201cIt is remarkable what they have built into the show, without your knowledge, to give people cues \u2014 all the hearing actors are doing double duty, giving cues that are cleverly woven into the show,\u201d she said.The devices used are myriad. The stage manager, T. J. Kearney, has installed red lights on the balcony rail, blue lights at stage entrances, and a white light in a trapdoor, all to alert deaf actors; during rehearsals, a large flashing light was used whenever the director called \u201cHold!\u201d Key messages from the creative team (\u201cCast to stage\u201d) are closed-captioned on video screens in dressing rooms.At one moment of the show, in which a group of actors forms a shiplike cluster and carries an actor across the stage, the hearing actors use their hands as metronomes, squeezing the shoulders of the deaf actors to synchronize the forward motion with the musical beat.\u201cIt can be a blink of an eye, a shrug of a shoulder, a tap of a leg \u2014 little ways we all know what we need to know,\u201d said Treshelle Edmond, a deaf actress who is making her Broadway debut as Martha, a schoolgirl who is abused by her father. Ms. Edmond said that not only did she study the mouth movements of the actress, Kathryn Gallagher, who sings and speaks for her character, but she also spent time holding Ms. Gallagher\u2019s guitar as it was played, learning from vibration to understand her songs\u2019 rhythm.ImageVideo screens are installed in key locations, including dressing rooms, to relay important instructions.Credit...Caitlin Ochs for The New York TimesJoshua Castille, who plays a student named Ernst, said he and other deaf cast members tried to better understand the role of music in the play by gathering around portable speakers in a shared apartment \u201cto feel the moments.\u201d He said similar senses were used in the staging; for example, he said, in one scene a group of deaf actors gathers around a piano, feeling its vibration and using that as a cue to emerge from a crouch.It is not just movement and sound that need to be coordinated. Language, too, proved challenging, because the show unfolds not only in English, but also in American Sign Language, and the creative team, including three A.S.L. masters, an A.S.L. consultant and a deaf associate choreographer, Alexandria Wailes, was determined that the signing mirror the spoken English in timing, meaning and, to the extent possible, style.\u201cThe big challenge is that A.S.L. is not a very abstract language \u2014 it\u2019s more concrete, it\u2019s visual and spatial,\u201d said Shoshannah Stern, one of the A.S.L. masters. Noting that the show\u2019s lyrics are poetic and metaphor laden (a sample lyric, alluding to adolescent sexual behavior: \u201cMares will neigh with stallions that they mate/Foals they\u2019ve borne/And all shall know the wonder of purple summer\u201d), she said the sign language team had tried to create \u201cthe equivalent visual landscape\u201d while still being clear for deaf audience members.Clarity of communication has guided production decisions, affecting costumes (certain shades and patterns were rejected because they were thought to create \u201cvisual noise\u201d) and choreography (hand movement is primarily for language, not just aesthetics, and, for obvious reasons, signers need to face the audience). During rehearsals, the A.S.L. masters coached actors on expressiveness and negotiated with choreographers (for example, they insisted on limiting how far fingers could extend from the head when actors made the sign for \u201cdream\u201d) while interpreters relayed stage directions and translated conversations back and forth (\u201cPatrick, Daniel wants you to know there\u2019s no way you can hurt his ears by screaming into them\u201d).ImageIn \u201cAnd Then There Were None,\u201d Andy Mientus, a hearing actor, hands Daniel N. Durant, a deaf actor, a piece of paper to let him know that a sung lyric is ending.Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesAt the start of each show, actors use printed signs to inform the audience to turn off their cellphones, and to point out emergency exits. During the show, when two deaf actors are signing (and there is no sound) or two hearing actors are speaking (and there are no signs), supertitles are employed, projected either onto a chalkboard or the back wall of the stage. At many performances, deaf members of the audience can be seen applauding by raising their hands and twisting their wrists.The revival\u2019s cast includes the nation\u2019s best-known deaf actress \u2014 Marlee Matlin, who won an Academy Award in 1987 for \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d \u2014 and its A.S.L. consultant is a matriarch of contemporary American deaf theater: Linda Bove, who introduced a generation of children to sign language with her long-running role as Linda the Librarian on \u201cSesame Street.\u201dBut most of the cast members have never appeared on Broadway before, and several said they had never even seen a Broadway show; Ms. Matlin has been using Twitter to encourage other productions, including \u201cHamilton\u201d and this fall\u2019s \u201cMisery,\u201d to host interpreted performances that the \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d cast might attend.Like Ms. Manheim, who learned A.S.L. to satisfy a language requirement for college after failing French and Spanish, some of the other hearing members of the cast knew sign language already \u2014 most strikingly Austin P. McKenzie, who learned it as a counselor at a summer camp for children and adults with special needs, and who pulls off the complicated feat of singing and signing simultaneously in the show\u2019s lead role, Melchior.But many of the hearing actors knew no sign language, and many of the deaf actors had no relationship with music.\u201cWhen I got the role in a musical, I imagined myself not even being able to do this \u2014 I hadn\u2019t any prior experience with music,\u201d said Mr. Durant, who plays the troubled adolescent Moritz.\u201cIt was not smooth sailing initially,\u201d he added. \u201cIt took practice and rehearsal. And I\u2019ve learned so much more about music and rhythm and timing, and feeling the power of expressing yourself, and I love it.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/theater/review-spring-awakening-by-deaf-west-theater-brings-a-new-sensation-to-broadway.html", "headline": "Review: \u2018Spring Awakening\u2019 by Deaf West Theater Brings a New Sensation to Broadway", "date": "2015-09-28T02:00:07+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "One of the great musicals of the last decade was born anew on Sunday, when the thrillingly inventive Deaf West Theater production of \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d opened on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theater.

In this production, directed with remarkable finesse by Michael Arden (who starred in the same company\u2019s \u201cBig River,\u201d seen on Broadway in 2003), the primary roles are divided among deaf and hearing actors, with the deaf performers\u2019 songs and some of their dialogue being delivered by actors who double the roles.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/2:12-0:00transcriptIn Performance | \u2018Spring Awakening\u2019Katie Boeck, left, and Sandra Mae Frank perform \u201cMama Who Bore Me\u201d from Deaf West Theater\u2019s Broadway production of \u201cSpring Awakening.\u201dNA{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"@id\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/theater/100000003893735/in-performance-spring-awakening.html\",\"description\":\"Katie Boeck, left, and Sandra Mae Frank perform \u201cMama Who Bore Me\u201d from Deaf West Theater\u2019s Broadway production of \u201cSpring Awakening.\u201d\",\"url\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/theater/100000003893735/in-performance-spring-awakening.html\",\"name\":\"In Performance | \u2018Spring Awakening\u2019\",\"thumbnailUrl\":[\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/05/multimedia/in-performance-boeck/in-performance-boeck-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg\",\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/05/multimedia/in-performance-boeck/in-performance-boeck-superJumbo.jpg\",\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/05/multimedia/in-performance-boeck/in-performance-boeck-square640.jpg\"],\"embedUrl\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/players/offsite/index.html?videoId=100000003893735\",\"uploadDate\":\"2015-09-10T13:47:12.000Z\",\"transcript\":\"NA\",\"duration\":\"PT2M12S\"}Katie Boeck, left, and Sandra Mae Frank perform \u201cMama Who Bore Me\u201d from Deaf West Theater\u2019s Broadway production of \u201cSpring Awakening.\u201dSo, for example, the young female protagonist, Wendla Bergmann, is played by the deaf Sandra Mae Frank, who uses sign language to deliver her lines; her singing and spoken dialogue comes from Katie Boeck, who shadows her onstage, often strumming a guitar. A similar approach is used for the character of Moritz Stiefel, portrayed by Daniel N. Durant (deaf) and Alex Boniello (hearing). By dressing Ms. Boeck and Mr. Boniello in casual contemporary attire, Mr. Arden sets up a nifty visual echo of the contrast between the show\u2019s period setting and Mr. Sheik\u2019s surging pop and rock music.The other principal male role, Moritz\u2019s good friend Melchior Gabor, is played by the hearing actor Austin P. McKenzie, who nevertheless, like many in the cast, signs his dialogue and songs. And some of the dialogue is only signed, in which case the \u201ctranslations\u201d appear scrawled on a blackboard, for those who don\u2019t understand American Sign Language.True, it may take a few minutes to process the process, as it were. A mild case of sensory overload may have you reeling in the opening minutes, as you adjust to the necessity of taking it all in, and figuring out where to focus your concentration at any given moment.But a heady dose of sensory overload is what the best musicals deliver anyway; that\u2019s why people become obsessed with them. Here it\u2019s just different elements that contribute to the sensation. And it doesn\u2019t take much time before you move beyond the mechanics and fall into the dark flow of Wedekind\u2019s tale of sexual exploration, and the conflict between youthful rebellion and a repressive social order.ImageA scene from Deaf West Theater's production of \"Spring Awakening.\"Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesMr. Arden\u2019s cast also includes a few notable names: the Oscar winner Marlee Matlin and Camryn Manheim share the half-dozen adult female roles, and Patrick Page portrays many of the stern male authority figures, alongside Russell Harvard. All are terrific: Ms. Manheim excels in particular as the flustered mother of Wendla, who in the play\u2019s opening scene evades her adolescent daughter\u2019s innocent question about where babies come from, telling her only that for a woman to bear a child she \u201cmust \u2026 in her own personal way, she must \u2026 love her husband. As only she can love him.\u201dThis less than illuminating explanation sets in motion the tragedy that unfolds \u2014 or rather one of them. \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d does not present a comforting portrait of the transition from adolescence to adulthood; two of its three central characters don\u2019t survive. But the musical\u2019s tone is anything but dour: Mr. Sheik\u2019s guitar- and piano-driven score, nimbly played by a four-piece band embedded in the simple set (abetted by Ms. Boeck, Mr. Boniello and a few other members of the cast), alternates between high-energy songs in which the boys in Moritz\u2019s and Melchior\u2019s class act out their boiling frustrations, and haunting ballads (such as the lovely opening song, Wendla\u2019s \u201cMama Who Bore Me\u201d).Fine though the adult actors are \u2014 the apparently ageless Ms. Matlin is a graceful presence, particularly as Melchior\u2019s sympathetic mother \u2014 it\u2019s the three central characters who truly captivate. The inchoate sexual yearnings heating up inside Wendla (a pre-\u201cGlee\u201d Lea Michele in the original) are movingly depicted by the dark-eyed Ms. Frank, both through the urgent movements of her signing and her expressive face, in which we can read the bright hunger for experience \u2014 and the embarrassment of ignorance. Ms. Boeck sings with a plaintive passion that dovetails perfectly with Ms. Frank\u2019s performance.As Moritz, whose problems are as much educational as sexual, Mr. Durant exudes a boyish sense of melodramatic frustration; his brutish father will not countenance anything less than accomplishment, and Moritz\u2019s struggles at school are met with a lack of sympathy that shrivels his vulnerable soul.ImageKatie Boeck, left, as the voice of Wendla, and Sandra Mae Frank as Wendla in the musical.Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesAnd as Melchior, Moritz\u2019s tutor in the ways of sex, the handsome Mr. McKenzie gives an impassioned performance that grows in emotional intensity as the musical moves toward its dark ending. He movingly suggests that Melchior\u2019s affection for Wendla may have begun as a burning teenage crush but is quickly maturing into something deeper.Mr. Arden\u2019s production, with its stark set and spiffy (mostly) period costumes, both by Dane Laffrey, doesn\u2019t depart radically from the original, directed by Michael Mayer. In fact, the use of sign language, when it is entwined with the high-energy choreography by Spencer Liff, is intriguingly reminiscent of Bill T. Jones\u2019s superb work the first time around.In a program note, Mr. Arden compares the banning of Wedekind\u2019s controversial play to the earlier suppression of sign language at a Milan conference on the education of the deaf, in favor of an insistence on \u201coralism\u201d (lip-reading, primarily). It\u2019s an interesting point of connection, and one might also imagine that deaf actors (and viewers) could identify intuitively with the principal characters\u2019 disorienting sense of alienation from the dominant culture.But I hesitate to impose any new meanings on a work that doesn\u2019t need them to move us, or to imply that this \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d would only appeal to those with a particular interest in making more cultural space for people with disabilities. (Incidentally, the cast also includes an actor in a wheelchair \u2014 a detail I so easily assimilated that I almost forgot to mention it.) Deaf actors may not have the same tools that most actors do, but the gifted men and women in this splendid production achieve the same ideal ends, lighting up the lives of their characters from within, even when the light only reveals the darkness of their confusion, frustration and despair."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/nyregion/a-deaf-dancer-from-africa-makes-a-new-life-in-new-york.html", "headline": "A Deaf Dancer From Africa Makes a New Life in New York", "date": "2015-08-21T16:48:05+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Growing up in the small country of Burkina Faso in West Africa, Houzaifa Konditamd\u00e9 could not hear.

When he was 16, a friend, Daouda Derra, taught him traditional African dancing, and Mr. Konditamd\u00e9 took to it right away.\u201cI felt it in my soul,\u201d he said recently, communicating in sign language.Last year, Mr. Konditamd\u00e9, 22, left Burkina Faso and moved to the Bronx.

But \u201cThe Tribe\u201d is in so many ways a special case: a crime drama about a teenage \u201cdeaf mafia\u201d in which the only words used are sign language. As conceived, written and directed by Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy, the movie tells its story of violence and love through visuals alone, withholding translations of the nonprofessional actors\u2019 passionate signing.Even Mr. Slaboshpytskiy, 40, wondered whether his artistic gamble would work.\u201cOf course I was not sure when I start this film,\u201d he said in a recent Skype conversation in English from Ukraine. \u201cI thought it was a very brave and very pretentious idea. And nobody knew who I was!\u201dNow more people will know Mr. Slaboshpytskiy\u2019s formidable name (pronounced slaw-bosh-PEETZ-kee): \u201cThe Tribe\u201d begins a theatrical run on Wednesday in New York before its gradual release in theaters across the country. At festivals, his highly unusual debut feature has been a must-see, sweeping up prizes in the Critics\u2019 Week competition last year in Cannes before going on to awards at AFI Fest, Sundance, the Toronto International Deaf Film and Arts Festival and elsewhere. (When it was passed over as Ukraine\u2019s candidate for the Oscar for best foreign-language film, a subsequent controversy led to an effort to change the country\u2019s selection process.)\u201c\u00a0\u2018The Tribe\u2019 uses its absence of spoken words to completely rethink how a film communicates, to startling effect,\u201d Jonathan Romney, a member of the 2014 Critics\u2019 Week jury, wrote in The Guardian. He praised Mr. Slaboshpytskiy\u2019s ability to combine \u201cbrute realism, dry comedy and a potent streak of eroticism.\u201dThe silence of \u201cThe Tribe\u201d begins in earnest with an eerily quiet outdoor assembly at a grim boarding school for the deaf on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. Soon we are immersed in a world of brutality, starting with the initiation of a new student (Grigoriy Fesenko) into the school\u2019s gang. Little is learned by these pupils beyond brutal criminal endeavors. Working as a pimp, Mr. Fesenko\u2019s character goes against the group\u2019s code by falling for a prostitute (Yana Novikova) whose services he has been selling to truck drivers.ImagePunishment for the protagonist (Grigoriy Fesenko).Credit...Drafthouse FilmsDespite the absence of subtitles, the characters\u2019 actions and emotions are vividly clear. The physicality of the sign language gives the drama a bracing directness as tensions rise or moods fade.Mr. Slaboshpytskiy has said that potent visual storytelling was his prime goal in deciding to film a movie without voices or subtitles. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make a movie for deaf people or about deaf people,\u201d he said in an interview last year in Cannes. \u201cMy goal was to create a contemporary silent movie. I was interested in that stylization.\u201dThe story, set in the present day, is observed in extended takes with the rundown school and environs as a backdrop. The sound effects are subtly calibrated, allowing us to hear taps and other noises of signing. \u201cIt helps to push the viewer deeper into the story, into the film,\u201d he said. \u201cThe viewer becomes a member of the tribe.\u201dThe idea arose from research and years of observation by Mr. Slaboshpytskiy, who attended a school across the street from one for deaf students and shot the film in 2013 and 2014 in the district where he grew up outside the capital. \u201cFrom my childhood, I knew this region perfectly,\u201d he recalled at Cannes. \u201cI know all the corners, all the ways. As a child, I even knew where to hide myself to smoke a cigarette.\u201dA movie fan from a young age, he recalls watching French action films starring Alain Delon, Bollywood movies and in particular the American political thriller \u201cThree Days of the Condor,\u201d which he said he saw 30 or 40 times.Mr. Slaboshpytskiy, who earlier drew notice for short films screened at the Locarno and Berlin festivals, including a dry run for \u201cThe Tribe\u201d titled \u201cDeafness,\u201d is enough of a cinephile now to poke fun at his own techniques. \u201cAbout some art films, there is a joke: If you don\u2019t know how to do a film, you just do long shots,\u201d he said.ImageMr. Slaboshpytskiy with Rosa Babiy, left, and Yana Novikova.Credit...Drafthouse FilmsAlamo Drafthouse Films picked up the film at Cannes last year, bidding before it took prizes and agreeing not to add subtitles. \u201cIt\u2019s structured so well narratively that you don\u2019t need to rely on the language \u2014 that\u2019s what makes it unique,\u201d Tim League, Alamo\u2019s founder and chief executive, said in an interview. The company is planning special screenings for deaf moviegoers and is considering releasing the film\u2019s script, which includes the signed dialogue, as a bonus after the theatrical run.Ms. Novikova, who like other cast members communicated with Mr. Slaboshpytskiy through a sign-language interpreter, applauded the decision not to use subtitles.\u201cEverything in the film is constructed on emotions: Pleasure, anger, disappointment, sympathy are transmitted only through gestures and not by relying on subtitles or voice-overs,\u201d she said in an email message translated by a publicist. \u201cThe movie is universally clear to understand, for any country of the world.\u201dMr. Slaboshpytskiy\u2019s approach does have some precedents. Valery Todorovsky\u2019s \u201cThe Land of the Deaf\u201d (1998) centered on a deaf criminal milieu in Moscow; Frederick Wiseman\u2019s 1986 documentary \u201cDeaf\u201d also withheld subtitles for sign language. \u201cHarmony Lessons,\u201d a 2013 Kazakh film, is set in a similarly desolate boarding school of hard knocks in the post-Soviet era.Claire Shaw, a British scholar who writes about the ways that deaf people constructed identities in Soviet and post-Soviet society, said by email that Mr. Slaboshpytskiy\u2019s rendering is grounded in reality. \u201cThe phenomena it depicts do have their basis in historical fact,\u201d she said, citing a criminal organization of deaf people that was active in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s.Mr. Slaboshpytskiy will delve into another subculture for his next feature, which he plans to begin shooting in December. This neo-noir film, for now titled \u201cLuxembourg,\u201d will be set in today\u2019s so-called Chernobyl exclusion zone, which some inhabitants have refused to vacate since the meltdown at the nuclear plant there in 1986. He will draw on his experience visiting the area while working for a government ministry in the late 1990s.\u201cI am a member of the Chernobyl tribe,\u201d he said with a smile."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/nyregion/on-the-upper-east-side-silent-prayers-to-save-a-sanctuary-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "On the Upper East Side, Silent Prayers to Save a Sanctuary for the Deaf", "date": "2014-11-28T20:20:56+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "The choir members filed up to the altar in robes the color of the red roses of Saint Elizabeth, the patron saint of their beloved church.

Patrick McCahill saying and signing Mass at the Church of St. Elizabeth of Hungary.Credit...Emma Cott/The New York TimesThe church has become a haven to nearly 500 deaf New Yorkers, who not only pray there, but also come through the week to study religion, meet with clergy members and socialize. That era is about to end. On Nov. 2, the Archdiocese of New York announced that St. Elizabeth\u2019s would be among 31 churches closing for regular use by next August, part of a sweeping series of parish mergers and closings.The archdiocese says the closings are propelled by financial concerns, dwindling church attendance and a shortage of clergymen. But at St. Elizabeth\u2019s, the news came as a particular shock, because many parishioners, and the pastor, had believed that the church\u2019s special status as a sanctuary for the deaf would protect it.Msgr. Patrick McCahill, 71, has guided the church since Cardinal Cooke\u2019s designation and is the only priest fluent in American Sign Language who is left in the archdiocese, which stretches from the Catskills to Staten Island. He has officiated over countless baptisms, confirmations and weddings in A.S.L. and in the process has become the quiet spiritual leader of much of the practicing Catholic deaf community in New York.Though the church knew as early as last April that an advisory panel had recommended it for closing, Father McCahill, who is hearing, decided to not make a fuss, quietly trusting that the archdiocese would realize that the deaf community and St. Elizabeth\u2019s parish had fused together in a rare and special way, he said. There are about 240 hearing parishioners at the church. Despite their small numbers, they provide most of the financial support for the church, saying its work with the deaf community is part of what makes it vital.ImageThe congregation at St. Elizabeth\u2019s signing during Mass.Credit...Emma Cott/The New York TimesFather McCahill now considers his decision na\u00efve and says he believes that the archdiocese must have inadvertently overlooked the deaf Catholics in the complexity of deciding the fate of hundreds of parishes.\u201cI can\u2019t understand why it can\u2019t stay open and independent,\u201d he said after the closing was announced. After all, he said, the parish is financially sound and the church building is in good condition.\u201cI understand that the archdiocese has problems, but you are not going to solve those problems by going against your basic instincts of serving people,\u201d he said. His role now, he said, is to remind people: \u201cPlease, don\u2019t let these people, who are marginalized in so many ways by society, be marginalized by the church.\u201dThe unassuming brick church, which was founded by immigrants from Slovakia in the late 19th century, sits on a tree-lined block of small apartment buildings and brownstones in the heart of the wealthy Upper East Side. Inside, a steep staircase leads to a small, old-fashioned sanctuary, with plaster walls painted to look like stone, a midnight-blue ceiling adorned with gold stars, and stained-glass windows that never glow because neighboring buildings block them.ImageThe chorus signing the Lord\u2019s Prayer.Credit...Emma Cott/The New York TimesBut far from being a drawback, the sanctuary\u2019s size is a boon for the deaf, permitting them to easily see Father McCahill as he signs and speaks the Mass. The deaf travel from across the city and Westchester County to services held on the first and third Sundays of each month, often arriving in the morning and staying until 6 p.m. During the week, there are social gatherings and a Tuesday club for older deaf people, who spend hours in the church\u2019s simple social hall, playing bingo and catching up.\u201cMany of us are from different communities, Staten Island, Brooklyn, Westchester,\u201d Margaret Arnold, a deaf actress who is in the choir, said as Father McCahill interpreted. \u201cWe come here. This is the only place we can get together. At home, with their families, sometimes they don\u2019t feel close to them. Here, they do feel close.\u201dAs the Mass ended on Nov. 16, Evelis Cruz, the choir director, stood before the congregation in her red robes to sign a solo. Her 13-year-old son, Tyler, played a simple beat on a drum to accompany her, creating vibrations that even the deaf could feel. She swung her hair and stepped from side to side while signing a hymn called \u201cWe Are Your Family.\u201dThe congregants clapped along, or shook their palms high in the air, a sign-language form of applause.ImageThe church, on East 83rd Street.Credit...Nicole Bengiveno/The New York TimesThrough the Mass, people kept trickling into the church. By the time an annual Thanksgiving celebration began in the downstairs social hall about 3:15 p.m., roughly 100 people had gathered amid long tables, including some hearing friends and family.Hands flew as people rushed to catch up with old friends, gossip and exchange what information they had about what would happen to their community if their church closed. There were classmates from New York\u2019s schools for the deaf, couples who had married at the church, and families deaf for generations.The decision to close St. Elizabeth\u2019s and the 30 other churches came after years of discussion among leaders of the archdiocese. About 15 months ago, the archdiocese asked parishioners to weigh in and asked them to hold meetings with nearby churches about whether their parishes should merge, cooperate or close.Though the archdiocese made much about the bottom-up nature of the process, in the end, suggestions from parish committees were often overruled. St. Elizabeth\u2019s and a nearby parish, St. Stephen of Hungary, are merging with St. Monica\u2019s on East 79th Street, a move that most representatives from the parishes had opposed.ImageFather\u00a0McCahill at the entrance to the church, which will close for good next August.Credit...Nicole Bengiveno/The New York TimesThe archdiocese has not yet spoken with the clergy or parishioners at St. Elizabeth\u2019s about what will happen to the deaf community. The parishioners have been assuming they will move to St. Monica\u2019s, even though Father McCahill complains that the church, with its cathedral-size sanctuary and lack of a handicapped-accessible social hall, is inappropriate.The spokesman for the archdiocese, Joseph Zwilling, said on Nov. 19 that such thinking was \u201ca misconception.\u201dThe deaf will not be able to stay at St. Elizabeth\u2019s, he said, but \u201cfinding another location that can be their new home is very doable once we get a good handle on what their needs are and what they would be looking for.\u201dTo that, Father McCahill has a simple response: Why not let the deaf parishioners stay where they are? At St. Elizabeth\u2019s, he noted, the deaf feel at home, a sense that could be lost if they were just one of many groups at a church. \u201cIt\u2019s theirs, it\u2019s not mine,\u201d he said of the parish.That Sunday, he stood by and watched as the deaf parishioners cleared away their Thanksgiving buffet and took to a small auditorium stage to begin the highlight of the party: a laughter-filled turkey raffle. Holding up fingers and shouting the numbers, they finally called a lucky winner, who ran up to the stage and hoisted the frozen bird over her head.

With ambassadors like Ms. Callis, \u201cpeople see it, and it\u2019s a little\n                                        bit more front and center,\u201d he added.\n                                    Ms. Callis was born into a deaf family, and signing was her first language; not until she began preschool did she begin to adopt English. She grew up interpreting for her mother and three deaf siblings, but decided\n                                        to become an interpreter only eight years ago. To that end, Ms. Callis founded an interpreting company of her own, LC Interpreting Services, and also freelances through other\n                                        agencies. \n                                    Brigid Cahalan, who oversees outreach services at the library, said the initial tours received enough interest that she decided to offer them regularly this past spring. The library also plans to offer more events dedicated\n                                        to the deaf, like a series of talks with deaf authors, and to provide more interpreting and closed-captioning at other events.\n                                    When she looked for interpreters for the tours, she was surprised and pleased to see that Ms. Callis had signed up for every single slot.\n                                    \u201cObviously, there was an eagerness here, so I was happy,\u201d Ms. Cahalan added.\n                                    Eagerness may be an understatement, though Ms. Callis said her efforts have been stymied so far by the twin roadblocks of budget difficulties and indifference.\n                                    Advocates for the deaf have long struggled with a lack of awareness about deafness, said Jeffrey Wax, the director of the emotional health program at the Center for Hearing and Communication. Getting interpreters can\n                                        be costly and time-consuming, he said, and it can be hard to gauge how often an interpreter will be needed, leading many institutions to engage interpreters on an ad hoc basis instead of hiring one full time.\n                                    Ms. Callis says American Sign Language is often mistakenly characterized as a foreign language. It is, she said, merely an alternate way of communicating. But it is also not an exact simulation of English; in part because\n                                        the deaf do not hear inflections, ambient conversation and noise, idioms and jokes are often different in sign language.\n                                    Though many found her interpreting style during Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s news conferences amusingly exaggerated, Ms. Callis said that she was simply reflecting the gravity of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s delivery.\n                                    \u201cPeople truly have a hard time wrapping their heads around it, and that\u2019s when the deaf community suffers,\u201d she said, leaning forward and opening her eyes wider as if to underscore her point. \u201cPeople\n                                        just don\u2019t know. Look how far we came with gay rights \u2014 but then we can\u2019t get access for deaf people!\u201d\n                                    \u201cIt\u2019s 2013,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d\n                                    \n                                        Correction: August 30, 2013 The City Room column on Monday about Lydia Callis, a sign-language interpreter for Mayor Michael R.

Especially since it appears that there are people making decisions at the I.R.S. who have the intelligence of a wet Frisbee.But, so far, the Congressional hearings of outrage have been even less sympathetic. Perhaps you didn\u2019t have time to spend much of your Friday watching the House Ways and Means Committee grill Steven Miller, the newly axed I.R.S. head, about the agency\u2019s targeting of groups with names like \u201cTea Party\u201d for unwelcome in-depth attention.Let me summarize: Committee Chairman Dave Camp: Thank you all for coming here today. Our topic is abuses in the Internal Revenue Service, an entity that I believe is about the size of China, with long, spiky tentacles that reach out and squash all the hopes and dreams of the American people. My first question, Mr. Miller, is whether your agency is so enormous and evil that it will one day destroy the nation as we know it, or whether it already has, and this committee is actually just sitting on the scattered shards and rubble of what once was a great republic.Steven Miller: Thank you for inviting me here today. I would like to begin by apologizing for mistakes that have been made. Now I am prepared to begin answering your questions, and then gradually fade into sullen exhaustion.Sander Levin, Ranking Democrat: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for organizing this bipartisan outpouring of rage. I would like to begin by welcoming Inspector General J. Russell George, and asking him to repeat his conclusion that none of the bad things we\u2019re discussing were the result of partisan pressure. Possibly he could say that twice. Then I would like to ask him to confirm that he was appointed by George W. Bush. And then to point out that the guy who was in charge of the I.R.S. when all this happened was also appointed by George W. Bush. Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California: Mr. Miller, how would you like it if we were to subpoena your e-mails and phone calls and records of anyone you\u2019ve met with over the last four years? Also, have you ever had any contact with the Obama re-election campaign? ImageGail CollinsCredit...Earl Wilson/The New York TimesMr. Miller: I would just like to say in my defense that the I.R.S. provided horrible customer service.Representative Dave Reichert, Republican of Washington: What the I.R.S. did was inexcusable. Also, I want to register my strong protests about the way Mr. Miller keeps interrupting me while I am demanding that he answer my questions.And then everybody went home for the weekend.What are we going to do about the I.R.S.? Some of its workers made wildly inappropriate judgments and some of its top brass appears to have the spunk of a pillow. Congress is demanding that heads roll, but the inspector general says that, so far, there\u2019s no evidence of political pressure, just ineptitude. There is literally only one person in the entire operation who\u2019s not covered by civil service, so I wouldn\u2019t expect a purge. Miller, in his testimony, said that, so far, one employee has been relocated in punishment for his or her role in the case. The American people cry out for blood and they get a transfer.But here\u2019s where the sympathy comes in. The I.R.S. employees were stuck with a pile of 70,000 applications for the tax-exempt status that\u2019s awarded to organizations engaged in social welfare issues. Recently, political groups have been gaming the system, announcing they\u2019re just do-gooders with a minor political sideline in order to qualify. When they succeed, they get to keep their donors secret. The rules for who qualifies are murky, and, according to Miller, only about 150 to 200 people were making the decisions about who got further scrutiny.Also, they were working at the Determinations Unit of the Rulings and Agreements Office of the Exempt Organizations Division of the Internal Revenue Service. Spending their lives trying to clarify the 501(c)(4) status. You try that for a while and see how you like it.If Congress wanted to help, the members could simplify the law so I.R.S. minions aren\u2019t trying to figure out which groups spend only 49 percent of their resources on politics as opposed to 51 percent.Or, they could give the I.R.S. more money to do the job it\u2019s stuck with now. The budget has been cut almost $1 billion over the last few years, while its duties have expanded. Next Friday, I.R.S. workers will enjoy the first of a series of unpaid furloughs thanks to that sequester.Or Congress could just keep holding committee hearings in hopes that investigators will finally discover that the I.R.S. offices in Cincinnati are actually controlled by a pack of left-wing operatives who are not only Obamaphiles but also vampires. Vampires who had no respect for the laws regarding 501(c)(4) status.

Designed by a deaf architect to fit the needs of the deaf, its units have video phones and lights that flash when the phone or the doorbell rings. Wiring in common areas pipes announcements made through loudspeakers into residents\u2019 hearing aids.The complex, meant to foster a sense of community among residents who use sign language to communicate and socialize, was the first of its kind in the Southwest. For the Arizona Department of Housing, which allocated federal money to help pay for it, it was a milestone, one that advocates for the disabled hoped would be a model for similar projects.Preference was given to deaf and hard-of-hearing applicants, who occupy 69 of the complex\u2019s 75 units. The arrangement seemed to make sense; the state and the project\u2019s developer were convinced that they stood on solid legal ground.But after an audit last year, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development began raising questions.The project, named Apache ASL Trails in a reference to American Sign Language, now finds itself in an unlikely spot, facing charges of discrimination for favoring deaf and hard-of-hearing people over others, disabled or not. The federal agency released its finding in January after examining marketing materials and the project\u2019s criteria for tenant selection, even though the developer assured it that the documents in question had been misinterpreted or were outdated.Last June, HUD drafted a compliance agreement limiting the number of units set aside for deaf residents, which seems to have only stoked the dispute. State officials said the agency at one point threatened to withhold money from the state if it did not continue with the plan. But the state housing director, Michael Trailor, did not back down, saying he had to \u201cstand up for the rights of disabled people.\u201dAdvocates for the disabled fear that the finding might complicate other projects in which federal money would be used to build housing for adults with special needs. Already, the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center, based in Phoenix, has scrapped plans to use federal grants to help pay for a development designed for autistic adults, opting instead to pursue private financing.Through combative legal correspondence and in emotional meetings, the parties in the Tempe project, working to negotiate a compromise, have argued over the meaning of the federal statute governing fair housing practices and the word \u201cdiscrimination\u201d as it applies to the deaf. John Trasvi\u00f1a, HUD\u2019s assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity, said in a statement that \u201cfederal law prohibits facilities that receive HUD funds from providing separate or different housing for one group of individuals with disabilities because this practice denies or limits access to housing for other individuals based on the types of disabilities they have.\u201d (The agency did not make Mr. Trasvi\u00f1a or other officials available for on-the-record interviews.)In interviews, Mr. Trailor and the developer, Erich Schwenker of Cardinal Capital Management, which is based in Milwaukee, said the units were advertised in publications that focused on the deaf population, but also in the state\u2019s largest newspaper and in a local magazine. \u201cOur intention has never been to exclude, but to make sure the units are utilized to the fullest extent possible, as the law requires,\u201d Mr. Schwenker said.The demands from HUD mobilized advocacy groups across the country. Last week, 75 of them signed a letter from the National Association of the Deaf to the federal housing secretary, Shaun Donovan, accusing HUD of \u201cforcing deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to only live according to an ideological vision of forced integration.\u201dIn an interview, the association\u2019s chief executive officer, Howard Rosenblum, said the approach \u201cignores the unique communication needs\u201d of the deaf, making them more isolated. Denise Resnik, a co-founder of the Southwest autism center, said the agency\u2019s attitude felt \u201clike reverse discrimination.\u201dBy Friday, HUD had scaled back its efforts. A spokesman said the agency had decided to \u201ctake a pause\u201d in the negotiations to give the state and the developer time to submit evidence demonstrating the housing needs of the deaf population to justify the use of federal money in the project.Jeff Rosen, the chairman of the National Council on Disability, which advises the federal government on disability policy, said these types of discussions could help the government better understand the challenges faced by groups of disabled people like the deaf, who do not often have the opportunity to live in a community that they feel is \u201cappropriate and fit for them.\u201d (The council has not taken an official position on the Apache ASL Trails case.)\u201cOur understanding of discrimination and disability policies is evolving,\u201d Mr. Rosen, who is deaf, said through a sign-language interpreter.\u201cIn the past, our interest was really more focused on providing basic access to opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re having a more involved conversation that includes living the way we choose. That\u2019s the type of evolution we\u2019re talking about, and it is not unique to deaf people.\u201dA report by the National Fair Housing Alliance last year ranked disability as by far the main source of housing discrimination complaints received by HUD, representing 54.9 percent of them in 2011.There have been no formal complaints filed against Apache ASL Trails, federal officials acknowledged. The agency learned of the potential irregularities during an audit last year of Arizona\u2019s use of HOME grants, which are given to state and local governments to create affordable housing for low-income families. It is the state\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the grants comply with federal law. Agency officials said that other housing developments offering accommodations for the deaf had been partly paid for with HUD grants, but gave no overwhelming preference to deaf tenants or did not exclude other groups in their advertising. Tanya Towers in Manhattan is the only complex among the handful of examples given by HUD that currently houses only deaf and hard-of-hearing people, although others can apply, federal officials said.Mr. Trasvi\u00f1a said no one living at Apache ASL Trails would be displaced. The compliance agreement with HUD would limit the number of units set aside for tenants who are hearing-impaired or in wheelchairs to roughly 19, or 25 percent of its 75 units.The dispute over the agreement has consumed many hours for lawyers on both sides. Mr. Schwenker, the developer, said the agency cobbled together sections of a Web site for a group of hearing-impaired senior citizens to justify its claim that marketing for the units was exclusionary. Agency officials did not disclose which promotional materials they specifically took issue with, citing the continuing negotiations. Apache ASL Trails was built near the light-rail line that links Tempe to Phoenix and Mesa. Its resident manager, Linda Russell, is deaf; through an interpreter, she said she communicated with residents who do not know sign language through notes scribbled on paper or on the white board she keeps in her office.A nonprofit organization offering sign-language interpretation and other services has an office in the complex. Weekly workshops \u2014 both spoken and with simultaneous sign-language translation \u2014 are held in its lobby.\u201cA lot of the people who live here, we share common language; we\u2019re able to socialize,\u201d Mary Susan Case, 72, who was born deaf to a hearing family, said through an interpreter. \u201cI\u2019m not lonely anymore.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/arts/music/sign-language-interpreters-bring-live-music-to-the-deaf.html", "headline": "For Deaf and Hard of Hearing, the Joy of Live Music", "date": "2013-03-03T02:35:01+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "On the last night of the 2012 Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago, the sun set over a crowd of thousands who had stood for hours waiting to see Jack White, the headliner. A figure strode onto the stage, setting off a cascade of cheers. But it was not Jack White, the singer-guitarist, it was Barbie Parker, the festival\u2019s lead sign language interpreter. Ms. Parker, a Texas native, and members of her Austin-based company, LotuSIGN, had interpreted more than 20 bands\u2019 sets for deaf and hard of hearing festival attendees that weekend. As evidenced by the positive reception she received, her interpretations had won over a good part of the hearing audience as well.At live music shows, Ms. Parker, 45, does not just sign lyrics \u2014 she communicates the entire musical experience. She mouths the words. She plays air guitar and air drums. She jams along with the bands.\u201cMusic is such a large part of who I am,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be able to open up that experience.\u201dMs. Parker was bored in her accounting job and had two young children when she enrolled in her first formal American Sign Language class at San Antonio College about 20 years ago. She became fascinated with interpretation after reading a book about it at her local library and, in a chance encounter just hours after reading it, met the sister of a friend who happened to be an American Sign Language interpreter.Ms. Parker is now an integral part of Austin\u2019s deaf community. Her two adult sons are proficient in A.S.L., and her company has provided sign language interpretation at music festivals across the country for several years. Next week, she and other LotuSIGN interpreters will take the stage with artists at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin for the sixth year in a row.The number of deaf and hard of hearing music fans taking advantage of interpretation at free shows held at Auditorium Shores as part of SXSW has risen noticeably in the past few years, Frank Schaefer, the officer manager for the festival, said in an e-mail. The increase can be attributed, at least in part, to a growing number of interpreters who specialize in that kind of work.A good interpreter is adept at signing, but Ms. Parker also wants her team to impart the emotions and feelings music conveys. Lauren Kinast, 44, who lost her hearing gradually, attended a Rolling Stones concert signed by LotuSIGN interpreters. Ms. Kinast had listened to the Stones growing up, but when she saw Ms. Parker and a colleague interpret their music, she came away with a greater appreciation of the band. \u201cEverything made it different, better,\u201d Ms. Kinast typed in an interview. \u201cHaving the songs interpreted in my language, understanding the emotions behind it, the meaning behind it, and being a part of the concert experience just took my love for them several notches up.\u201dMs. Parker first gained recognition in the mid-2000s for interpreting music at the funeral of the parent of a well-known member of the deaf community in Austin. At one point during the service, she needed to sign an emotional musical performance.\u201cThe singer got inspired, so the interpreting had to get inspired,\u201d Ms. Parker said. The signing seemed to further stir the singer, which further moved Ms. Parker. \u201cThere was a kind of reverb,\u201d she said. \u201cThe deaf audience was just \u2014 I just saw these jaws drop open like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAfter that, she began receiving requests to interpret at weddings, children\u2019s recitals and, of course, live shows. In 2007, she started her own company, Alive Performance Interpreting, which in 2009 became LotuSIGN. \u201cThey\u2019re five-star interpreters,\u201d said Stacy Landry, the program manager for the local government\u2019s deaf and hard of hearing services in Travis County. (Ms. Parker has obvious clout in the field \u2014 her traditional interpreting services were used in January when she intepreted President Obama\u2019s Inaugural Address in Washington.)LotuSIGN interpreters specialize in analyzing lyrics for the artist\u2019s intent in a song. But sign language interpretation, no matter where it takes place, is about more than translating words into gestures and signs. The interpreter must communicate an overall experience by expressing the speaker\u2019s tone, the meaning behind phrases and idioms, and even if someone\u2019s cellphone interrupts an otherwise-silent lecture hall.One year, Ms. Parker interpreted at a Sheryl Crow concert held to celebrate of one of Lance Armstrong\u2019s Tour de France titles. He was asked to take over on the drums for one of Ms. Crow\u2019s songs. \u201cWell,\u201d Ms. Parker said, \u201che wasn\u2019t any good.\u201d Ms. Parker let the discomfort show on her face as she imitated Mr. Armstrong\u2019s uneven drumming. She nodded subtly to assure perplexed members of the deaf audience that she was indeed doing this on purpose. As the audience reacted, Ms. Parker saw a deaf man elbow the hearing man next to him and cringe. The hearing man nodded and made a similar pained face. \u201cThey had this shared experience,\u201d Ms. Parker said. The deaf man was truly part of the crowd.LotuSIGN is working to mentor others in the hope of expanding access to live events. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it without a lot of experience,\u201d Ms. Parker said. \u201cIt is the hardest work I have ever done.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/jobs/a-deaf-couple-realize-a-restaurant-dream.html", "headline": "Deaf, Determined and Sold on Mozzarella", "date": "2012-10-13T20:45:13+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "MY parents have owned restaurants in Hong Kong and San Francisco throughout my life. So it was reasonable that I dreamed of running my own someday. I wasn\u2019t going to let the fact that I was born deaf deter me from realizing that dream.My route to becoming a restaurateur was circuitous. Owning any restaurant is risky. It\u2019s even more treacherous in San Francisco, a foodie mecca where restaurants come and go faster than the fog rolls in and out. My husband, Russ Stein, is also deaf, and as deaf restaurateurs our goal could have been even more daunting. But we approached it systematically, with a vision to serve both the deaf and the hearing.My journey began in Hong Kong, where I was born in 1973. My brother, Joseph, is also deaf and my parents did not feel that Hong Kong accommodated deaf people adequately. We moved to the Bay Area when I was 7 and Joseph was 5 so we could attend the California School for the Deaf. My parents always emphasized that education would be even more important for us to make our way through life.Taking their cue, after high school I went to the Rochester Institute of Technology; it has a good hospitality and tourism management department. After two years, I transferred to Gallaudet University for deaf and hard-of-hearing students; Joseph was already enrolled there. It didn\u2019t have a hospitality management major so I majored in business administration, even though I hated numbers.ImageRuss and Melody Stein, who are deaf, own Mozzeria, a restaurant in San Francisco. Workers use sign language, pen and paper, bulletin boards and the Web to communicate.Credit...Peter DaSilva for The New York TimesThat\u2019s where I met Russ. After he received his degree in business administration, we moved to San Francisco in 1995. I transferred to San Francisco State University, majoring in hospitality management and graduating in 1998.My personal goal was postponed when Russ was offered a job at the Communication Service for the Deaf in Sioux Falls, S.D. Though a detour from my dream, it was too good an opportunity for him to refuse. I also got a job there, in marketing. We stayed 10 years.Those years would serve us well when we returned to San Francisco and felt ready to open a restaurant. Russ agreed, only if it could be a pizzeria. Being from New York, he is a pizza fanatic. Mozzarella is his weakness. That\u2019s how Mozzeria was born. We opened last December in the Mission District.But the preparation started two years earlier. Immersing myself in Italian cooking, I went to Italy and took pizza- and pasta-making classes in Rome, Sorrento and Positano. I brought along my mother, who signs, to interpret for me.Back in San Francisco, Russ and I built a small wood-burning oven in our backyard and I practiced making pies. We decided on serving Neapolitan pizza; it felt more authentic to us. I developed our menu \u2014 including a pizza topped with roast duck and hoisin sauce, a gesture to my Chinese roots.ImageMelody Stein uses an iPad app to confirm reservations via a translation service.Credit...Peter DaSilva for The New York TimesThe space we chose had been a restaurant previously, but it had not been accessible for people in wheelchairs. We made that accommodation right away; naturally I am a strong advocate of the Americans With Disabilities Act.There were little glitches from the outset. We encountered certain people who themselves would become speechless, as they had never met deaf people before, much less done business with them. We had to educate government and business reps that they had to arrange for American Sign Language interpreters to communicate with us. We became more used to writing notes back and forth and using the iPad.Almost everything in the restaurant was designed or built by deaf people, as is all the artwork on the walls. We hired deaf and A.S.L. signers. For many, working in a restaurant was a new experience. We learned a lot together and improvised over time. Everyone now carries paper and pen to communicate with hearing guests. Our kitchen has lots of bulletin boards for the staff to write on, to avoid any mistakes.THE rise of social media and new technology has been an unexpected boon for the deaf, making it much easier to communicate with hearing people \u2014 in ways like simple text messaging and video relay services. Twitter and Facebook put us on par with other restaurants.

But other devices can help, too, as audio technology adds new options to help people converse at a noisy restaurant, or talk quietly with a pharmacist at a crowded drugstore counter.Richard Einhorn, a composer who suddenly lost much of his hearing two years ago, relies on his hearing aid, of course, for general use. But when he is meeting friends at a busy coffee shop \u2014 where his hearing aid is not always good at distinguishing their voices amid the clatter \u2014 he removes it. He has a better solution.He pops on a pair of in-ear earphones and snaps a directional mike on his iPhone, which has an app to amplify and process sound.\u201cI put the iPhone on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cI point it at whoever\u2019s talking, and I can have conversations with them. Soon we forget the iPhone is sitting there.\u201d Mr. Einhorn\u2019s ad hoc solution to restaurant racket is a feasible one, said Jay T. Rubinstein, a professor of bioengineering and otolaryngology at the University of Washington.\u201cIt makes sense when you need to capture a speaker\u2019s voice in a noisy environment,\u201d he said. \u201cA system that gives you a high-quality directional mike and good earphones can help people hear in a complex setting.\u201dA new version of the directional microphone Mr. Einhorn uses, Blue Mikey, is available for $99.99. One app he uses is soundAMP R, which is $4.99. For earphones, he likes the in-ear Etymotic hf5, at $149. Every hearing situation has its own solution. When Mr. Einhorn leaves the restaurant and wants to make a cellphone call, he might switch from his iPhone setup to his hearing aid and a companion device worn around the neck that receives Bluetooth audio from the phone and transmits it to the hearing aid. ImageIn a noisy restaurant, earphones and an iPhone app that amplifies and processes sound help Richard Einhorn, a composer, converse with friends.Credit...Miranda EinhornOnce home, he might take advantage of a tiny, inexpensive component in his hearing aid called a telecoil, or t-coil, that can pick up sound directly from a simple wire loop that he\u2019s connected to his TV. As long as he sits within the periphery of this loop in his living room, the t-coil receives the transmission. \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear,\u201d he said of the broadcast.The loop comes from Contacta. It attaches to the TV audio output and can either run around the edges of the room or just be placed inside a mat that sits beneath a chair, or in a pad that tucks under a cushion.None of the various technologies he uses are perfect in all situations. \u201cIt takes time and practice to learn where they work well,\u201d he said, \u201cand to switch from one device to another.\u201dThe range of options Mr. Einhorn deploys for dealing with hearing loss is not unusual. \u201cThere are many combinations of technologies possible now for people who need hearing assistance,\u201d said Stephen P. Bowditch, an audiologist and faculty member at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.Before someone commits to a device, Mr. Bowditch advises a hearing test. \u201cEvery hearing loss is different, and we know in audiology that one size does not fit all,\u201d he said.MODERN digital hearing aids tend to be costly \u2014 they can run $6,800 a pair and more, and are rarely covered by insurance. But the t-coil, the tiny internal copper component in Mr. Einhorn\u2019s hearing aid, is gradually becoming an inexpensive way to broaden and refine the reach of hearing aids. These t-coils are now standard in most of the hearing aids that Mr. Bowditch installs. \u201cIf we can fit it in, we put it in,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether people use it is up to them.\u201d There may soon be many more spots to use a t-coil, as hearing loops gradually appear in an increasing number of public and private spaces, said David G. Myers, a professor of psychology at Hope College in Holland, Mich. Dr. Myers has long championed the use of hearing loop systems, in part through an informational Web site. Emcom Systems in Trenton is developing a small mat with a built-in hearing loop. The loop is connected to a microphone that can sit on counters at pharmacies or medical offices so that people standing on the mat can conduct a quiet, clear conversation with staff members, said Mark Zuckerman, director of marketing. The system will be on sale later this year for about $1,100.\u201cWe want to support crucial conversations in the daily lives of people\u201d who are hard of hearing, he said.

Freshness of vision is in all departments of life an aesthetic category not to be sneezed at.All of which is a necessarily elaborate way of saying that Brian Selznick\u2019s new book, \u201cWonderstruck\u201d \u2014 engrossing, intelligent, beautifully engineered and expertly told both in word and image \u2014 cannot entirely escape the force field or expectations set up by his 2008 Caldecott winner, \u201cThe Invention of Hugo Cabret.\u201d \u201cHugo Cabret\u201d was one of those rare books \u2014 Chris Van Allsburg\u2019s tale \u201cThe Polar Express\u201d is the last that comes to mind \u2014 that strike imaginations small and large with a force, like, well, thunder. Neither graphic novel nor illustrated book, its composite of storytelling forms seemed derived from the storyboards of some lost Czech genius of the silent film era rather than anything evident in other books. (Martin Scorsese has adapted it into a film to be released this fall.)Though not a sequel of matter, \u201cWonderstruck\u201d is very much a sequel of method, and a test of it. Can Selznick\u2019s black-and-white chiaroscuro spell-making be transported or extended beyond the European fin de si\u00e8cle setting that seemed essential in its first appearance?The material for this new book is, it seems, very deliberately wrenched at once into an entirely new and more American landscape. Ben, an adolescent boy growing up in \u201cGunflint Lake,\u201d Minn., in the 1970s has lost his loving mother in a car accident \u2014 his true father is unknown to him \u2014 and a second disaster (telephone, lightning) soon costs him his ability to hear. An obscure series of clues suggests that his father may live in New York, and Ben sets out in search of him. In the midst of the subdued narration of this sad story we are suddenly \u2014 with masterly abruptness, and a complete absence of explanation \u2014 thrown into a second tale, told entirely in black and white panels and far more melodramatically conveyed, of an unnamed deaf girl who in the 1920s runs away from her Hoboken home in search of a Broadway star. In a New York made more hallucinatory by its silence, she discovers the actress, and we are given a startling revelation about her identity. Then the two stories, Ben\u2019s flight to the city and the as-yet-unnamed girl\u2019s flight to safety 50 years earlier, slowly entangle and become one, and the mysteries of the two flights (his toward his father, hers toward him) resolve beautifully on the night of the New York City blackout in 1977 (which exists here, rather against the grain of history, as a peaceful, not to say pastoral, occasion). Throughout, Selz\u00adnick\u2019s eye for the details of New York\u2019s enchanted places \u2014 the dioramas at the American Museum of Natural History, Times Square in the 1920s and the too easily forgotten marvel of the City Panorama at the Queens Museum of Art \u2014 are pitch, or rather picture, perfect.There is so much to like and admire that the reader reluctantly confesses to what our children\u2019s teachers call, delicately, \u201csome problems\u201d with the story. The hero, Ben, seems rather routinely imagined: one of those isolated Fine Boys with a Disability who are the default heroes of too many children\u2019s books. The heroes and heroines of imaginative literature need not be tragically flawed, but they ought to be tarter, more capable of imperfection, than this. Even Ben\u2019s deafness seems oddly un-disabling. He manages the flight to New York, and then secrets himself into the Museum of Natural History with suspiciously little difficulty. The practicalities of his circumstances in New York are hard to imagine credibly, even on the somewhat dreamlike terms in which they are offered. That a deaf boy would run all the way to New York is the necessary premise \u2014 but surely his sleeping and sanitary arrangements could be explained with more clarity than Selznick provides. Selznick\u2019s style is so silent that it seems logical that it take in the mute world. But the concern with the deaf \u201cissues\u201d that fill the book, though in one way \u201cappropriate\u201d as those same teachers would say, feels at times too appropriate \u2014 uncomfortably pious, a medicinal outgrowth of the fable rather than essential to its magic.Yet whenever such doubts arise they are overcome, overwhelmed even, by the purity of Selznick\u2019s imagination. The moment, for instance, when the heroine is rescued by an at first enigmatic museum worker named Walter \u2014 yields an almost unbearable tenderness.In a long, gracious afterword, Selznick cites \u201cFrom the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\u201d among his sources and models, and promises references to that earlier classic about children fleeing to a New York museum buried throughout his book. (We\u2019re looking.) Though a lovely tribute, the juxtaposition of this book and that one is arresting, and instructive. Where that \u201960s classic, like so many of its kind and time, was lightly satirical and assumed an easy passage between the material of children\u2019s literature and that of grown-up affairs, books of equivalent ambition and point a half-century later are more purposefully enigmatic and drawn above all to sites of silent mystery like the Natural History museum, not only as it appears at night (as in the movies), but as it was in the past. Konigsburg\u2019s children, hiding in the Met, were practical people with practical problems, and the mystery that entices them is resolved, even debunked a little, at the end. They were being educated in the realities of life.For Selznick, as for Van Allsburg, or for that matter, Kate DiCamillo, the beauty of strangeness, more than its management, is the purpose of storytelling, and though some of their questions are answered, their mysteries remain intact. Selznick\u2019s gift is for the uncanny and the haunting, and his subject is not only the strange poetry of ordinary things but the poetry of things from another time: train stations, frozen museum dioramas and old bookstores. Small bells ring at midnight, and mute protagonists embrace in darkness.So, while the ostensible moral of \u201cWonderstruck\u201d is the entanglement of people, its real lesson is about memory. Beyond its honorable message about the dignity of deafness, it teaches a respect for the past and for the power of memory to make minds. In an age when mass entertainment inclines children toward movement and energy, and screens accustom their eyes to the sparkle of pixilated light, one of the tasks books have taken on is to teach them, and us, to value stillness. Mere nostalgia, maybe? Well, what is nostalgia, save the vernacular of memory, and so the place where reading starts?"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/travel/26diving-journeys.html", "headline": "Deaf Divers Sign in the Soundless Depths", "date": "2010-12-24T19:55:17+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "AFTER sunset one evening in August, Wendy Dannels prepared for the first night dive of her life off Moalboal, a resort town on the Philippine island of Cebu. She was on a 10-day diving trip on a boat called the Philippine Siren.Ms. Dannels was visibly anxious before her dive, fumbling with her gauges and checking and rechecking them. Soon, she disappeared into the murky depths for just under an hour.But after emerging, she was all smiles. She said she enjoyed the dive in the dark immensely, citing close encounters with crab and shrimp.\u201cMy favorite part is the sparkling lights at night, the phosphorescence,\u201d she said later through an interpreter. When you turn off your light at night and move your hand in the dark, she explained, the water shimmers with small, glowing bits of plankton. \u201cThe diving is a bit of an adventure,\u201d she added.Like about half of her shipmates, Ms. Dannels, 42, is deaf. She lost her hearing at 14 months when she contracted spinal meningitis. The diving trip was on her \u201cbucket list\u201d of things to do before she dies, she said. She found the tour on the Siren, a live-aboard ship, by searching the Internet for the terms \u201cdeaf\u201d and \u201csailing.\u201dHer day job is teaching engineering at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at the Rochester Institute of Technology.The company that runs the Siren, Worldwide Dive and Sail, has been organizing regular trips for deaf and hard of hearing divers since 2004; it\u2019s one of a handful of dive companies that offer specialty trips catering to divers with disabilities. The company typically runs one such trip a year, to diving destinations in places like Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. (Its next trip is scheduled for September 2011 in the Maldives.)The company\u2019s founder, Frank van der Linde, got the idea for the trips after working on the Thai island of Koh Tao with Naomi Hayim, a British dive instructor who is deaf. Both Mr. van der Linde and Ms. Hayim serve as instructors on the trips, on which they try to insure a balance between deaf customers and those with normal hearing.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be called the \u2018deaf boat\u2019 or whatever \u2014 it is just an extra service that we do,\u201d Mr. van der Linde said. \u201cYou need to take a bit more time in explaining, but you get so much more feedback out of it, nice feedback, and get satisfaction out of it.\u201dHaving started to teach himself sign language after meeting Ms. Hayim, Mr. van der Linde now tries to make sure all the guests interact with one another on the trips. Each member of the crew is given a sign language name on the first night, and the hearing guests are encouraged to pick up at least the basics of the sign-language alphabet.ImageWendy Dannels, right, who is deaf, chats via sign language with her shipmates before a dive.Credit...Alex Frew McMillan\u201cA lot of people are not comfortable with having conversations with deaf people because they never have before,\u201d Mr. van der Linde said. \u201cYou see it already after the first day \u2014 the ice is melted and people start to communicate more.\u201dThe first specialty trip, in 2004, almost met with disaster. That group, which included two deaf divers, as well as a paralyzed diver, was in the water at Richelieu Rock, a well-known dive site in the Andaman Sea off Thailand, when the tsunami struck.\u201cIt was like being in a washing machine,\u201d Mr. van der Linde recalled. \u201cWe went from 18 meters to 2 and back to 15 meters in less than 60 seconds. The whole dive took only 14 minutes.\u201d Luckily, all the divers got safely back onboard.On the Siren, each of the dive briefings is led by a guide using a large map; they are also encouraged to talk a little more slowly than usual, for easier lip-reading. And there\u2019s an interpreter who communicates the information by sign language to the deaf divers who sign.Of course, not all communication is based around the dives. Each evening, the interpreter tells the guests in sign language what each dish is for dinner and generally helps communicate between travelers with normal hearing and those who are hard of hearing. There\u2019s also sufficient lighting throughout the ship to allow the deaf clients to see signs or lip-read. Deaf guests also typically get a discount of 20 to 25 percent off the price of a trip since, Mr. van der Linde noted, many deaf people have lower-than-average incomes.The deaf divers say they appreciate being included in all the communication on the trip.\u201cWhen deaf people go diving in normal places, they normally are the only deaf person in the group, so they tend to struggle to understand what is happening around them,\u201d Ms. Hayim said. \u201cHere they feel very comfortable, and the communication is very natural. They feel safe and can be themselves.\u201dPaul Williams, an Australian, has been on three Worldwide Dive and Sail trips. A former dive instructor who is deaf himself, he has taught both deaf and hearing students and has traveled the globe to dive. Since he can lip-read and sign, he said he enjoys talking with both hearing and non-hearing guests on trips that bring the two together.\u201cIt\u2019s more fun with deaf people, and you can mix with the hearing people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with people who talk too fast, so with hearing people it is a bit difficult. Here they have a white board and map, so it\u2019s much better for the dive debrief.\u201dSince each country has its own sign language, which can be as distinct from one another as spoken languages, the trips cater to people who use both American Sign Language, spelled using one hand, and British Sign Language, which uses two. The trips have also attracted deaf divers from Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, the divers getting by with a mish-mash of different sign languages.Although communication on the surface may be a bit more complex for deaf divers, they actually have something of an advantage underwater, if they\u2019re able to use sign language. They can have long conversations; most divers with hearing are limited to a system of around 30 diving hand signals. Ms. Hayim said she often has to interrupt deaf divers chatting away underwater, to get them to focus on dive instructions.Another deaf diver on the Siren, Lesa McAbee-Harris, a postal clerk from Asheville, N.C., often travels with deaf friends and tries to include specialized diving trips whenever possible. She and her (hearing) husband, David Harris, have dived in the Gal\u00e1pagos and in Belize.\u201cHearing people often say I\u2019m lucky being able to communicate underwater,\u201d she said. \u201cWelcome to our silent world.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/us/23marsters.html", "headline": "James Marsters, Deaf Inventor, Dies at 85", "date": "2009-08-23T00:10:23+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Sign language, lip reading and speech training helped James Marsters get through college and dental school and made it possible for him to succeed as an orthodontist. He could communicate very well face to face.But for most of his first 40 years, the telephone was a barrier.\u201cAll of us in the family, whenever a call came for my dad,\u201d his son James Jr. said on Friday, \u201cwe picked up this handset attached to the phone so that we could listen in and relay to my father what the caller was saying. He would read our lips and then reply in his own voice.\u201d Dr. Marsters and two deaf colleagues broke that barrier for themselves and tens of thousands of other hearing-impaired people in 1964 when they converted an old, bulky, clacking Teletype machine into a device that could relay a typewritten conversation through a telephone line. It was the first example of what became commonly known as a TTY and is now, in a greatly updated and compact version, called a text telephone. Dr. Marsters died of natural causes at his home in Oakland, Calif., on July 28, his son said. He was 85. A mutual acquaintance, aware that two of his friends were thinking along the same lines, introduced Dr. Marsters to Robert H. Weitbrecht, a physicist at Stanford University, in 1964. Both were soon fiddling with the nearly obsolete Teletype machines cluttering Dr. Marsters\u2019s garage. Mr. Weitbrecht came up with the idea of using an acoustic coupler \u0097 now called a modem \u0097 to connect two of the Teletype machines. The coupler changed electrical signals coming from one Teletype machine into tones sent through a telephone wire; at the other end, the tones were changed back into electrical signals so that the message could be printed on the receiving machine. Another tinkerer, Andrew Saks, an electrical engineer and a grandson of the founder of Saks Fifth Avenue, was soon working in the garage as well. Dr. Marsters and Mr. Weitbrecht had gone to him for financing. With the intention of building a network of TTY users, the three men began collecting and reconditioning the Teletype machines that were being discarded by news services and companies like Western Union. They formed a company, the Applied Communications Corporation, to refurbish and donate TTYs. Dr. Marsters traveled around the country, educating the deaf community about the new technology, forming partnerships with other organizations and lobbying for support from government officials.There were only 18 TTYs in operation in 1966, Karen Peltz Strauss, the author of \u201cA New Civil Right: Telecommunications Equality for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Americans\u201d (Gallaudet University Press, 2006), said in a telephone interview on Thursday. By 2006, there were about 30,000 listings in the Blue Book, a national directory of TTY users. Pointing out that the Internet has since greatly reduced the need for text telephones, Ms. Peltz Strauss said, \u201cI would say that by the mid-1990s it had peaked at tens of thousands of people who had and used them regularly.\u201dDr. Marsters, she said, \u201cgot the ball rolling for future generations of people with hearing loss to achieve telecommunications equality.\u201dBeyond making their technological breakthrough and starting the network, Dr. Marsters and his partners, working with other leaders of the deaf community, played significant roles in reshaping government policy. When they introduced their device, the partners met strong resistance from AT&T, which then had virtual control over the nation\u2019s telephone system and prohibited direct connections to its network. In 1968, the Federal Communications Commission struck down AT&T\u2019s restrictive policy, saying it had no right to deny the connection to its network as long as there was no harm to its operations. In the 1970s, Dr. Marsters and Mr. Saks made arrangements with several local telephone companies in California to introduce relay services \u0097 technology that allowed deaf people to communicate with hearing people.\u201cDr. Marsters and his partners provided the forerunner of what is now a nationwide network of telecommunication relay services,\u201d Ms. Peltz Strauss said. \u201cThese services are now completely free to anybody who wants them because they are required by law under the Americans With Disabilities Act.\u201dJames Carlyle Marsters was born in Norwich, N.Y., on April 5, 1924, one of two sons of Guy and Anna Belle Marsters. His father was a pharmaceutical company executive. Besides his son James, Dr. Marsters is survived by another son, Guy; a daughter, Jean Marsters; and two grandchildren. His wife of 49 years, the former Alice Dorsey, died in 2003.In infancy, Jimmy Marsters lost his hearing to scarlet fever and measles. As a toddler, he received lip-reading and speech training. After graduating from the Wright Oral School for the Deaf in New York City in 1943, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry at Union College, in Schenectady, N.Y.For three years, Mr. Marsters worked in a necktie factory in New York while his applications to dental schools were repeatedly rejected. Eventually, the New York University College of Dentistryadmitted him, with the understanding that it would offer no special accommodations. He received his dental degree in 1952, then moved to California, where two years later he earned a master\u2019s degree in orthodontics at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Dr. Marsters opened his orthodontics practice in Pasadena, Calif., in 1954; he retired in 1990. Mr. Weitbrecht died in 1983, and Mr. Saks died in 1989. One day in May 1964, when both were at their homes in California, Dr. Marsters and Mr. Weitbrecht made the first TTY call on a traditional telephone line. Their communication was garbled at first. But after some adjustments were made, their typed words were clear and concise: \u201cAre you printing me now?\u201d Mr. Weitbrecht asked Dr. Marsters. \u201cLet\u2019s quit for now and gloat over the success.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/arts/04iht-idbriefs4A.16674913.html", "headline": "David Lodge's 'Deaf Sentence'", "date": "2008-10-04T05:00:00+0000", "source": "International Herald Tribune", "text": "Deaf Sentence By David Lodge. 294 pages. $25.95, Viking; \u00a317.99, Harvill Secker.\"Deafness is comic, as blindness is tragic.\" So claims Desmond Bates, the retired professor of linguistics who narrates David Lodge's 13th novel, \"Deaf Sentence.\" Bates certainly has the authority to make such an epigrammatic pronouncement ' for the last 20 years, he has been inexorably slipping into a state of \"high frequency deafness,\" which causes him to miss (among other things) consonants as he listens to others speak. The result is that his life is becoming one long conversational pratfall, in which the simplest statement can embroil the somewhat pompous academic in low farce.The biggest of these tumbles comes in the novel's opening chapter as Bates attends an art exhibition in the northern English city where he lives. While there, he fails to catch most of what is said to him by Alex Loom, a charming but unstable young American woman who is researching her dissertation at Bates's former university. After missing the appointment he never knew they'd made, Bates visits the attractive blonde's apartment, where she asks him to supervise her work on the linguistics of suicide notes. As an inducement, she secretly slips a pair of her underpants into the prevaricating professor's raincoat. Fortunately for Bates, he is able to hide their discovery from his wife, Fred (short for Winifred), an interior decorator who was once a student of Bates's.When he complains to Alex about her behavior, she offers to let him spank her. He refuses (though it's a close call), whereupon she asks him to write a \"pseudicide note,\" or fake suicide note, which she can then combine with actual notes as a way of testing the public's ability to identify the real thing. By the time Alex shows up unexpectedly at Fred's Boxing Day party, the novel seems ready to turn into a full-blown tale of closed-captioned fatal attraction.Lodge propels this story line along with writing that is consistently witty, reinforcing that earlier assertion about the comic potential of hearing impairment. \"One thing we deafies can do at a party is give people a few laughs with our mistakes,\" Bates maintains. He has a particular weakness for puns pertaining to his condition. \"If only I had heard what she was saying when we first met it would never have started,\" he laments about Alex. \"Deaf and the maiden, a dangerous combination.\" When he learns that she has defaced a library book with a turquoise highlighter, his spluttering outrage is unintentionally hilarious. \"I'm afraid I could never trust someone who would make irremovable marks in a library book.\"Unfortunately, having brought the conflict between Bates and Alex to a simmer, Lodge never permits it to boil over. Instead, he abruptly exiles Alex from the \u00adstory, turning his attention instead to Bates's attempts to salvage his marriage with Fred. Their trip to an appalling holiday camp called Gladeworld is loaded with comic potential, but winds up being merely glum. The focus then turns to Bates's relationship with his headstrong, increasingly senile father, a former jazz musician and character actor who refuses to abandon his longtime London home for the high-end assisted-living community where Bates wants to place him. By now, the farce Lodge promised early on has given way to bittersweet domestic drama.The novel shifts even further into solemnity when Bates embarks on a lecture tour of Poland, where an impulsive trip to Auschwitz sets the stage for a disturbing revelation about the death of Bates's first wife. Although these scenes can be quietly moving, it is hard not to wish that Lodge had listened to his hero's dictum and explored the comic potential of his affliction to its bitter end.'One thing we deafies can do at a party is give people a few laughs with our mistakes,' Bates maintains."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/us/04klima.html", "headline": "Edward S. Klima, Sign Language Expert, Dies at 77", "date": "2008-10-03T23:48:13+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Edward S. Klima, an eminent linguist who was one of the first scholars to pay serious attention to sign languages, and in so doing helped them win long-denied recognition as languages in their own right, died on Sept. 25 in the La Jolla section of San Diego. He was 77 and had lived in La Jolla for many years.The cause was complications of brain surgery, his family said.At his death, Dr. Klima was emeritus professor of linguistics at the University of California, San Diego. He was also an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego and the associate director of the institute\u2019s laboratory for cognitive neuroscience.Much of Dr. Klima\u2019s work was done in collaboration with his wife, Ursula Bellugi, a professor at Salk and the laboratory\u2019s longtime director. They were known in particular for their long, painstaking unraveling of the grammatical structure of American Sign Language, and for using what they found to illuminate the workings of all language, signed and spoken, in the brain.Drs. Klima and Bellugi received the American Psychological Association\u2019s Award for Distinguished Contributions in 1992.Before the couple began their research in 1970, everything known about the human language instinct came from the study of spoken languages. Their book \u201cThe Signs of Language\u201d (Harvard University, 1979) was a landmark. Written with 10 associates, it is the first comprehensive study of the grammar and psychology of signed languages.More recently, Dr. Klima collaborated with his wife on extensive studies of Williams syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that combines mental retardation with heightened language ability.When Drs. Klima and Bellugi began work on American Sign Language, few people considered sign languages to be real languages. A.S.L., used by a quarter-million to a half-million deaf people in the United States and Canada, was widely disparaged as either a rude pantomime, devoid of grammar, or a broken version of English, rerouted to the hands. Deaf people were made to feel ashamed of it. Teachers of the deaf tried to suppress it, forcing pupils to speak and read lips instead, no mean feat if one cannot hear.Working with deaf informants, Drs. Klima and Bellugi established conclusively that the world\u2019s signed languages \u0097 and there are more than a hundred of them \u0097 are very much real languages, as complex, abstract and systematic as spoken ones. In A.S.L., they found a lexicon bursting with nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and pronouns; orderly grammar and syntax quite different from those of English; indigenous poetry; and even regional and ethnic dialects.ImageEdward S. Klima, in 2004.Credit...University of California, San DiegoEdward Stephan Klima was born in Cleveland on June 21, 1931. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in linguistics from Dartmouth in 1953, followed by master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in the field from Harvard in 1955 and 1965.By the time Dr. Klima got his Ph.D., linguistics had undergone a seismic upheaval. In 1957, a young scholar named Noam Chomsky had revolutionized the field. Language, Dr. Chomsky argued, was not simply learned social behavior, as scholars had long believed. Instead, it was the product of an inborn faculty \u0097 an instinct \u0097 unique to our species. Overnight, linguists had a new mandate: to describe this innate linguistic blueprint.Hired by Dr. Chomsky in 1957, Dr. Klima taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before joining the faculty at the University of California, San Diego, in 1967. There, with his wife, he began to investigate the biological underpinnings of a language without sound.American Sign Language was first described as a real language only in 1960, when William C. Stokoe Jr., an English professor at Gallaudet College, was roundly derided for suggesting the fact. But if Dr. Stokoe was right, his idea raised tantalizing questions: How is sign language acquired by deaf children? How is it stored in memory? Which side of the brain controls sign language \u0097 the left hemisphere, where spoken language resides, or the right, which controls visual and spatial tasks?To tackle these questions, Drs. Klima and Bellugi stripped away the acoustic veneer of spoken language \u0097 the consonant and vowel sounds on which it happens to rely \u0097 revealing underneath the mental machinery that drives all human language. Among their findings were these:Like spoken language, sign language is acquired by young children in regular developmental stages. Like spoken language, it can break down as a result of strokes or other brain injuries. And, remarkably, despite its strong visual nature, sign language is controlled primarily by the left side of the brain. Sign language is language, Drs. Klima and Bellugi demonstrated, and at a basic neurological level, the brain knows it.Their work is widely credited with helping American Sign Language gain broader acceptance as a language of instruction for deaf people and, by extension, with helping kindle the Deaf Pride movement, which began in the late 1980s.Besides his wife, Dr. Klima is survived by two sons, Rob, of San Diego, and David, of Florence, Italy, and four grandchildren.His other work includes \u201cWhat the Hands Reveal About the Brain\u201d (M.I.T. Press, 1987), which examines the neurology of sign language, written with Dr. Bellugi and Howard Poizner.Dr. Klima\u2019s legacy also includes the entire field of sign-language linguistics, a lively branch of cognitive science with several hundred full-time practitioners around the world.Today, these researchers are vigorously analyzing not only A.S.L. but also British Sign Language, Czech Sign Language, Hong Kong Sign Language, Indo-Pakistani Sign Language, Japanese Sign Language, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Sign Language and many others, research that just 30 years ago was beyond imagining."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/books/chapters/0819-1st-fox.html", "headline": "\u2018Talking Hands: What Sign Language Reveals About the Mind\u2019", "date": "2007-08-19T07:47:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "The house is a lighted island in a sea of gathering dark. The sun has just gone down, and the desert breeze blowing in through the large open windows is cooler now. Outside, just beyond the house, fields of yellow stubble give way to a flat expanse of sand and scrub that stretches toward the distant hills ringing the horizon. A band of vermilion hangs above the hills, and above that, the sky is an inverted bowl of deep turquoise. Across the sand, a line of shadowy forms can be seen picking its way slowly toward the house: the village camels, home for the night.  From a nearby mosque, the muezzin's call to prayer floats through the open windows. The windows have deep marble sills but no glass, for the house is barely half-finished. Right now it is little more than walls, sheer slabs of whitewashed concrete that seem to rise organically from the surface of the desert. There is no front door yet, and no front steps: you enter, perilously, by clawing your way up a steep concrete ramp coated with blown sand. Inside, the house is hollow. Its half-dozen rooms have neither doors nor windows, and underfoot, where the floor will be, is only hard-packed dirt. Garlands of electrical wires sprout from the bare white walls; a black rubber hose of indeterminate purpose snakes across the ground from room to room. That is all there is to the house so far, but its raw state suits the desert.  On this summer evening, the half-built house is alive with people. In the main room, which overlooks the hills, the owner of the house, a stocky man in an untucked plaid shirt, has set a long plastic banquet table on the earthen floor, with a dozen plastic patio chairs around it. The table is filling with food. Children materialize with platters of nuts, sunflower seeds and miniature fruit - tiny pears, nectarines and plums. A tray of small china cups is set out, and a boy of about twelve enters, carrying a brass coffeepot, blackened from use, with a graceful spout curved like a pelican's beak. He pours the coffee: thick, black, sweet and tasting of cardamom. At the other end of the table, a boy with a Thermos pours strong, sweet tea into small glasses crammed with fresh mint.  People start to take their seats. At the head of the table, the owner is joined by a group of men in their thirties and forties. Down one side of the table is a row of boys in graduated sizes, from toddlers to teenagers. More children play on the floor nearby; some very young ones, a few girls among them, peer shyly into the room from behind the door frame. At the foot of the table sits a knot of visitors. There are six of us: four scholars of linguistics, a video camera operator and me. We have all traveled great distances, some of us crossing oceans, to be in this half-finished house tonight.  The man and his family are Bedouins, and the house is at the edge of their village, Al-Sayyid. Though they live in the desert, the Bedouins of Al-Sayyid are not nomads: their people have inhabited this village, tucked into an obscure corner of what is now Israel, miles from the nearest town, for nearly two hundred years. There are no timeless figures from T. E. Lawrence here, wandering the sands in billowing robes. These Bedouins are rooted, even middle-class. Men and boys are bareheaded and dressed in Western clothing, mostly T-shirts and jeans. Families live in houses, some with indoor plumbing and vast sofas upholstered in plush. They own automobiles, computers and VCRs. But there is something even more remarkable about the Al-Sayyid Bedouins, and that is what has brought the team of scholars here this evening: a highly unusual language, spoken only in this village and never documented until now.  The house is a Babel tonight. Around the long table, six languages are in use at once, conversation spilling across conversation. There are snatches of English, mostly for my benefit. There is Hebrew: two of the linguists are from an Israeli university, and many of the men of Al-Sayyid speak it as well. There is a great deal of Arabic, the language of the home for Bedouins throughout the Middle East. But in the illuminated room, it is the other languages that catch the eye. They are signed languages, the languages of the deaf. As night engulfs the surrounding desert and the cameraman's lights throw up huge, signing shadows, it looks as though language itself has become animate, as conversations play out in grand silhouette on the whitewashed walls.  There are three signed languages going. There is American Sign Language, used by one of the visitors, a deaf linguist from California. There is Israeli Sign Language, the language of the deaf in that country, whose structure the two Israeli scholars have devoted years to analyzing. And there is a third language, the one the linguists have journeyed here to see: a signed language spoken in this village and nowhere else in the world.  The language is Al-Sayyid's genetic legacy. In this isolated traditional community, where marriage to outsiders is rare, a form of inherited deafness has been passed down from one generation to the next for the last seventy years. Of the 3,500 residents of the village today, nearly 150 are deaf, an incidence forty times that of the general population. As a result, an indigenous signed language has sprung up here, evolving among the deaf villagers as a means of communication. That can happen whenever deaf people come together. But what is so striking about the sign language of Al-Sayyid is that many hearing villagers can also speak it. It permeates every aspect of community life here, used between parents and children, husbands and wives, from sibling to sibling and neighbor to neighbor. At every hour of the day, in the houses, in the fields and in the mosque, there are people conversing in sign. In Al-Sayyid, the four linguists have encountered a veritable island of the deaf.  Their work here will occupy them for years to come, in all likelihood for the rest of their careers. They plan to observe the language, to record it, and to produce an illustrated dictionary, the first-ever documentary record of the villagers' signed communication system. But the linguists are after something even larger. Because Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language has arisen entirely on its own, outside the influence of any other language, it offers a living demonstration of the \"language instinct,\" man's inborn capacity to create language from thin air. If the linguists can decode this language - if they can isolate the formal elements that make Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language a language - they will be in possession of a new and compelling body of evidence in the search for the ingredients essential to all language, signed and spoken. And in so doing, they will have helped illuminate one of the most fundamental aspects of what it means to be human. . . .

Yesterday, a judge in Queens took note of the shortage, writing a memorandum that explained why he had awarded an interpreter who was forced to work alone twice his daily rate of pay.The judge, Justice Charles J. Markey of State Supreme Court, gave the higher rate to Gabriel Grayson, a certified American Sign Language interpreter. It was after Mr. Grayson had translated for a deaf plaintiff at a six-day civil trial in June involving a personal injury case. Mr. Grayson had told the judge and other court officials in Queens of the normal two-interpreter setup, but agreed to work alone, for a bit more money, after officials could not find another interpreter to relieve him.The judge\u2019s memo was entirely self-motivated. No one at the trial \u0097 not the plaintiffs, Farrah and Bibi Wahid, nor the defendant, the Long Island Rail Road \u0097 disputed that Mr. Grayson should receive the higher rate.In fact, in his 13-page decision quoting experts on the deaf (and a former lord chief justice of England and Wales), Justice Markey explicitly said that he was trying to call attention to what he considers a worthy cause.The memorandum, the judge wrote, is intended to explain the court\u2019s decision in signing the order for the increased pay \u201cand to throw a spotlight on the disturbing lack of skilled A.S.L. interpreters in the courts.\u201dThat lack, according to research laid out in the judge\u2019s memo, has a number of causes. First, he wrote, the court interpreters must often wait months to schedule an examination with their certifying body, the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf. The exams are expensive, the judge wrote, as are the dues that interpreters must pay or else risk losing certification. The court\u2019s rate of $250 a day is not competitive compared with pay rates for similar duties in the private sector, he explained. Justice Markey also pointed out that interpreters are rarely given cancellation fees when they work in the courts, where hearings can be called off without notice at any given time.Justice Markey noted the \u201cexplosion of employment opportunities\u201d for the certified interpreters at video conferencing events \u0097 a much gentler form of work than the nonstop world of the courts. While there are no official studies of sign language interpreters in the New York legal system, Justice Markey quoted a study from Nebraska that said 65 percent of all assignments for American Sign Language interpreters in that state\u2019s courts went unfilled.Back in New York, he said, even in Rochester, which has the largest per capita deaf population in the country (the National Technical Institute for the Deaf is there), only a limited number of certified court interpreters are available. Justice Markey made specific mention of Kathleen Rozanski, a deaf woman in Rochester who filed a federal complaint in 2002 related to the handling of her divorce. Justice Markey wrote that Ms. Rozanski\u2019s lawyer did not hire a certified interpreter, but instead relied on notes, telecommunications devices for the deaf and family members familiar with sign language to communicate with her in court. In her complaint to the Justice Department, Ms. Rozanski said these alternate methods of communication had led to higher legal fees. Federal officials agreed, finding in a settlement with the lawyer that attorneys must provide interpreters to communicate with the deaf.Gordon Hewart, the lord chief justice of England and Wales from 1922 to 1940, once wrote, \u201cA long line of cases shows that it is not merely of some importance, but it is of fundamental importance, that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.\u201dJustice Markey wrote, \u201cWith increasing societal awareness and sensitivity to the plight of deaf persons in the courts, we can add to Hewart\u2019s famous dictum that justice, in the form of courtroom proceedings, must also be clearly heard and, for the hearing-deprived, must be unmistakably interpreted so as to be undeniably understood.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/21/education/turmoil-at-college-for-deaf-reflects-broader-debate.html", "headline": "Turmoil at College for Deaf Reflects Broader Debate", "date": "2006-10-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 - Ask Joshua Walker, a sophomore at Gallaudet University here, about technology like cochlear implants that helps many deaf people hear, and he is dismissive.\"In some way, you're saying deaf people are not good enough, they need to be fixed,\" signed Mr. Walker, 20. \"I don't need to be fixed. My brain works fine.\"Protests over the selection of a new president, Jane K. Fernandes, have thrown Gallaudet, the nation's only liberal arts university for the deaf, into turmoil. But the clash is also illuminating differences over the future of deaf culture writ large, and focusing attention on a politically charged debate about what it means to be deaf in the 21st century.Should Gallaudet be the standard bearer for the view that sees deafness not as a disability, but as an identity, and that looks warily on technology like cochlear implants, questioning how well they work and arguing that they undermine a strong deaf identity and pride? Or should Gallaudet embrace the possibilities of connecting with the hearing world that technology can offer?Should it demand that students and teachers communicate exclusively in American Sign Language, as some professors and students insist, or should it permit deaf and hard of hearing students to learn in whatever way suits them? Should it require professors to be fluent signers, and provide interpreters for those who are not proficient? Or should it let students struggle to catch their meaning, as many say they now do?These questions are not limited to Gallaudet. They are reflected in debates across the country as technology creates new possibilities for deaf people through cochlear implants and increasingly sophisticated hearing aids. With genetic testing, the day may come when parents can choose medical intervention for a child who is likely to be born deaf, or even choose not to have that child.With 96 percent of deaf children born to hearing parents, according to research by Gallaudet, many parents choose cochlear implants for their children at an early age, and 81 percent choose to mainstream their children into hearing classrooms.Joseph Fischgrund, headmaster for the last 20 years at the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf in Philadelphia, noted that advances like closed captioning and text pagers make it easier than ever for deaf people to have the same access to information as hearing people.It's a culture in transition,\" said Robert Kretschmer, coordinator of the program in the education of the deaf and hard of hearing at Columbia University Teachers College. \"What Gallaudet represents is clearly one very strong faction and identity of deaf culture, with a capital D.\"Lawrence Fleischer, chairman of the deaf studies department at California State University, Northridge, signed through an interpreter his skepticism toward some of the new options.\"More parents are choosing cochlear implants for their children,\" Mr. Fleischer said. \"We call it the false hope. We call it the magical consciousness, meaning that their consciousness is way below average, but they're pretending to have consciousness they don't really have.\"The implants are devices surgically placed in the inner ear, connected to a receiver around the ear which picks up sound, and transmits it as electrical impulses to the brain. They are not sounds as they are heard, unimpeded, but signals that deaf people must learn to interpret into words. About 100,000 people around the world wear cochlear implants, including 22,000 adults and 15,000 children in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration says.At the American School for the Deaf, in West Hartford, Conn., the director, Edward Peltier, said about 12 percent of students had cochlear implants, up from about 3 percent a decade ago. The school is the birthplace of American Sign Language.Many Gallaudet students say they felt misunderstood and marginalized within their families, until they attended schools for the deaf and learned sign language. They say Gallaudet should play a strong advocacy role, lobbying to keep such schools open and remaining a forceful proponent of American Sign Language.Students at Gallaudet have complained that Dr. Fernandes, who learned to sign only when she was 23, does not communicate well in A.S.L. -- a point the university disputes -- and that she has permitted professors who do not sign well to continue teaching, putting students at a disadvantage at the one institution where, they say, they should not suffer for being deaf. These students, forced to lip read or make do with poor signing, may not catch every word.One protester, Ronald Ferris, who is blind and deaf, said he believed that Dr. Fernandes did not connect with deaf people. In a measure of how personal the dispute has become, Mr. Ferris pointed to her choice of a husband as proof. \"She doesn't really feel us,\" he signed through interpreters. \"She's very critical of deaf culture, because she married somebody who hears.\"Bobby White, who leads a student group that opposes shutting down the campus, said, \"Communication is the primary and top issue here,\" adding, \"There's no reason for me, as a deaf person, to use my voice on campus.\"In an interview with I. King Jordan, who is stepping down after 18 years as president, Dr. Fernandes, the former provost, said that she was committed \"100, 150 percent\" to signing and deaf culture, and that signing would always be the preferred method of communication at Gallaudet.But Dr. Fernandes said Gallaudet's future lay in welcoming and valuing deaf and hard of hearing students from all avenues and educational backgrounds, rather than in promoting a specific deaf political orthodoxy. She would never ban spoken language in classes and meetings, as some on campus propose, she said. \"This is a time of great change in deaf culture,\" she said.The passions and issues simmering beneath the discontent over Dr. Fernandes's appointment help explain the persistence of a protest that some expected would have calmed after last weekend's arrests of 134 demonstrators. Classes have resumed, but protesters are still camping out in tents by the main entrance.This week, three in four faculty members called on Dr. Fernandes to resign, and the faculty voted no confidence in the board and Dr. Jordan. Until now, Dr. Jordan, Gallaudet's first deaf president, has been a treasured symbol in the deaf community.In the interview, Dr. Fernandes said that despite the opposition, she had no intention of resigning.Not all those opposed to Dr. Fernandes differ with her views about the technology or using spoken language. Nicole Moran, a sophomore from York, Pa., said she did not hesitate to choose a cochlear implant for her 3-year-old daughter, who was profoundly deaf at birth.\"Her primary identity is as a deaf person,\" Ms. Moran said. \"But it's a hearing world.\"Nevertheless, she said she did not support Dr. Fernandes. \"She's not an effective leader,\" Ms. Moran said.Others share this view. Thomas K. Holcomb, a professor of deaf studies whose two daughters were arrested at Gallaudet last weekend, said of Dr. Fernandes, \"She says that her leadership style is to act behind the scenes, but what we really need is someone who can lead us out front, who can be our ambassador and inspire the larger public with issues regarding deaf people.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/21/education/21gallaudet.html", "headline": "Turmoil at College for Deaf Reflects Broader Debate", "date": "2006-10-21T04:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 \u2014 Ask Joshua Walker, a sophomore at Gallaudet University here, about technology like cochlear implants that helps many deaf people hear, and he is dismissive.\u201cIn some way, you\u2019re saying deaf people are not good enough, they need to be fixed,\u201d signed Mr. Walker, 20. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be fixed.

About 100,000 people around the world wear cochlear implants, including 22,000 adults and 15,000 children in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration says.At the American School for the Deaf, in West Hartford, Conn., the director, Edward Peltier, said about 12 percent of students had cochlear implants, up from about 3 percent a decade ago. The school is the birthplace of American Sign Language.Many Gallaudet students say they felt misunderstood and marginalized within their families, until they attended schools for the deaf and learned sign language. They say Gallaudet should play a strong advocacy role, lobbying to keep such schools open and remaining a forceful proponent of American Sign Language.Students at Gallaudet have complained that Dr. Fernandes, who learned to sign only when she was 23, does not communicate well in A.S.L. \u2014 a point the university disputes \u2014 and that she has permitted professors who do not sign well to continue teaching, putting students at a disadvantage at the one institution where, they say, they should not suffer for being deaf. These students, forced to lip read or make do with poor signing, may not catch every word.One protester, Ronald Ferris, who is blind and deaf, said he believed that Dr. Fernandes did not connect with deaf people. In a measure of how personal the dispute has become, Mr. Ferris pointed to her choice of a husband as proof. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really feel us,\u201d he signed through interpreters. \u201cShe\u2019s very critical of deaf culture, because she married somebody who hears.\u201dHer supporters say she has taken a forceful stand on issues, like a racial divide, looming in the deaf community. Frances E. Kendall, author of \u201cUnderstanding White Privilege\u201d and a consultant at Gallaudet on diversity issues, said Dr. Fernandes had made enemies in integrating the lower school on campus, where minority children had been concentrated in special education classes. ImageJane K. Fernandes discussed her role as the new president of Gallaudet University.Credit...Andrew Councill for The New York Times\u201cShe\u2019s a visionary,\u201d Ms. Kendall said. \u201cShe is a change maker when changes need to occur, and she has incredible backbone.\u201d Bobby White, who leads a student group that opposes shutting down the campus, said, \u201cCommunication is the primary and top issue here,\u201d adding, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me, as a deaf person, to use my voice on campus.\u201dIn an interview with I. King Jordan, who is stepping down after 18 years as president, Dr. Fernandes, the former provost, said that she was committed \u201c100, 150 percent\u201d to signing and deaf culture, and that signing would always be the preferred method of communication at Gallaudet. But Dr. Fernandes said Gallaudet\u2019s future lay in welcoming and valuing deaf and hard of hearing students from all avenues and educational backgrounds, rather than in promoting a specific deaf political orthodoxy. She would never ban spoken language in classes and meetings, as some on campus propose, she said. \u201cThis is a time of great change in deaf culture,\u201d she said.The passions and issues simmering beneath the discontent over Dr. Fernandes\u2019s appointment help explain the persistence of a protest that some expected would have calmed after last weekend\u2019s arrests of 134 demonstrators. Classes have resumed, but protesters are still camping out in tents by the main entrance. This week, three in four faculty members called on Dr. Fernandes to resign, and the faculty voted no confidence in the board and Dr. Jordan. Until now, Dr. Jordan, Gallaudet\u2019s first deaf president, has been a treasured symbol in the deaf community. In the interview, Dr. Fernandes said that despite the opposition, she had no intention of resigning.Not all those opposed to Dr. Fernandes differ with her views about the technology or using spoken language. Nicole Moran, a sophomore from York, Pa., said she did not hesitate to choose a cochlear implant for her 3-year-old daughter, who was profoundly deaf at birth. \u201cHer primary identity is as a deaf person,\u201d Ms. Moran said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a hearing world.\u201d Nevertheless, she said she did not support Dr. Fernandes. \u201cShe\u2019s not an effective leader,\u201d Ms. Moran said. Others share this view. Thomas K. Holcomb, a professor of deaf studies whose two daughters were arrested at Gallaudet last weekend, said of Dr. Fernandes, \u201cShe says that her leadership style is to act behind the scenes, but what we really need is someone who can lead us out front, who can be our ambassador and inspire the larger public with issues regarding deaf people.\u201d "}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/14/education/students-arrested-in-third-day-of-protest-at-college-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Students Arrested in Third Day of Protest at College for the Deaf", "date": "2006-10-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 - The authorities at Gallaudet University, the nation's only liberal arts university for the deaf, moved on Friday to end a three-day siege by protesters by arresting the students opposing the board's choice of the next president.The campus police went into an area where about 100 protesters sat with arms interlocked, arresting them one by one and handing them over to Washington police officers who had blocked off the street along a side entrance to the university where the student protesters had gathered.

She attended weekly services at her home parish, but could not follow the Mass beyond what was printed in the missalette.That all changed last summer, when the Diocese of Providence became one of the few in the country to have a deaf priest celebrate a Mass in American Sign Language, with a verbal interpreter.The priest, the Rev. Joseph Bruce, says Mass at St. Ann's Church in Providence and at other parishes throughout Rhode Island, where 60 percent of residents are Catholic, the highest percentage of any state.\"Attending Mass with a deaf priest who uses sign language is more inspiring than an interpreted Mass,\" Ms. Lomastro, who now volunteers as a lector at the deaf Mass, wrote in an e-mail message. \"When Father Bruce signs, it is coming from his inner self.\"Father Bruce is one of seven deaf priests ministering in the United States, said the Rev. Thomas Coughlin, head of the Dominican Missionaries for the Deaf Apostolate in Hayward, Calif. Four deaf seminarians are studying to be priests, the most ever at one time, according to the National Catholic Office for the Deaf.The four seminarians, along with an increase in lay participation, show signs of growth in a small Catholic community that has long struggled with its identity.Only about 4 percent of deaf Catholic adults nationwide attend Mass, said Arvilla Rank, executive director of the Office for the Deaf. That is largely because the experience of attending a spoken Mass falls flat, and for some a signed Mass does not adequately convey inflections and nuances of a speaking priest's homily. A speaking priest, deaf people say, cannot bridge the gap beyond language and into deaf culture.\"It's really kind of boring to sit there on the other end and not understand, to be missing information,\" Connie Wild, director of the deaf ministry in the Diocese of Orange County, Calif., said. \"There's an opinion of, Why go? The relationship with a deaf priest is one of sameness, of similar experiences and an understanding of culture.\"Deaf ministry is steadily growing. About half of all dioceses offer deaf-ministry programs. Most have Masses interpreted into American Sign Language. Some larger dioceses have hearing priests who are fluent in American Sign Language sign a weekly Mass.The biggest change, those who work in deaf ministry said, is that more deaf lay people are attending church and becoming involved in parish life.\"It's pretty awesome,\" Ms. Wild said. \"I see more and more Catholic deaf lay ministers, meaning that more deaf people are involved in the church itself. There are many deaf Catholics who are older and grew up with limited involvement, and that's something that has definitely changed.\"Reaching out to youth is important, Ms. Rank said. Hearing Catholics who ministered to the deaf made up more than 95 percent of her Office for the Deaf 30 years ago. The figures is now 50 percent, she said.\"What hearing people have done is wonderful,\" Ms. Rank said, \"and some of them are very skilled at signing. But there's something that when you are the same you can draw people in.\"Although the deaf church has grown, many who work with deaf people worry that as dioceses grapple with financial problems, deaf ministries might be among the first to be cut because they serve so few parishioners.\"Unfortunately, many diocese are cutting funding for deaf programs, but on the other hand I see deaf people who are enthusiastic,\" said the Rev. Joseph A. Mulcrone, director of the Office for the Deaf in the Archdiocese of Chicago, which has had its financing cut. The Diocese of Covington, Ky., did not rehire the head of its office of deaf ministry, a spokesman said.Father Coughlin and others also worry that bishops do not understand the need for a bridge to deaf culture for deaf seminarians.\"Many religious superiors, not knowing how to sign, are in no position to assist deaf candidates in religious life formation,\" he wrote in an e-mail message. \"It is like the blind leading the blind.\"But Paul Zirimenya, a deaf man who is studying to be a priest at St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, Calif., hopes to remedy the frustration many deaf people feel with the church.\"The future is bright and promising,\" Mr. Zirimenya wrote in an e-mail message. \"I can foresee the growth in greater lay involvement in ministry with the deaf.

Though she had hearing loss in childhood, Mrs. Robinson, a 55-year-old resident of Woodland Hills, Calif., was not profoundly deaf until her late 30's.Mrs. Robinson, now at Temple Beth Solomon of the Deaf in Tarzana, Calif., said, \"It got to the point where I would go and just pray quietly to myself so as not to feel uncomfortable.\"Many aspects of society are not easy for the deaf to navigate, but synagogues historically held particular challenges. Few people spoke both sign language and Hebrew, so accurate translation was difficult. Moreover, a good deal of care and education of the deaf population was traditionally done by nuns. Jewish organizations helped the deaf, but many focused on social programs more than religious education.\"Synagogues just were not accessible to the deaf,\" said Paula Tucker, who was recently elected a member of the Jewish Deaf Congress board and is the director of Hillel at Gallaudet, the Washington, D.C., university for the hearing impaired. The Gallaudet Hillel has about 15 members and attracted 45 people for its Seder this past Passover.\"The deaf were alienated from the Jewish community and had very little education\" outside of what they got in the secular world, said Ms. Tucker, who can hear.Religiously, she said, \"Christian thought was to save the souls of the deaf, and since Jews don't have that approach,\" not as much effort was made.Rabbi Gordon Tucker of Temple Israel in White Plains, who also teaches at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, said: \"In the time of the Talmud, the assumption was that people who did not hear were, in effect, incapable of learning the culture. They were not considered to have the obligations of the commandments, and so while they were otherwise cared for, they were outside the culture. That is an anachronism now, when people who cannot hear can be more a part of the culture than those who do.\"In 1960, Temple Beth Solomon of the Deaf was founded in Los Angeles, seeking to serve this overlooked population. Ordained rabbis and a Hebrew school came a decade later. Around the nation, too, others began to find more ways to accommodate the deaf.Among those moved to serve was Naomi Brunnlehrman of Hartsdale, N.Y., who is a freelance interpreter at synagogues in the New York area, shuttling between Shabbat services at one synagogue and bar and bat mitzvahs at another. Ms. Brunnlehrman, who can hear, first became interested in the deaf during a high school internship at a residential school run by nuns.She got a degree in speech pathology, but her interest in the deaf was abiding, as was her conviction that Jews needed particular help.She studied at nights at a community college to become an interpreter and then at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan to get a master's degree in philosophy and Talmud. The combined skills put her in great demand.To Ms. Brunnlehrman, 43, signing a service is much more than a matter of direct translation. Knowledge of the service, especially nonverbal components, must be complete, especially in times of great emotion, when, Ms. Brunnlehrman said, it is important to cue deaf congregants to look around the sanctuary at other congregants to get a sense of what is happening off the page.Today, some synagogues have their own signers. Temple Emanu-El in Westfield, N.J., also has two members who use sign language. Carolyn Shane, the executive director, said invitations went out to congregants and noncongregants to attend services when one of the signers was translating, with the first two rows of the synagogue set aside for the deaf. The synagogue also has technological aids for the deaf in those first rows.Congregation Ohev Shalom, a synagogue in Orlando, Fla., has a rabbi, David Kay, who can sign. Rabbi Kay met his future wife, who also signs, when they were temporarily working at Congregation Bene Shalom -- Hebrew Association of the Deaf in Skokie, Ill.With signing more prevalent in synagogues and assisted technologies to help, deaf Jews have been going to worship and be educated in far greater numbers. But that has created a challenge for Mrs. Robinson, who sometimes leads services at Temple Beth Solomon, which has no permanent rabbi and where attendance has dwindled. There are currently 71 members, down from a high of 400, said Jan Seeley, the administrator of the synagogue and a hearing, non-Jewish interpreter.\"Deafness doesn't run in families,\" Mrs. Robinson said, \"so as our founding members are dying, few new members come to replace them.\"Five years ago, the synagogue sold its building and shut its Hebrew school. It now shares space with Temple Judea, a hearing synagogue in Tarzana.Ms. Seeley said that the synagogue also used to attract many nondeaf Jews, but that with greater access all around, there was less need today.\"The fact that deaf people have so many choices now,\" Ms. Seeley said, \"and can live in the mainstream with the help of gigantic technological advances and much less frustration is a triumph of their struggle.\"Mrs. Robinson said she wanted to see her synagogue for the deaf survive. \"Temple Beth Solomon gave me back the ability to fully participate in services enriched by the use of hands,\" she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/04/us/e-harris-nober-dies-at-77-created-alarm-system-for-hearing-impaired.html", "headline": "E.

Harris Nober, an audiologist who helped establish national standards for loudness in the alarms of residential smoke detectors and introduced strobe flashes to alert the hearing impaired, died on May 23 at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 77.The cause was liver cancer, his family said.Dr. Nober, who was an emeritus professor of communication disorders at the University of Massachusetts, had previously taught at Syracuse and Adelphi Universities.In the 1980's, Dr. Nober pioneered the use of strobe lights in the homes of the hearing impaired. He developed a system that connected doorbells, telephones and smoke detectors to engage strong visual cues of flashing lights.In an earlier study conducted for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Dr. Nober examined the \"waking effectiveness of household smoke and fire-alert detection devices,\" and tested the volume of detectors and the time it took for sleeping participants to respond and leave the building. The study's results were used to help determine the noise levels for detectors.Dr. Jane R. Madell, an audiologist and director of the Hearing and Learning Center of Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, said Dr. Nober succeeded \"in developing a way of manipulating the visual alarm system to indicate, by the frequency of its flashes, what exactly was making the noise, whether it was a baby-minding alarm or a knock at the front door.\"Dr. Madell added: \"No system existed prior to Dr. Nober's work. And before his system, there had been many tragedies.\"In other research, Dr. Nober was interested in the criteria for measuring hearing loss. With Dr. Charlena M. Seymour, a colleague at Massachusetts, Dr. Nober edited a popular 1997 textbook, \"Introduction to Communication Disorders: A Multicultural Approach\" (Butterworth-Heinemann).Earl Harris Nober was born in Brooklyn. He received his undergraduate and master's degrees from Brooklyn College and earned a doctorate in experimental psychology from Ohio State University.In the early 1950's, Dr. Nober worked as a speech therapist at Kings County Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn. In 1957, he was named an assistant professor of speech pathology and audiology at Adelphi on Long Island.Dr. Nober moved to Syracuse in 1962, and became a professor of audiology there in 1967. Massachusetts named him chairman of its department of communication disorders in 1969, and he remained with the university for the rest of his career. He became a professor emeritus in 1998.The American Academy of Audiology gave Dr. Nober its Distinguished Career Achievement Award in 1998. He was a fellow of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.Dr. Nober is survived by his wife of 45 years, Dr. Linda W. Nober, an expert in special education. The couple lived in Arlington and Cummaquid, Mass.He is also survived by a son, Roger, and a daughter, Jenna Nober, both of Chevy Chase, Md.; a sister, Marilyn Teitelbaum of Laguna Niguel, Calif.; and five grandchildren."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/23/arts/music/deafness-and-contempt-shape-a-mass.html", "headline": "Deafness and Contempt Shape a Mass", "date": "2005-04-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "No radical 21st-century experiment is ever likely to match the strangeness of Beethoven's \"Missa Solemnis.\"The composer's last word on liturgical music, finished in 1823, it is an assault on tradition, an escalation of human volatility to levels of passion previously unheard of and an act of contempt toward those expected to perform it. The Choir and Orchestra of St. Ignatius Loyola, under Kent Tritle, gave this astonishing if exhausting music an admirable try on Thursday night.Could the sheer size and relentlessness of the Gloria sequence be contained within conventional ideas of sanity? Beethoven's deafness was certainly no barrier to hearing and conceiving music from within; it wouldn't be for any musician of talent and sufficient training. It is a byproduct of deafness, the isolation from daily life and its needs, that may account for those stratospheric yelps demanded of his sopranos; the odd prosody in which he sets the words of the Mass; the explosions of massed sound, one built on the last; and the rapid-fire, tongue-twisting counterpoint demanded of the chorus as a whole.If separation from the world rendered Beethoven a little mad, it freed him from his inhibitions, at the same time leading him to forget that human beings had to perform the music he was hearing in his head. I admired St. Ignatius's forces for their intrepid singing skills, staying power and human involvement. Mr. Tritle did seem to narrow the musical range to something between loud and louder, or exciting and more exciting, but the deep, billowing echoes of this church allow only so much fineness and restraint.Beethoven was unkind to his soloists, yet Sara Murphy's soprano soared with a lovely musicality. Ory Brown , a mezzo-soprano, had good moments. Michael Lockley, tenor, and Charles Perry Sprawls, bass-baritone, attacked the men's parts bravely.The evening's curtain raiser was Haydn's Sinfonia Concertante in B flat, featuring a quartet of string and wind soloists. It was wonderful music in the wrong place. Sound slowly rebounding from high ceilings and distant walls smothered Haydn's elegance in a kind of rich sonic goo. It's not that the music wasn't heard; it was heard several times too many.Jorge Avila was the strong violinist in both pieces. Diane Lesser as oboist and Charles McCracken as bassoonist were first-rate. Arthur Fiacco played the cello part."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/15/movies/the-untruetolife-adventures-of-a-dj-who-goes-deaf.html", "headline": "The Untrue-to-Life Adventures of a D.J. Who Goes Deaf", "date": "2005-04-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Back in the days of raves long gone, the English radio D.J. Pete Tong, a dance-music guru and the occasional subject of media profiles and gossip, was bequeathed an unusual claim on immortality when his name became part of Cockney rhyming slang. The phrase \"It's all gone Pete Tong\" is patois for \"It's all gone wrong,\" and is now also the title of a faux documentary about a D.J. (not Pete Tong) who goes stone deaf. In \"It's All Gone Pete Tong,\" everything that can go wrong generally does, mostly to surprisingly sweet effect.The faux documentary has become such an established clich\u00e9 that it even has a reigning auteur in the form of Christopher Guest, the prankster behind \"Waiting for Guffman\" and \"Best in Show.\" The Canadian filmmaker Michael Dowse, who wrote and directed \"Pete Tong,\" isn't a purist like Mr. Guest, who faithfully mimics the conventions of fly-on-the-wall-style documentary, thereby making a mockery of the form and its claim on the truth. Mr. Dowse takes a less rigorous approach to his sendup, one that eases into faux documentary form principally during intermittent talking-head testimonials and some phony television bits. The rest of the time, the story assumes a more familiar fictive mode as it tracks the sideways adventures of Frankie Wilde, an Ibiza-based club D.J. played with genuine heart and talent by Paul Kaye.Taking a cue from \"Citizen Kane,\" a touchstone to which this film pays fleeting, cheeky homage, Mr. Dowse tells his story mostly in flashback. At the height of his fame and before his hearing went, Frankie lived in a mansion on the Spanish island, where he swatted away bikinied beauties by the dozen and ruled the island's cavernous clubs. With a body that looks like a couple of twisted-together pipe cleaners and a jagged yellow smile that speaks to the enduring excellence of British dentistry, Frankie makes a curious king of clubs. But he is royalty among these sun-drenched mortals, as well as catnip for groupies like his wife, Sonya (Kate Macgowan), and parasites like his manager, Max (a fine Mike Wilmot). As it happens, Frankie spins gold, not just vinyl.When we first meet the D.J., he is in the grip of a mondo coke habit that would make a goner out of Al Pacino's \"Scarface\" Tony Montana. Coke builds Frankie up, giving him the energy to spin for thousands of flailing, cheering clubgoers, but it also brings him down, down, down. If Frankie's rise and fall don't yield any new truths about bad habits, it's because addiction often tells the same old sad story and typically leads to just two possible endings: recovery or death. But \"It's All Gone Pete Tong\" is primarily a comedy, so it gives nothing away to say that Frankie's addiction isn't really the point, but the means to an unexpected end. That said, the fanged, stuffed monster that rides shotgun with Frankie during his binges is genius.This fiendishly perverse homage to \"Harvey\" aside, Mr. Dowse plays it safe. Because he more or less stays within the parameters of the faux documentary (and the biographical picture), there isn't much room for him to cut loose. He wrings soft humor from the usual sources, including a phony music video and different talking-head experts whose blathering turns out to be as clueless as it is essentially self-serving. Mostly, though, he gives Mr. Kaye room to push at extremes as Frankie loses his hearing and then his grip. The British comic turned actor (best known for his satirical celebrity journalist Dennis Pennis) appears in almost every scene and he carries that weight admirably. He manages the very neat trick of keeping you interested in a character who doesn't merit our affection but earns it nonetheless.\"It's All Gone Pete Tong\" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Kimberly Jones and Monique Dopwell -- otherwise known as the Lil' Kim case -- were consistently asked about their tastes in music, and in rap musicians. Here are excerpts from Judge Gerard E. Lynch's questioning of prospective jurors in the perjury and obstruction of justice case on Feb. 28 in a Manhattan federal courtroom; at the bottom are the results.A) Male, 50, postal worker, Mt. Vernon JUDGE: You mention that you're a fan of the Sugar Hill Gang? JUROR: Not a fan, that's the only rap song I would be able to name. JUDGE: I think that's what is known as old school of rap, and I think we got -- JUROR: It's a few years ago. JUDGE: In fact I think they're on an oldies tour. All right. One of the things that you said is that you had some thought that people who are involved with rap or hip-hip music might be more likely than other people to be involved in criminal activity. . . . Do you think you would be able to put aside any thought you might have about people in this business generally and decide the case based on the evidence? JUROR: I think so.B) Female, 43, homemaker JUDGE: You mentioned that you've heard of or are a fan of a number of rap or hip-hop artists. Is there anything about your interest in that music that you think would prejudice you one way or the other in this case? JUROR: I don't think so, but very hard to stop listening to Hot 97 in my house because of my children. They are glued to that channel.C) Female, 52, nurse, West Nyack JUDGE: Any particular kind of music that you listen to on the radio? JUROR: Soft music. JUDGE: You mentioned that you don't know whether rap or hip-hop musicians are more likely than other people to be involved in criminal activity. Do you have any reason to think that they would be? JUROR: I don't know.RESULTS: A) seated; B) challenged by the prosecution; C) challenged by the defense."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/23/nyregion/in-business-hearing-impaired-but-ready-to-work.html", "headline": "Hearing Impaired, but Ready to Work", "date": "2005-01-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "CHRISTINE MARMOLEJOS needed to take a dog named Buster down a few stairs for a walk earlier this month. Buster, a boxer recovering from surgery at the Dakota Veterinary Clinic in White Plains, was wobbly on his feet, stitched up and bandaged.\"Just walk normally, and I'll get his back legs,\" Jennifer Angell, a nurse at the clinic, cautioned Ms. Marmolejos. \"When he goes down the stairs, he starts to lean at you, so you have to support him.\"Ms. Marmolejos, 19, adeptly guided the unsteady Buster out the clinic door and down the steps, although she could not hear Ms. Angell's instructions. Ms. Marmolejos is hard of hearing and works at the veterinary office as part of the job-training program at the New York School for the Deaf in White Plains.Dr. Gil Stanzione's veterinary office is one of five county businesses that work with the school, training students for careers or further professional development. Students in the program spend half their day in class and the rest working at jobs supervised by the school.\"It didn't really matter to me, School for the Deaf or not School for the Deaf,\" Dr. Stanzione said. \"I was given the opportunity when I was younger and coming through, and I cleaned a lot of kennels. You've got to be able to start somewhere.\"Ms. Marmolejos, the third student from the school to work at the clinic, has been there since September. After walking Buster, she cut off his bandages, took out the catheter he no longer needed and spent the rest of the morning washing an energetic golden retriever who refused to leave the tub when she was done.\"I'm disappointed that people don't take care of their dogs better,\" she said in sign language, pausing from brushing the knots out of the golden retriever's coat before the bath. \"If I had a dog, I'd take good care of it.\"Besides handling the animals, Ms. Marmolejos greets customers as they bring their pets in, monitors the flow of medication and fluids during surgery and once last month helped adjust the machine while anesthesia was administered to a rabbit that was being operated on.\"He asked me if I knew how, and I was scared,\" she said of Dr. Stanzione. \"I said 'O.K., O.K., I'll try, if you make it really clear what to do.\"'A job coach visits on occasion, but Ms. Marmolejos usually works without an interpreter.\"Somehow we can communicate fairly well,\" said Dr. Stanzione, who doesn't know sign language. \"It starts out where they write some things down and all, and then we've gotten away from the pad and paper, and it's just an understanding of 'this is what needs to be done.\"'Katherine Grayson, director of the Bright Horizons Children's Center in Elmsford, has had a similar experience. Stephanie Pearson, a student at the School for the Deaf, assists in the Bright Horizons classrooms, where the children range from 6 weeks to 6 years old.\"I asked one of the children a question, and I noticed right away that this child answered me verbally and also in sign language,\" Ms. Grayson said. \"It's happening naturally with them.\"The School for the Deaf, also known as Fanwood, has a graduating class of 65 this year, and 14 of its high school students are involved in the job-training program.Candidates for the program are determined through years of communication among the students' families, school staff members and district administrators, said Sandy Lunestad, principal of the high school division. Many of the school's students have an individual educational plan, which is intended to help shape the curriculum to best meet the student's particular needs.\"That's one of the things you're trying to do all the way through, help them to focus on the job that they're going to have at the end, and how they're growing and learning what they can do,\" Ms. Lunestad said.The students in the program progress through four levels, each with decreasing supervision.Those with the least work experience start in Level 1, working in teams either at the Rye Town Hilton or at the Marshall's store in Hartsdale. Dianne Hamme and Erin Breidenbach, the school's two job coaches, are on site daily to interpret and to provide frequent guidance.The teams come together in a classroom on Friday afternoons to discuss practical problems that students may face at work. One recent lesson focused on how to ask for more work if tasks are finished early, with Ms. Hamme and Ms. Breidenbach portraying bosses.Students with more experience are placed in jobs, found by the coaches, that more closely match their interests. Level 4 students, like Ms. Marmolejos, are supervised only when they request an appointment. They are the only students eligible to be paid, promoted or fired.Eric Martin, who started working at the Hilton when he was a student at the School for the Deaf, was hired by the hotel full time in 1999. The students who work there are each matched with an employee who serves as a mentor.Jerry DeJesus, 17, was assigned to the hotel's engineering department, where he learned how to check the wiring to \"quad boxes,\" or electrical outlets. Ms. Breidenbach interpreted as he learned the significance of the different colored wires, and then he was left to check them independently. Other students work in the pastry department, in housekeeping and in stewarding.\"It brings us dedicated employees and dedicated workers, and it gives them another avenue to see different opportunities that are out there for them,\" said Debbie Coppola, the hotel's human resources coordinator. \"It makes us feel good, because we're getting great employees when they do come with us, and then of course we feel that we're doing something for the community, and something for them as well.\"Although this is the first year a student has been placed at Bright Horizons, Ms. Grayson said she would like to continue working with the School for the Deaf permanently. Bright Horizons' staff, she said, has learned from watching how easily the preschool children deal with the language barrier.\"I can't imagine the program without it now,\" Ms. Grayson said. \"It's just healthy.\""}, {"url": "https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/01/14/sign-language/", "headline": "Sign Language", "date": "2005-01-14T08:50:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\n                                    Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                            \n                                            Teaching ideas based on New York Times content.\n                                            \n                                            \n                                                See all lesson plans \u00bb\n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                    Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students will consider what defines their local town or community and create a welcome sign for their town after learning about a special sign that welcomes\n                                        visitors to Las Vegas.\n                                        \n                                    Author(s): Michelle Sale, The New York Times Learning Network Yasmin Chin Eisenhauer, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City\n                                    Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour\n                                    Objectives:Students will:  1.

Explain that they will be creating two-dimensional signs that use local flavor and pride to welcome visitors\n                                        to their local community after conducting research about the history of their town or local area. Prior to beginning their research, brainstorm what makes a good sign with students, including ideas from \u201cA\n                                        Neon Come-Hither, Still Able to Flirt.\u201d Design elements to consider include the following: colors, neon or other lights, typography, representative iconography (like the silver dollars on the Las Vegas sign),\n                                        a motto or adjective that captures the town (like Vegas\u2019s \u201cfabulous\u201d), size, shape, location, etc. (They should not be limited in their imagination by cost concerns.) Students should copy these\n                                        notes prior to leaving class for the day, as they will help them develop their signs for homework. To conduct their research, encourage students to use the following list of questions (copied into a handout\n                                        or written on the board prior to class for easier student access): -When was your town or local area founded? -Under what premise was it founded? -Who founded it? -What is the current size of your\n                                        town or local area? -What are its demographics? -What is the major industry of your town or local area? -What landmarks, historic sites, icons or other attractions (sources of local pride and/or popularity)\n                                        help to define your community?  -Is there a current sign announcing your town? What does it say? What does it look like? Where is it located? -Does this sign illustrate what your community is about? Why\n                                        or why not? Once research is completed, group members should review their notes and make sure each member has a copy of the notes prior to leaving class. If time allows, students may begin brainstorming and\n                                        sketching ideas for their welcome signs. Other group members may be consulted for creative feedback. 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students create two-dimensional signs illustrating the local flavor of\n                                        their town and welcoming visitors using the information gathered during class. Encourage students to use a variety of materials, including markers, collage materials, glitter, and other objects, as well as pop culture\n                                        icons or symbols. To accompany their sign, students should write a brief artist\u2019s statement explaining their work. Signs may be presented in a future class and then displayed in the nearest visitor\u2019s\n                                        center or tourist information office.\n                                    Further Questions for Discussion:-With what places, establishments and activities are neon signs most associated? -What qualities makes a city \u201cfabulous\u201d? What cities or towns\n                                        do you consider fabulous? -What qualities make signs stand out? -What qualities differentiate highway signs from signs on smaller streets and roads? From billboards? -What must an artist consider when\n                                        creating a sign that will be outdoors for extended periods of time?\n                                    Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on participation in class and group discussions, thorough completion of research and thoughtful creation of signs and artist\u2019s statements.\n                                    Vocabulary:neon, hither, flirt, evanescent, seminal, shrine, luminous, encircled, velveteen, beacon, Studebaker, marquees, tumbler, revolving, depicting, aptitude, silhouette, centennial, klieg,\n                                        blitzkrieg, vanishing, jaunty, commemorative, iconographic, pantheon, quintessential, landmark, median, foreboding, juggernaut, unincorporated, replica, transference, psychoanalytically, embodies, hipness, nostalgia,\n                                        sultry, beautify, populist, uprising, flirtatiously, assessor, exhibiting, divorcees, expletives, exasperated, moonlighted, consultant, commissioner, juice, fabled, renderings, constellation, suspended, residing,\n                                        literally, figuratively, typography, epitome, lilting, cursive, languorously, canopy, arson, perfectionist, dissatisfied, amateurish, stucco, engulfed, displaced, adjoining, miffed, public domain, mystique, flagship,\n                                        resurrected, scenic, byway, unanimously, designated, subsumed, dueling, cacophony, pilgrims, adage, logo\n                                    Extension Activities:1. Write a report outlining the career of a commercial artist. What kind of training does he or she need? What do these artists work on? Where might their work appear? Present\n                                        this report to your school\u2019s guidance office or career counselor to be used as a reference for students. 2. The article mentions several famous performers associated with Las Vegas: Elvis Presley, Liberace,\n                                        Frank Sinatra, Dean (\u201cDino\u201d) Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. Choose one of these legendary performers and prepare an oral presentation on this person\u2019s life and musical accomplishments. Why is this\n                                        person considered to be a legend? What made him easy to recognize? 3. Photograph neon signs in your community, local town or city. Research the history behind each one and prepare a museum exhibit illustrating\n                                        neon sign history where you live. If there are no local neon signs, find out if there are specific reasons why, such as local regulations against them.\n                                    Interdisciplinary Connections:American History -Create a timeline illustrating the birth and growth of Las Vegas. Include notes explaining the main attractions during each decade. \u2013\n                                        The article \u201cA Neon Come-Hither, Still Able to Flirt,\u201d refers to Las Vegas as \u201c\u2026 a city that has honored its history by blowing it up,\u201d mentioning three hotels that were demolished:\n                                        the Sands, the Dunes and the Aladdin.

AIDS can be conveyed by pretending to pluck clumps of hair out of one's head. Or by forming the letter A with both hands. Or by running one's fingers down the center of one's torso to indicate extreme slenderness.Certainly most deaf people across Africa know there is an awful disease out there. But their knowledge is very limited. When it comes to education campaigns and prevention efforts, deaf Africans and other disabled people across the continent have been largely forgotten.''AIDS is talked about so much in your world,'' Dominic O. Majiwa, a regional director for Africa at the World Federation for the Deaf, said using a sign-language interpreter. ''Hearing people know all about it. But we deaf people often don't get the information.''The problem extends beyond Africa, but it is particularly acute here, where the disease is at its worst and where disabled people are still often shunned, hidden away and considered a curse. .''These are the most marginalized of all people,'' said Nora E. Groce, a public health professor at Yale who is studying the problem of disabled people being ignored when it comes to AIDS. ''The stereotype that many people have of disabled people is that they aren't sexually active. It just hasn't occurred to many people that they get AIDS, too.''The discrimination against disabled people manifests itself in numerous ways. AIDS education seminars are often held in buildings that are not wheelchair accessible. Deaf people, many of whom are literate in neither English nor Swahili, are turned away from AIDS testing centers because nobody knows how to communicate with them. Education campaigns, often on radio or television, do nothing to reach those who cannot see or hear the message.''Deaf children grow up with the feeling that they're supposed to be quiet and be hidden away,'' said Julie Guberman, a deaf Peace Corps volunteer from Chicago who works at the Kibarani School for the Deaf. ''They see people's mouths moving. But they feel they're not special enough to be involved in that.''The Peace Crops has a special program in Kenya that brings deaf American volunteers to schools for the deaf in remote areas of the country. Ms. Guberman and her husband, Jesse, who can hear but knows sign language, said they were surprised at how little the schoolchildren at Kibarani knew about the disease ravaging their country.Making matters worse, some research indicates that disabled people, particularly women, are at a heightened risk of becoming infected. The rape of disabled women is a significant problem in parts of Africa, although statistics are scant. Researchers say the situation is aggravated by the mistaken belief that having sex with virgins can rid one of the virus that causes AIDS.In Uganda, disabled women recently issued a report saying they were being preyed upon and then forgotten. ''While the physically disabled women cannot run away from their abusers, the deaf, dumb and blind cannot shout or protect themselves,'' said the report by the Disabled Women's Network and Resource Organization.The Ghana Federation of the Disabled found similar problems in a survey it released in January. One of the many grievances it described is that those in wheelchairs cannot gain access to most banks, post offices, government ministries and polling places.Advocates for the rights of the blind in Malawi have issued a call for more H.I.V.-AIDS awareness messages in Braille.There are signs of slow progress. Susan Mwikali, 23, appeared recently in a commercial aimed at disabled people in which she urged them to follow her lead and use condoms. Ms. Mwikali, the first runner-up in a beauty pageant organized last year for disabled Kenyan women, laughed heartily at the notion that disabled people do not have sex.''Anybody can get AIDS, even disabled people,'' she said in the video in sign language, sitting beside Kenya's first lady, Lucy Kibaki. ''The deaf, the blind, the crippled, we must all protect ourselves.''The problem is that the commercial has not reached many people. Organizers of the Miss Disability Kenya pageant do not have the $1,000 that television stations are demanding to put it on the air, and the stations have refused to broadcast it as a public service announcement.Some grant money, however, is beginning to flow. Mr. Majiwa of the World Federation of the Deaf said he and other advocates in Kenya were turned down for years as they sought money from the government for AIDS prevention efforts aimed at the deaf. They knew deaf people with the disease. They also knew there was great ignorance among the deaf about how it was spread. But their proposals got nowhere.Last year, however, there was a breakthrough. The government AIDS council gave them enough money to hold AIDS seminars for disabled people and to begin producing printed brochures featuring sign language.The advocates, with financial support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, have also set up an H.I.V. testing center specifically for deaf people in Kenya, one of the first in Africa. Since it opened its doors last fall, 500 people, most of them deaf, have come in for testing and information. Nobody is turned away.''Many deaf people have died of AIDS,'' said Boniface Inyanya, chairman of the Kenya National Deaf H.I.V.-AIDS Education Program, using an interpreter. ''Many of them are H.I.V. positive. Even more do not know enough to protect themselves.''Just as at other testing centers, patients line up to have their blood analyzed and wait nervously with a counselor for the results. But at the clinic in Buru Buru, on the outskirts of Nairobi, the results and information about how to deal with them are communicated in sign language.To say H.I.V. positive, counselors first make the sign for AIDS. Then they shake their right fist up and down, meaning positive. Often, then, the patient begins to cry."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/24/nyregion/after-deaf-man-is-fatally-shot-grieving-family-wonders-why.html", "headline": "After Deaf Man Is Fatally Shot, Grieving Family Wonders Why", "date": "2004-01-24T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "No one can figure out why 24-year-old Kevin Lazare was fatally shot in the back at a deserted bus stop in Brownsville, Brooklyn, early yesterday. He had no criminal record and no known enemies, and his wallet was found on himHis family fears that his most serious offense was being deaf.''If his back is turned, he wouldn't understand what someone was saying to him,'' said Mr. Lazare's mother, Kathleen Lazare.Mr. Lazare, a construction worker, had played basketball on Thursday night at a school recreation center near his mother's clothing store, Roots International, as he often did, his family said. At 1:30 a.m. yesterday he was apparently waiting for the B15 bus in front of the school, Intermediate School 275 at Hegeman and Rockaway Avenues, to take him back to his family's house two miles away in the New Lots section.But an officer a few blocks away heard shots, a law enforcement official said yesterday. When he arrived at the scene there was no one there but Mr. Lazare, lying in a pool of blood with three bullet holes in his North Face parka, law enforcement officials and his family said. If there were witnesses, none have come forward.There was not much money in Mr. Lazare's wallet, a police official said, but then there had not been much in it at the start of the evening. Mr. Lazare's stepfather and employer, Kenneth Mano, said the young man had asked him for bus fare in the afternoon. Mr. Mano gave him $10 and told him to get home early so they could go to work together the next morning.Mr. Lazare, deaf since birth, was born in Trinidad and moved to Brooklyn with his family when he was 12. He loved the Los Angeles Lakers and played basketball every chance he got. He dressed in hip-hop clothes and liked to clown around. His family has a video of him making up a rap song in sign language. ''Every time I'm sad, he tried to make me laugh,'' said his cousin Dion Jack, 13.His mother relied on him. ''Places where I'd want to go, he would tell me how to get there,'' she said.Because Mr. Lazare's disability was invisible, people often missed it, his mother said. People trying to get by him on the street would say, ''Excuse me,'' and when he did not respond, she said, they shoved him. ''I'd say: 'Why are you pushing him? He can't hear you. He's deaf and dumb.' And they'd say, 'I'm sorry.'''Around 7 Thursday night, Ms. Lazare said, her son was headed out to play ball. He invited his 19-year-old brother, Kieron, to join him, but Kieron had to go to a G.E.D. class. Kevin hugged his mother goodbye and signed to his sister, Kenya Mano, 9, that he would be back later. The next time they saw him was yesterday morning, when they went to claim his bagged body at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, a few blocks from the shooting. It was the second time this month that the family had been shaken by violence -- Kevin's father was killed two weeks ago in a robbery in Trinidad.While some of Mr. Lazare's relatives set up a memorial on the sidewalk in front of the school yesterday, with candles shielded from the wind by a paper-towel box, others tried to clean up the frozen blood that had congealed there. Eventually a custodian came out of the school and offered them some cleaning fluid.A little later the B15 wheezed by. ''I want to take my kids and get out of here,'' Ms. Lazare said. ''Every time I see this bus, I'm going to remember Kevin.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/books/art-a-laboratory-for-sign-language.html", "headline": "A Laboratory for Sign Language", "date": "2003-12-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "CHASE BANK, PBS, Barneys New York, Mobil Oil: few corporate logos, posters or shopping bags are as familiar as these and scores of others created over the last 40 years by the graphic-design firm Chermayeff & Geismar. Yet while its work is ubiquitous, the firm's name is largely unknown. Since graphic design is usually unsigned, even the most prolific creators are rarely recognized outside a small professional circle. Now an exhibition, ''Chermayeff & Geismar Inc: Designing Over Four Decades'' at the Cooper Union School of Art in Manhattan (through Feb. 21), and a new book, ''Designing'' (Graphis Press), is putting the firm's identity in front of its most notable work for the first time.The exhibition is more than a portfolio of commissions produced by Chermayeff & Geismar's principals, Ivan Chermayeff, Tom Geismar, Steff Geissbuhler, Keith Helmetag, Jonathan Alger and Emanuela Frigerio; it is a seminal chapter in the history of postwar modernist graphic design and its vast influence on a visual language that is now ingrained in our collective memory.When Ivan Chermayeff and Tom Geismar, graduate school classmates at Yale University, founded their firm in 1960, Modernism -- rooted in clarity, simplicity and universality -- was the dominant style of corporate architecture and graphics. The firm helped push this aesthetic farther forward, raising the standard throughout a profession that still often relied on visual clich\u00e9s dating back to the late-19th century. From the outset, the firm combined modernist editedidealism, born of the Bauhaus, with capitalist pragmatism in creating typographic and pictorial sophistication, adding a touch of wit with visual puns.Using bold typefaces, asymmetrical composition and primary colors, Chermayeff & Geismar sought order and readability and avoided the more dogmatic aspects of the rigid 50's Swiss style, like its reliance on one typeface (Helvetica) and monochromatic photography. Following the path of the pioneer Modernist graphic designer and Yale professor Paul Rand, Chermayeff & Geismar's festive and flexible brand of modernism was rooted in experiments with quirky forms, playful colors and ingenious ideas as a way to explore design's boundaries while putting across their clients' messages. Below, nine examples of their classics.MOBIL OIL COMPANYDesigner: Tom GeismarIn 1964, when this durable Mobil logo was first introduced, the Socony Mobil Oil Companys service stations featured a shield-shaped sign with the word ''Mobil'' in bold, dark-blue lettering. The famous Pegasus, which in the prewar period was the common trademark, had been relegated to a tiny spot at the base of the shield. The stations themselves were also painted a garish sky blue. ''It was a time when many Americans were moving to the suburbs,'' explained Mr. Geismar, ''and unattractive service stations were not considered good neighbors.'' So, together with the architect Eliot Noyes (who had started design programs at I.B.M. and Westinghouse), Chermayeff & Geismar developed a more modern scheme. ''The idea of the red 'o' came about partly to reinforce a design concept to use circular canopies, circular pumps, circular display elements, et cetera, for a distinctive look,'' continued Mr. Geismar, who designed an entire Mobil alphabet from which the word is formed. ''The logo also served to help people pronounce the name correctly -- MO-bul, not mo-BEAL -- and, of course, it added a single memorable and distinctive element to an otherwise very simple lettering style.'' The recognition value of the flying red horse was understood, however, and a streamlined version of it has a prominent place on service station buildings.ALVIN AILEYDesigner: Steff GeissbuhlerThis poster was created in 1981 for the Alvin Ailey 30th Anniversary Tour and later become the logo for the dance company. Mr. Geissbuhler said ''it was the easiest job to sell and perhaps my shortest presentation ever.'' Ailey immediately understood that rendering his name as brush-stroke dancers showed that it stood not just for him as a dancer and choreographer, but for an entire dance company. ''The exuberance and vitality expressed by the dancers,'' Mr. Geissbuhler said, ''as well as the fuchsia-purple color scheme was for him totally right for the ethnically diverse members of his Dance Theater.'' And he was also fond of the way a central dancer is made by connecting the ''V'' of Alvin with the ''A'' of Ailey to make one figure.PBSDesigner: Tom GeismarPBS already had an attractive logo, designed in the 1960's by Herb Lubalin, that featured the letters PBS, with the ''P'' in the form of a head in profile, facing left. In 1984, Chermayeff & Geismar was asked to redesign the logo because of widespread confusion about the nature of PBS; Mr. Geismar noted that it was not a network per se, but a service for local stations. And this presented a fund-raising problem for the local stations that were refusing to use the logo. ''Basically, we decided to emphasize the idea of public television rather than the initials PBS,'' Mr. Geismar said. ''We took the 'P' from the existing logo, turned it around to face right, gave it a bit of a lobotomy and added a second (and by implication a third) head. So what had been the initial P became an image of 'everyman' to represent the idea of public television. We also recommended that a voice-over say 'Public Television' with the logo when appropriate,'' as an exclamation point.BIG APPLE CIRCUSDesigner: Ivan ChermayeffIn 1991 Paul Binder, ringmaster, and James C. McIntyre, executive director, of the Big Apple Circus commissioned Chermayeff & Geismar to create posters. ''I convinced them that the images should be more childlike than they had been in the past,'' Mr. Chermayeff said of the cut-paper, flat, simple image of a little elephant balancing on a ball while juggling the letters forming the name Big Apple Circus. It was so effective that Mr. Binder bought a baby elephant. The next year, the circus went ''west'' and Mr. Chermayeff put the elephant on the back of a buffalo with a cowboy hat and a lasso. ''Binder went out and bought a baby buffalo,'' Mr. Chermayeff said. ''Sometimes design has power!''CHASE MANHATTAN BANKDesigner: Tom GeismarWhen the Chase logo was introduced in 1961, few American corporations used abstract symbols; most were letters or cute pictographs. ''It was David Rockefeller who pushed this idea,'' Mr. Geismar recalled, ''and it was feasible because the newly merged banks -- Chase National Bank and Bank of the Manhattan Company -- were so large and omnipresent in the New York region.'' Mr. Geismar's task was to produce a design that expressed banking but didnt suggest something else at the same time. The now famous octagon, which was influenced by traditional Japanese crests, ''was selected because it was a self-contained dynamic form that retained its integrity and legibility in a wide range of sizes and materials.'' More to the banking point, however, it also referred to ancient coins.BARNEYS NEW YORKDesigner: Steff GeissbuhlerBarneys, with the apostrophe, was a well-known mens discountclothing store on the corner of 17th Street and Seventh Avenue, owned by Fred Pressman and his family. In the early 80's, Pressman's sons decided to add upscale womens clothes and accessories. The store was modernized and required a more sophisticated design. ''We created the new name 'Barneys New York' without an apostrophe,'' Mr. Geissbuhler said, ''to take it out of the low-end association, as in Vinny's Pizza, Bob's Garage, et cetera.'' The space between the 'w' and the 'y' in New York was also eliminated, without losing legibility, which allowed the same number of letters in BARNEYS and NEWYORK when they are stacked. ''Of course, something which only we designers seem to have noticed is the vertical NY in the middle of the logo (a kiss by the muse)''.ELLIS ISLANDDesigners: Chermayeff & Geismar IncFor the permanent exhibition at the restored Ellis Island, which opened in 1986, the firm put together a research team to contact people across the country urging them to search their attics for things that their parents and grandparents had carried with them when they immigrated to the United States. ''All the permanent exhibitions at Ellis Island were designed to present the facts of processing,'' Mr. Chermayeff said, ''to remind people today where immigrants came from, when they came and what they brought with them, and finally where they went across the country.'' It was an all-out effort. Rooms were restored. Wedding gowns, bibles, carpenters' tools and personal mementos were gathered and are exhibited today. The ethnic backgrounds, ages, sex and other statistical information about the immigrants, along with their paths across Europe and the ships that carried them, are all here, along with montages of descendants.GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM POSTERDesigner: Ivan ChermayeffIn 1975, when Mobil Oil began sponsoring some of New York's museums by keeping them open on Tuesday evenings, Mr. Chermayeff designed bus-shelter posters, one each for the Whitney and the Guggenheim. They were everywhere and drew people to the museums in droves. Mr. Chermayeff explained that the common conceptual thread for each was the distinctive architecture of the Whitney by Marcel Breuer and the Guggenheim by Frank Lloyd Wright. ''The type was done to wrap that distinctive hat of the Guggenheim so the hat and the type fit each other, while the Whitneys message conformed to the upside-down ziggurat.''9 WEST 57TH STREETDesigner: Ivan ChermayeffThe ski-slope contour of 9 West 57th Street, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore Owings & Merrill, became the inspiration for this landmark street sculpture designed in 1974. ''Why not make the slope the launching pad for the nine and land it on the sidewalk?'' Mr. Chermayeff recalled. Of course, he understood that his little joke could be impractical, since the cost of being on city-owned property outside the building's boundary was considerably more than the cost of putting the nine on the travertine facade. But to his surprise the developer bought the idea. To make it stable, there is a steel column under the nine going down three floors to support the weight of the steel sculpture, which costs $100 a month in rent. But that's the least of the problems; as Mr. Chermayeff noted, the nine reads well from Fifth Avenue but is backward from Sixth Avenue. Also, he said, ''Being in the path of pedestrians, women run their diamond rings on it walking by, which means it needs to be repainted frequently.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/07/business/executive-life-the-boss-helping-deaf-investors.html", "headline": "Helping Deaf Investors", "date": "2003-12-07T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "IN 1947, when I was born, medical technology was medieval at best. Clapping of the hands was a popular method in those days to test a child's hearing ability. But, as we all know, it is not very accurate. My hearing loss was ''discovered'' by a nurse when I was about 2 years old.For a short time, I attended Public School 47, which happens to be the only public school for the deaf in New York City. I was mainstreamed into a Catholic school at fourth grade and, at that point, I lost touch with the deaf world until I was 36 years old.I had my first summer job at 15 as a messenger for a shipping company, Moore-McCormack Line, in downtown Manhattan. Delivering packages and important documents for senior executives gave me a taste of the opportunities and the vibrancy that Wall Street has to offer. I immediately fell in love with the hustle and bustle environment.In 1981, I was trying to become a chartist on the floor of the Commodities Exchange. (A chartist is someone who charts the price fluctuation of a particular commodity or stock by using x's and o's to mark each price uptick and downtick.) I enrolled at the Wall Street School of Finance to learn more about charting. My teacher was Ralph Acampora, currently the director of technical analysis at Prudential Equity Group.Unable to understand him on my first day -- he had his back to the class the whole time, writing on the blackboard -- I asked him if he could tutor me privately. He saw that I was deaf and very eager to learn, and offered to tutor me for an hour each week for six months. His love for technical analysis rubbed off on me and I sort of became his disciple. I got my start at Merrill Lynch as the first deaf person to attain the position of technical analyst.Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0Feb. 4, 2022, 1:43 p.m. ETHere\u2019s what you need to know about the January jobs report.Architects at a prominent New York firm drop their unionization bid.Hertz hires a former Goldman Sachs finance chief as its C.E.O.After I joined Merrill Lynch in 1987, word spread in the New York deaf community that there was someone to bug for free ''hot stock tips.'' I became an instant celebrity -- a deaf-world version of a movie star or V.I.P. One night I went out with my wife, VickiJoy, who is also deaf, to an important deaf social event. I was immediately swarmed by partygoers seeking investment advice. I quickly learned how little they knew about investments and how closed off they were to the financial world.Six months later I drafted a proposal, and it was approved by the Merrill Lynch private client executive committee, to establish the first Deaf/Hard of Hearing Investor Service on Wall Street to provide telecommunication access for the deaf, sign language interpreters, closed captioned videotapes and hiring of deaf financial advisers.When I'm involved in group meetings that include three or more people, a sign language interpreter is a necessity. Following the progress of the meeting through lip-reading alone is extremely stressful, especially in a fast moving exchange. It's much easier to understand the interpreter's body, arms, hands and facial expressions than reading someone's mouth at the end of the long conference table. I try to structure my own meetings to be one-on-one or with two other people; in that case, a sign language interpreter isn't needed.If I ever become blind, I'll be in big trouble."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/23/theater/think-tank-deafness-as-metaphor-not-gimmick.html", "headline": "Deafness As Metaphor, Not Gimmick", "date": "2003-08-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Frank Datolla, a deaf friend of mine, attended a kindergarten graduation in which the students, all of them able to hear, had been taught a little American Sign Language so that they could sign a song about shapes.

The play has been reviewed by critics writing for audiences who can hear, but what is the theatrical experience for the deaf?Like the school play, this production, a revival of the 1985 musical based on ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' weds spoken English and sign language onstage. Unlike the school play in virtually every other respect, this production uses signing in ways that work both thematically and aesthetically.Developed by the California-based Deaf West Theater, ''Big River'' has not only impeccable lineage but also cultural integrity preserved at every turn, from the remarkably fine translation -- at once faithful and inventive -- created by four of what the program terms ''A.S.L. Masters'' to the deeply intimate, never patronizing balance sustained among the deaf and hearing actors onstage.But both the embarrassing instance of the school play and the artistic achievement of ''Big River'' beg the question of why. To what end are the culture and language of the deaf presented as art before the larger hearing public? What appetites are being met and whose?It is probably safe to say that it was not for Mr. Datolla's benefit. Fair enough. Deafness is a low-incidence disability. About 10 percent of the general population has some kind of hearing impairment; the percentage who identify themselves as culturally deaf (the group likely to use sign language) is only about 1 percent of this, something less than 290,000 people nationwide. Certainly the prospect of ticket revenues from this tiny group is not the stuff to get a Broadway producer's heart racing. So the fact that deaf audiences can reap the pleasures of this production is almost a happy accident, resulting from the willingness of enough hearing people to flock to the show. And why is this?That question brings us back to Mr. Datolla's story, in which the kindergartners earnestly peered out at the audience through the vaguely triangular windows their little hands formed before their faces. The hearing person's fascination with sign language all too often treads a wavy line between respect and condescension, with misappropriation of the language one unfortunate result. Another, subtler pitfall is the technically correct use of sign language in a context that makes of it, in Mr. Datolla's phrase, ''a dog-and-pony show.''Here he gets a vapid, rapt look on his face. ''Sign language is so beautiful,'' he signs, in a gushing mockery of the attitude that exoticizes sign and correspondingly reduces deaf people to the status of pets, mascots. ''It's just so wonderful that deaf people can communicate!''One of the laudable things about ''Big River'' is that it never lets the hearing audience stumble into this trap; it excavates and celebrates the artistic possibilities of sign language without glorifying it, without ever making it seem too-too precious or maudlin. One never has the feeling that sign language was layered on gratuitously as a gimmick; it really works within the story, amplifying the theme of cross-cultural connection.As Tyrone Giordano, the deaf actor who plays Huck, pointed out in a post-show discussion the day we attended, deafness also functions in this play as a metaphor of isolation. But as evidenced by the other deaf actors and the characters they portray, deafness is never reduced to a one-note song. Troy Kotsur, in multiple roles, displays the broadest palette of sign language, using it in grand deaf tradition to repulse, amuse, hoodwink, delight, woo, disturb and move us.For Mr. Datolla -- who teaches biology and chemistry at Lexington School for the Deaf in Queens, and who has worked as a professional actor, touring for three years with the National Theater of the Deaf -- ''Big River'' is a welcome breakthrough. At the performance we saw, he appreciated many things, from the ushers' knowledge of some sign language to the opportunity to follow all the dialogue without having to turn his gaze from the actors to an interpreter at the edge of the stage.He was pleasantly surprised by the signing skills of the hearing actors; even the shakiest was intelligible, and some signed with real fluidity. He delighted in the richness and versatility of the translation, asking whether I'd noticed the use of an old-fashioned sign for ''home,'' which fitted the dialect and register of the characters better than the contemporary sign (I hadn't), and whether I'd found the freshly coined sign for ''nonesuch'' amusing, as he had (yes, indeed).Perhaps more than anything else, Mr. Datolla said, he valued being able to attend the theater with a hearing friend and know he was having an equal experience. He spoke of going with his dearest hearing friend to see two different sign-interpreted productions of ''Follies,'' one an apparently excellent production with poor interpreters, the other an apparently poor production with excellent interpreters, and the feeling of loneliness at the end of each show when they turned to each other with their mismatched reactions.For Mr. Datolla, attending interpreted performances is always, to some extent, an experience of disconnect. Receiving plays through an interpreter requires a high degree of concentration and practice; for this reason, he says, many deaf people don't enjoy going to the theater, even when it's facilitated by the most talented theatrical interpreters. At ''Big River,'' there was no rerouting of the message.Done this well, with intelligence, wit and thematic and cultural integrity, sign language has the power to do what any art aspires to: affect people's attitudes.At the post-show discussion, one hearing audience member confessed he hadn't realized what he was getting into when he bought his ticket: ''I didn't think there were going to be deaf people signing onstage. When I realized what was happening, I have to tell you, I was pretty uncomfortable.''For the first three or four minutes.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/18/nyregion/the-police-make-2-arrests-in-rape-of-a-deaf-woman.html", "headline": "The Police Make 2 Arrests In Rape of a Deaf Woman", "date": "2003-05-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Two men were in police custody yesterday in the attack on Wednesday of a 21-year-old Brooklyn woman who is deaf and mute.

Today's disaster left average Russians stunned and enraged over the perilous state of poorly maintained school buildings.''All Russians are grieving,'' President Vladimir V. Putin said today. ''These were our children. It is our tragedy.''Officials in Dagestan said the fire, which may have stemmed from electrical problems, broke out around 2:20 a.m. in the two-story school, which housed 159 boys between the ages of 7 and 14 in a second-floor dormitory.Only about 25 children escaped unscathed, some by jumping out of windows, the television network RTR reported.Teachers struggled for several minutes to awaken children before giving up and summoning firefighters, who were unable to control a fire that was whipped by high winds. Within two and a half hours, the building had burned virtually to the ground, the Interfax news service reported.A nearby resident who helped battle the fire told Agence France-Presse that many children were missed during the evacuation because they were out of sight, hiding under their beds.Firefighters were hampered because one pumping truck arrived without water and because they had no ladders tall enough to reach the second floor, the neighbor was quoted as saying. That report could not be independently confirmed.Officials said most of the children probably died from smoke inhalation. The injured suffered from smoke inhalation, burns and carbon monoxide poisoning.Russian prosecutors opened a criminal investigation, but officials said the most likely cause of the fire was damaged electrical wiring or a short circuit, perhaps related to high winds that had blown down power lines and caused an electrical failure earlier in the evening.The fire was the second major disaster involving children to strike this southwest Russian province in 11 months. On May 9, a bomb filled with shrapnel exploded in Kaspisk, a few miles south of Makhachkala, during a parade marking the end of World War II. At least 41 people, 17 of them schoolchildren, died in the blast, which was blamed on antigovernment guerrillas.The regional government in Dagestan declared a day of mourning on Friday, when all the dead are to be buried. Some officials said the toll could still rise because a number of surviving children were seriously burned.The regional government said it would give 100,000 rubles, or about $3,200, to each family of a dead child, and half that to each surviving child. Legislators in the local parliament and many other government workers were contributing a day's pay to a fund for the victims, Russian news services reported.The Russian government this morning ordered a plane filled with medicine, equipment and experts from the Catastrophe Medical Center and the Moscow City Children's Hospital to be flown to Makhachkala.Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov demanded that safety standards be stiffened in schools, saying fires like the two this week had become ''a systemic problem'' in Russia's vast state-run and badly underfinanced education system.The government's Ministry of Civil Defense, Emergencies and Natural Disasters said it would work with the Education Ministry to upgrade fire-safety equipment and procedures at schools across the country."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/14/weekinreview/ideas-trends-written-notice-another-language-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Ideas & Trends: Written Notice; Another Language for the Deaf", "date": "2002-04-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from April 14, 2002, Section 4, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.IMAGINE a language that can't be written. Hundreds of thousands of people speak it, but they have no way to read a newspaper or study a schoolbook in the language they use all day long.That is the situation of the quarter-million or more deaf people in North America whose primary language is American Sign Language. Although they form a vast linguistic minority, their language, as complex as any spoken one, has by its very nature defied most attempts to write it down.In recent years, however, a system of graphic symbols based on dance notation has allowed the world's signed languages to be captured on paper. What's more, the system's advocates say, it may furnish deaf children with a long-sought bridge to literacy in English and other spoken languages, often a great struggle for signers.But despite its utility, the system, called SignWriting, has yet to be widely adopted by deaf people: for many, the issue of whether signed languages need to be written at all remains an open question. ''The written form is used by a small number of educated people,'' Valerie Sutton, the creator of SignWriting, said in a telephone interview from her office in La Jolla, Calif.Little by little, though, SignWriting is gaining footholds in individual homes and classrooms in America and abroad. Disseminated by Ms. Sutton's nonprofit organization (www.signwriting.org), it can now be found in 27 countries, including Italy, South Africa, Nicaragua, Japan and Saudi Arabia.American Sign Language is not English. Spoken in the United States and parts of Canada, it uses word orders and grammatical constructs not found in English (in certain respects it resembles Navajo).For a deaf child whose first language is A.S.L., English -- that is, written English -- must be learned as a foreign language, just as a hearing person might study Sanskrit. But there is a catch: ''The letters of the alphabet are based on sounds they can't hear,'' Ms. Sutton explained. For this reason, many deaf students never become fully literate in English, a perennial concern of educators. According to a long-term study by the Gallaudet Research Institute in Washington, deaf high school seniors score, on average, just below the fourth-grade level on standardized reading tests.Dawn McReynolds of Clinton Township, Mich., ran into the problem three years ago, when she discovered her 12-year-old did not know what ''bread'' meant. Born deaf, and fluent in A.S.L., Nicole McReynolds, then a sixth-grader in public school, was clearly bright. But standardized tests put her academic skills at a first- to second-grade level. As her stunned mother discovered after she pulled Nicole from the classroom and began home schooling, though Nicole had learned by rote to spell simple English words -- ''bread,'' ''map,'' ''yell'' -- she had little idea what they actually meant.''Anything I could draw a picture for, she was O.K. with,'' Mrs. McReynolds said. ''But things like 'what,' 'where,' 'when,' 'who' -- she had no idea. It was horrible. It was as if she'd never been educated.''ADVOCATES of SignWriting hope the system can help bridge the literacy gap. Though no formal studies have been published, anecdotal evidence from parents and teachers suggests its potential. ''It's made English come alive for her,'' said Mrs. McReynolds, who introduced Nicole to SignWriting two and a half years ago, after seeing it on local television.Where spoken languages operate acoustically, signed languages work spatially. Each sign is a compact bundle of data, conveying linguistic information by three primary means at once: the shape of the signer's hands, the location of the hands in space and the direction in which the hands move. (Facial expression also matters.)Devising a writing system that can capture this blizzard of data for each of A.S.L.'s thousands of signs is no simple task. ''When you write English, we're using two-dimensional paper to represent a one-dimensional language, because English is just a series of sounds in a sequence, and we write down the sounds in the order we say them,'' said Karen van Hoek, a linguist who helped develop SignWriting. ''But with sign language, it's the reverse: we're trying to get a three-dimensional language compressed down onto two-dimensional, flat paper.''Other writing systems have been created for A.S.L. during its century-and-a-half-long history. Some, used by linguists, are too abstract for everyday communication. Another, developed recently at the University of Arizona, is meant to help teach written English but not to handle literary traffic, like novel-writing, entirely in A.S.L.SignWriting, which grew out of a system for transcribing movement that Ms. Sutton developed in the 1970's to notate choreography, can be handwritten, or typed using special software. Written vertically, it uses simple geometric forms to collapse a sign's three basic parameters -- hand shape, location and movement -- into a streamlined icon, topped by a stylized face.Few embraced the system at first. Many signers, mindful of a long paternalistic history of hearing people tampering with A.S.L., questioned Ms. Sutton's motives. Educators feared it would deter the deaf from learning English.Though hostility has subsided, SignWriting is used today by only a small fraction of the deaf population, between 5,000 and 8,000 people worldwide, Ms. Sutton estimates. As Jane Fernandes, the provost of Gallaudet University, the prestigious school for the hearing impaired, said in an e-mail interview: ''There are many deaf adults who were raised with Sign Language in their homes and schools and who have learned to read and write English quite fluently. They were able to navigate between Sign Language and English, without a system for writing their signs down.''While acknowledging SignWriting's potential usefulness in teaching English, Dr. Fernandes, who is deaf, expressed doubt about the larger need for written A.S.L. ''English is the language of society,'' she wrote. ''It works well for us and I believe English will remain the language in which we write in America.''Nicole McReynolds mastered SignWriting fairly easily, and the English words that eluded her began gradually to fall into place. Now 15 and a ninth-grader, she is back in public school, maintaining a B average in a program for hearing-impaired students conducted in English.Before SignWriting, Mrs. McReynolds said, ''I didn't think she would be able to live an independent life.'' These days, Nicole talks of college. ''We believe that SignWriting is going to accompany her through her life,'' her mother said. ''There is so much more hope for the future for her because she has this ability now.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/19/world/us-envoy-says-zimbabwe-is-deaf-to-calls-for-fair-elections.html", "headline": "U.S. Envoy Says Zimbabwe Is Deaf to Calls for Fair Elections", "date": "2002-01-19T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from January 19, 2002, Section A, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.After three days of meetings in Zimbabwe, the State Department's top human rights official said today that he had made no progress in persuading the government of President Robert Mugabe to improve conditions for elections and halt intimidation of the opposition.In an interview here after his trip, Lorne Craner, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, said Zimbabwe was gripped with fear as the presidential election, scheduled for March 9 and 10, approached.''The electoral environment is very bad,'' Mr. Craner said. ''People fear for their personal safety, even people who are not active in civil society, ordinary people.''Political violence has been intensifying in advance of the electoral showdown between President Mugabe, who has run the country since blacks won majority rule in 1980, and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.Once a stable and largely self-sufficient country, Zimbabwe is now struggling, and the opposition party has tapped anger over the country's economic slide and the government's increasingly autocratic rule to mount the most serious challenge Mr. Mugabe has ever faced.The United States has threatened limited economic sanctions against Mr. Mugabe's government, like freezing the assets of the president and his associates and restricting their travel in the United States. The outcome of Mr. Craner's mission appeared to make such measures more likely. ''I conveyed to them that time is just about out,'' said Mr. Craner, who met with the speaker of the Parliament, Emmerson Mnangagwa, and senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Mr. Craner said the Mugabe government appeared determined to maintain its current policy course. ''The language I heard was something out of the 1950's or 1960's, about how a shrinking economy is okay, how it doesn't matter if they are isolated even from their neighbors,'' he said.Mr. Craner said he would meet with State Department officials to consider what steps the Bush administration should take.The European Union has been contemplating sanctions as well, and after today may be a step closer to imposing them. At a meeting last week in Brussels, the European Union gave Zimbabwe a week to sign a pledge to allow foreign journalists and election observers into the country. But according to news reports from Brussels, no pledge has arrived.Jonathan Moyo, Zimbabwe's minister of information, and George Charamba, the permanent secretary for information, did not respond to telephone calls tonight.The prospect of American and European action follows several days of diplomatic initiatives aimed at easing the crisis in Zimbabwe, which has aroused deep concern in neighboring countries.Leaders of the 14-nation Southern African Development Community assembled in Malawi this week for an emergency meeting on the region's biggest crises, including Zimbabwe.At the meeting, President Mugabe promised to allow international journalists and election observers into the country, and to order investigations of political violence.A day later, Zimbabwe's Parliament delayed passage of a bill that would have imposed new limits on the country's press and effectively barred foreign correspondents. But the legislation is scheduled to go before Parliament again next week, and the outcome of the vote remains uncertain.Today, militants of Mr. Mugabe's party seemed to deepen tensions when they stormed white-owned farms in northern Zimbabwe, and youths in government uniforms set up roadblocks to seal off several districts, The Associated Press reported."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/25/nyregion/sands-point-center-introduces-deaf-blind-to-a-wider-world.html", "headline": "Sands Point Center Introduces Deaf-Blind to a Wider World", "date": "2001-11-25T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from November 25, 2001, Section LI, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.MICHELLE SMITHDAS has been through hell.Not that you would notice. A petite, trim woman with short brown hair and blue-gray eyes, Ms. Smithdas, 53, will tell you, ''Yes, I am happy,'' and her rich, alto voice is punctuated by riffs of laughter.But it was not always so for Ms. Smithdas, 53, of Port Washington. Hearing-impaired since her birth, she became profoundly deaf at age 16. When she was 23, a snowmobile accident threw her world into darkness.''I went into a coma at first,'' she said. ''Then, after I came out of that, all of a sudden, things went out. Of course, the first thing I thought was that the light bulb burned out. I flicked the switch up and down. I saw no lights and began to panic. At first, I wasn't sure I would go on. I even thought about committing suicide.''But she regrouped and resumed her studies, graduating in 1971 from Gallaudet University, the famed school for the deaf, and earning a master's degree in special education for the blind from Columbia University in 1989. In February 1972, she arrived as a student at the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults, which was at that time operating out of a former spice factory off Jericho Turnpike in New Hyde Park. In 1974, Ms. Smithdas began teaching Braille, sign language and other communications skills to other deaf-blind people at the center, which moved to its campus in Sands Point, on land owned by the Guggenheim family, in 1976. This month it celebrated its 25th anniversary.''Because I am a former student, I feel I can honestly share my experiences with students who are facing the problems and limitations of being both deaf and blind,'' she explained one Friday morning last month as she sat in the office of Sue Ruzenski, a Stony Brook resident and an assistant director at the center.Ms. Ruzenski, 45, who can hear and see, was spelling a reporter's questions into the palm of Ms. Smithdas's hand. As she recognized each word or phrase, Ms. Smithdas nodded to indicate that she understood. Her mobile face was a montage of shifting expressions, from frowns of concentration to radiant smiles.''Yes, I am told I have a beautiful smile,'' she said as her husband of 26 years, Robert Smithdas, walked to a place behind her chair and placed his hands on his wife's shoulders. She took his left hand and began to spell words into his palm while he stroked her cheek with his other hand.''Our hands convey a lot of emotions,'' she said. ''I know when Bob is upset because his fingers will spell rapidly into my palm.''Taking a seat next to his wife, Mr. Smithdas, 76, also an assistant director at the center, explained that he lost his own sight and hearing after he came down with spinal meningitis at age 5.''I was totally blind and 95 percent deaf,'' he explained. ''As I grew up, I couldn't hear myself speak, nor could I hear others speak.''At age 16 he entered the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, Mass., where his teachers helped him to control the pitch and tone of his voice. In 1946 he received a fellowship to St. John's University, and in 1950 Mr. Smithdas became the first deaf-blind person to graduate from college since Helen Keller graduated from Radcliffe in 1904. He went on to New York University, and in 1953 he became the first deaf-blind person ever to be awarded a master's.He does not count that as his most important achievement. ''My biggest accomplishment is getting this place started,'' he said in a breathy baritone. Mr. Smithdas's face, unlike his wife's, was as sturdy and expressionless as a Mount Rushmore president.Mr. Smithdas conceded that he, too, has had periods of despair.''At first, everyone who has a disability gets angry and depressed and feels that no one cares,'' he said, slowly and carefully enunciating each consonant. ''But over time, you learn to have patience.''A one-hour experiment wearing earplugs that muffle -- but do not block -- all sounds, and goggles that simulate glaucoma, conducted under the supervision of Maura Platz, supervisor of the center's independent living department, provided a better understanding of the obstacles which the deaf-blind encounter while performing basic everyday tasks. Without sight and with only minimal sound, it soon became obvious why the world through which a deaf-blind person navigates is practically incomprehensible to anyone who can hear and see.It is not so much the silence or the darkness that make it hard to function; rather, it's the disorienting inability to gauge space and distances beyond one's reach. Walking each step becomes a strategic exercise in which one foot carefully feels the ground while the other is gingerly lifted and lowered. With only minimal visual or auditory cues to provide a guide to the relative distance of an object or another person's presence, a deaf-blind person moves through what feels like a thick, dark tunnel. A dim auditory awareness that other people and objects are nearby -- something denied to the profoundly deaf -- is confirmed through touch and smell, senses that, as Ms. Smithdas explained, ''learn to work together.''Making a grilled cheese sandwich in the kitchen of the Keller Center took almost the entire hour. It became clear that basic tasks such as planning menus, shopping, cleaning up, doing laundry, identifying clothing and negotiating transportation need to be taught with sensitivity and a focus on personal safety.That's where the Keller Center comes in. It was established by Congress in 1968 to teach deaf-blind people the skills to take care of themselves and function in society. In addition to the national headquarters in Sands Point, the center operates 10 regional offices and gives annual grants to 43 state and private agencies that help deaf-blind people.''As a society, we owe it to them to provide them with opportunities to succeed,'' said Joseph McNulty, 54, a Long Beach resident and the center's executive director. ''Every day, they show us that given quality education, rehabilitation and support, they can have great successes.''Among those successes, Mr. McNulty said, is the center's training of deaf-blind instructors and administrators. ''Twenty-five years ago, we had only Bob and Michelle Smithdas,'' he said. ''Now we have 10 deaf-blind people working in important positions, including two regional representatives and our technical supervisor.''''Some people come for eight weeks and others stay for a year,'' said Ms. Platz, a 31-year-old Port Washington resident. She pointed to the kitchen drawers labeled in large print and Braille. ''People who have limited vision can read the large print. For those who are profoundly deaf and completely blind, we glue utensils, bowls, soup cans and other samples onto the doors of the cabinets so people will know what's inside. We also create communication cards by pasting wood block letters or small objects onto laminated five-by-seven-inch index cards for those who have not yet learned Braille, finger spelling or sign language.''Thirty-eight people are currently enrolled in the residents' program at Sands Point. In the course of a year, about 100 deaf-blind people from around the country and overseas come through the campus, and there's a one-year waiting list. Those who are sent here for training make up a bare fraction of the total population of 70,000 deaf-blind people in the United States.The center receives $8.5 million a year from the federal government, about 80 percent of its $11 million annual operating budget. Most of the remainder comes from grants and charitable contributions. The real estate mogul Leona Helmsley has made a $525,000 contribution to a new conference center and auditorium that are scheduled to open in January.A sliver of additional income comes from fees for tuition, room and board. ''We charge each state for each participant,'' Mr. McNulty said. ''The money comes from the states' rehabilitation agencies. Although we charge $27,000 per person for one year of residency and training, the true cost to us comes to $100,000 a year.''That sum includes training on state-of-the-art communications technology which gives deaf-blind people access to the world.Joe Bhattacharyya, 30, was seated in front of a personal computer with a monitor and two keyboards, one standard and one that displays ''refreshable'' Braille by pushing up formations of electronic pins to form Braille letters. Within seconds of his typing a message on the standard keyboard, his words flashed on the monitor of a matching system at an adjoining desk. A response was sent, and Mr. Bhattacharyya, who is completely blind and profoundly deaf, read the incoming words on the refreshable Braille keyboard.As technical supervisor at the Keller Center, Mr. Bhattacharyya, who is originally from India and who now lives in East Meadow, supervises a staff of three, teaching students how to use computers with Braille displays and adaptive technologies. He has been working with the federal Department of Education, the American Association of the Deaf-Blind and several private companies to develop new models of Braille communicators and printers.''The equipment is very expensive,'' he typed. ''This system cost around $8,000. There is only a small demand for it, so companies are not developing new models.''This technology is opening up new worlds to the deaf-blind. Not only are they able to get jobs in such fields as data processing, transcription and computer programming, they can now access the Internet.''What prevents deaf-blind people from participating and working is that they don't have access to information,'' Mr. McNulty said. ''If you are deaf-blind, learning how to use this technology can open up the world for you.''But for regular conversation, signing still seems to be the preferred means of communication. Turning away from his keyboard, Mr. Bhattacharyya extended his left hand to Lewis Merkin, an interpreter, who spelled a reporter's words into Mr. Bhattacharyya's palm. Mr. Bhattacharyya explained that he was born deaf in a town in India but did not become blind until he was 9.''I lost the sight in my right eye when I was 6 because someone threw soil into that eye and my retina became detached,'' he said. ''When I was 9, I was chosen to be captain of my rugby team. Someone who was jealous threw ash into my eyes. The doctors tried to save my vision but they could not.''I could no longer play rugby and I was very angry,'' he continued. ''This was a humiliating experience. I had friendships before. Now I did not know how to communicate, nor could people communicate with me. People did not have patience with palm reading. I got depressed. Coming to America changed my life.''Maricar Marquez, 30, is a senior instructor at the center. ''My job is to evaluate students' independent living skills so that we can develop a personal training program for each one,'' she explained in sign language. Legally blind and deaf since her birth in the Philippines, Ms. Marquez moved to Canada with her family as a child and came to the United States for graduate work at Gallaudet University, where she received a masters' in communication administration before coming to work in Sands Point. A resident of Port Washington, where she lives in an apartment with a roommate who has sight and hearing, Ms. Marquez said she enjoys her independence and likes to challenge herself. An accomplished athlete, Ms. Marquez has skydived, spelunked, and gone rock climbing. In 1998, she completed the 11th annual Seacrest-Tobay Triathlon in one hour, 51 minutes, 46 seconds, placing in the middle ranks of 1,100 contestants. Four interpreters from the Helen Keller National Center swam, biked, and ran with her, communicating with taps and touches to help her stay on course.Nonetheless, she said, her biggest challenge remained ''how to educate people about what it means to be deaf-blind.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/21/nyregion/at-school-for-deaf-it-s-a-natural-fit.html", "headline": "At School for Deaf, It's a Natural Fit", "date": "2001-10-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from October 21, 2001, Section CN, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.NEXT month, the oldest school in the nation for teaching deaf children will be led for the first time by a deaf man: Harvey J. Corson.Mr. Corson, whose belief in equality for the deaf is the cornerstone of his educational philosophy, will be the new director at the American School for the Deaf in West Hartford.When asked how he wanted to be regarded in the new position, Mr. Corson, who was interviewed by phone with the assistance of an interpreter, said, ''I would like to be thought of as a person who believes deaf children should be treated as all other children are treated.''Indeed, it was Mr. Corson's reputation as an educator and administrator who could build bridges between the deaf and the hearing communities at the Kentucky School for the Deaf in Danville that led to his being hired at the private, nonprofit school last May.Carl Chadburn, chairman of the board of directors' search committee at the American School for the Deaf, said: ''You only have to meet him. Harvey was the most energetic and enthusiastic candidate we had. He just captivated the board and the constituent groups of parents, alumni, faculty and staff.''Mr. Chadburn's committee began its search last spring after the current director, Winfield McChord Jr., announced plans to ease into retirement. The committee reviewed 11 candidates before making its selection.At the time of the search, Mr. Corson said he was not looking to leave his position at the Kentucky School for the Deaf, where he has served as the superintendent for the last seven years.But after being contacted by a search consultant and eventually getting the job, Mr. Corson said he was ''honored to serve at the first school for the deaf in the nation.''He will be presiding over more than 100 teachers and administrators at the American School for the Deaf. There are 225 students in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 whose hearing loss can range from near or total deafness to myriad gradations of hearing loss.The students come from throughout Connecticut, with a few of them coming from New England towns as well as from a few foreign countries. About 55 percent of the in-state tuition is reimbursed by the state of Connecticut; the rest is privately financed through endowments.The tuition for nonstate residents is paid by their home state, and foreign students pay full tuition, according to Chris Thorkelson, the public information officer for the school.About half of the students, primarily those of high school age, live on campus during the week and return home on the weekends.Mr. Thorkelson said that in addition to a student's range of deafness, there is another critical factor that influences how deaf children learn: their age at the onset of deafness.Children who are born deaf face the additional challenge of learning language without any aural basis as opposed to children who lose their hearing at age 1 1/2 or older. From birth to age 3 is a critical time for shaping language skills, thus the school offers a program for parents and infant or toddler children.In providing background on the school, Mr. Thorkelson spoke of the desire by many teachers and students to demystify the belief that the deaf community is a place of uniformity.''The first and most important thing everyone here believes is that people who are deaf are as different from one another as people who are hearing in every way,'' he said.The American School for the Deaf was founded in 1817 in Hartford. In 1920 the school moved to its current location, a 54-acre, 14-building campus on North Main Street West Hartford. As a pioneer in deaf education, the school claims many other ''firsts:''*It was the first school in the United States to hire deaf teachers and the first to receive federal financing.*American Sign Language was born at the school.*The first deaf person to be superintendent of a school was a graduate of the American School of the Deaf.*The school began the first vocational education program for deaf students. The school is also the host of the only rehabilitation program in New England for deaf adults and emotionally disturbed deaf children.Mr. McChord, who was born hearing to deaf parents, has seen the school through a period of growth, including an annual enrollment increase of seven percent for the last nine years.He also established several new programs, including one for behaviorally disordered children. When he leaves the position, the 61-year-old Mr. McChord will head to Buffalo to serve as superintendent of St. Mary's School for the Deaf.Mr. Corson, whose parents and grandparents were deaf, has earned several degrees: a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Education of the Deaf from Gallaudet University; a master's degree in Educational Administration from California State University, and a degree in Special Education from the University of Cincinnati.He and his wife, Mary Ann, met at their alma mater, the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf. Mrs. Corson was a teacher before she retired. They will live in a home on campus at the American School for the Deaf.The 57-year-old Mr. Corson, clearly reluctant to list his accomplishments, nevertheless described some of the contributions he had made in his field, many of them centering around his work in Kentucky.He was involved in establishing local and regional programs for the education of the deaf, and he helped to establish a program for children from birth to age 3 in an elementary school in northern Kentucky.Mr. Corson was also active in promoting new legislation to recognize the role of the Kentucky School for the Deaf, a public school, in providing educational services off campus. Under his leadership, the school established centers on campus for literacy, behavior and homework assistance.When asked about his goals for his new post, Mr. Corson deferred to the staff and the teachers at the American School for the Deaf.''I want to learn more of what they've been doing and what they're goals are,'' he said. ''I think I am the type of person who will be supportive and innovative. I welcome new ideas.''Mr. Corson said he was most proud of creating a bridge between the Danville community and those children who are deaf and hard of hearing, and also of helping the students have a higher level of expectation for themselves.''Deaf students need to know they can, above all, be anything they want,'' Mr. Corson said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/14/weekinreview/october-7-13-limbaugh-nearly-deaf.html", "headline": "October 7-13; Limbaugh Nearly Deaf", "date": "2001-10-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from October 14, 2001, Section 4, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Rush Limbaugh, the maestro of conservative radio talk, has truly become the medium's Beethoven.

Mr. Grigely's interlocutors used scraps of paper, which for years he simply threw away, the paper seeming to him as ephemeral as most of the conversations, until one day during the early 1990's he noticed the scribbled scraps scattered around a table and thought that maybe they ''told a story,'' he said, ''without telling too much.''They were after all only half-conversations, sometimes implying but, intriguingly, never revealing the other half, with doodles, slips of speech, asides: the interstices of conversation, usually overlooked and frequently evocative, written down. They were also hybrid -- part talk, part writing -- and when looked at formally, Mr. Grigely decided, not unrelated to the scribbling out of which Cy Twombly and other modern artists have made art.So he began to try to make his own art with these written-upon envelopes, paper tableclothes, postcards, pages from mail-order catalogs, menus, foreign bills, claim-check stubs, cocktail napkins, hotel stationery, registration cards, art gallery invitations, Post-its, and photocopied pages of books.''Conversations With the Hearing,'' a series of works that since the mid-90's have earned Mr. Grigely a measure of fashion in art circles, by now includes spared scraps framed on a mantelpiece, like surrogate portraits, and scraps scattered around a faux living room, with couch, lamp, beer cans and coffee table implying the scene of a conversation lately abandoned.The most recent Whitney Biennial provided an introduction to Mr. Grigely's work for many people. He tacked variously colored scraps to a wall, arranged more or less in a grid, converting anonymous geometric modernism (Mondrian, Albers, Reinhardt and so on) into a personal voyeuristic art.Now he has returned to the Whitney with ''White Noise,'' his most ambitious installation, elaborating extravagantly on what he did at the biennial by concocting an oval room plastered floor to ceiling with more than 2,500 saved notes, a silent cacophony without beginning, middle or end.The culmination of Mr. Grigely's project, it is a tour de force of ephemera, so much so that it is difficult to predict where he might go with the ''Conversations'' beyond this.Eloquent, less contrived than the mantelpiece or living room (which can bring to mind Meyer Vaisman and Jason Rhoades, for better and worse), ''White Noise'' encapsulates basic themes: writing as drawing, the blurring of speech and drawing, found art, the unsung poetry of everyday chatter, verbal ambiguity, the mix of informal talk with the formal arrangement of scraps of paper, rhyming visual devices that suggest rhythms of speech, allusions to Mondrian, Twombly and, most obviously in this case, to the all-white paintings of Robert Ryman.The layout of scraps is a makeshift bricks-and-mortar arrangement, with strata loosely defined so that, as with shelves in a supermarket, one tends to notice what's at eye level first. This means different people will make up different stories based on whichever scraps their eyes fall upon, a throwback to Surrealist games of chance and a useful metaphor for the inherent subjectivity of language, if you regard the entire work as a single text. (Mr. Grigely, it is no surprise to learn, is steeped in postmodern literary postulations.)It's solipsistic art, peculiarly so because Mr. Grigely is absent from the conversations, but solipsistic anyway because we inevitably try to piece together a picture of him from the evidence of these scraps, which parade the gallery openings he has been invited to, the private clubs he has visited, the foreign hotels he has stayed in. They are the trivia of his life, solipsism being the unavoidable result of making art out of one's own trivia, even if the intended effect was to seem participatory, absent and open-ended.That said, the bigger impression made by ''White Noise'' is formal. It entails the delicate exchange among close shades of white papers, the variety of handwriting styles and inks as points of graphic decoration, the repetition and interplay of differently shaped sheets of paper, and the oval design of the room, recalling old panoramas.This is a panorama of words, not pictures. ''You wanna make your own clothes?'' ''She's a great party WOMAN -- not a girl.'' ''One mother of a deformed child said 'Normal is a town in Illinois.' '' ''It's a good thing we're a long way from home.'' ''I think I'm going to be sick.''Mr. Grigely has called it ''the unmistakable oddness of ordinariness.'' ''White Noise'' gives the odd ordinariness of his own life elegant, catchy form.''Joseph Grigely: White Noise,'' organized by Deborah Singer, is at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Sept. 9."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/31/travel/travel-advisory-tours-sign-language-guides.html", "headline": "Sign-Language Guides", "date": "2000-12-31T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from December 31, 2000, Section 5, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The City of Munich can provide tour guides for visitors with hearing impairments.

Jody Gill gives undulating rhythms, soulful lyrics and melodic riffs a face and body, personifying the sounds of music and language of song for hearing and deaf audiences.  As a sign language interpreter, she interprets music and lyrics through American Sign Language, an expressive art form that seems compatible with her day job as a clinical deafness liaison at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Westchester Division.For two years now, Ms. Gill, who lives in White Plains, has been on stage with musicians at the Mainstage Coffee House in Mount Kisco, in the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts. Using her head, arms, knees and everything in between, Ms. Gill, a classically trained dancer, can be a butterfly gently winging its way through a garden and moments later, convey the anguish and pain of a lost love. Although she has been in the field of interpreting for 18 years, Ms. Gill got involved in the music part of interpreting about 13 years ago. Ms. Gill, who is not deaf, is aware that some in the deaf community believe music has no place in deaf culture. She says she respects the choices of others while affirming her right to practice her art, which she talked about in a recent interview. Q. What are some of the biggest misconceptions that hearing people have about American Sign Language? A. American Sign Language, or A.S.L. as it is known, is not a slang or shortened English like most people think. It is an eloquent, full, rich language with its own morphemes and phonemes, syntax and grammatical structure. Another misconception about A.S.L. is that it is not universal. For example, British sign language and Japanese sign language are both completely different than A.S.L., and there are variations in how sign language is used even within the United States.  Q. What is it that makes A.S.L. the ideal language for interpreters like yourself? A. A.S.L. is such a rich, movement-oriented language. It is very conducive for interpreting songs. Anything that you want to say in English can be said in A.S.L. It's conceptual. It uses spatial relationships and classifiers. I think that music and lyrics lend themselves so beautifully to A.S.L. because A.S.L. is about stories. It's about discourse. Because there aren't any articles in the language and tenses are shown by spatial relationships, I rely a lot on metaphors. If a hearing person is singing, for example, and all the metaphors are about sound, I may choose to use a metaphor that is culturally appropriate for a deaf person. Q. Is there just one way of interpreting a song?  A. For me, there are really two ways to interpret. One way is to spend hours and hours with the artist, and feel comfortable enough to ask the songwriter, ''so what was your image when your wrote that?'' This way of interpreting is more about choreographing the piece. The other way of interpreting is at a festival, when there are 70 performers in one weekend. You may ask a performer, ''what are some of the themes?'' While I'm interpreting, I listen -- but I also hold back, and wait to hear where they're going with the song. It's less choreographed but can be just as enriching and powerful for the artist, audience and myself because of the spontaneity. Q. How did you go from being a dancer to a sign language interpreter? A. I have always been comfortable speaking with my body so in many ways, this is a natural extension of that art form. The whole thing for me started 15 years ago at the Hudson Clearwater Revival Festival. As far as I know, this was one of the first places to provide interpreters. Deaf people come to the festival every year. As far as I'm concerned, if two deaf people come, that's enough for me. I think for me, it was about giving these individuals the option to partake in something. It was and still is for me, an accessibility issue. Q. What is the main difference between a signer and an interpreter? A. A signer is not the same thing as an interpreter. A deaf child is a signer. A hearing child of a deaf parent is a signer. That is using the language to converse. What I do bridges two people. It's also important to add that when I interpret, it's not word for word. Music is not just about sound. It's not just an auditory experience. It's about expression, struggle, love, triumphs. Those are universal themes. They're certainly things that deaf people can identify with. Q. Why do some people in the deaf culture have a problem with what you do? A. There are many who believe that music is not a part of deaf culture. They have no interest at all in music and that to me, is absolutely fine. Some hearing and deaf people may also look at what I do as visual noise. It's distracting for them. My response to that is I believe in choice. I strongly welcome people asking questions about what I do. If interpreting becomes more understandable to the hearing and deaf communities, then it can only enhance the understanding between those communities."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/15/nyregion/for-the-record-a-star-volleyball-player-who-happens-to-be-deaf.html", "headline": "A Star Volleyball Player Who Happens to Be Deaf", "date": "2000-10-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from October 15, 2000, Section WC, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.IT happened a year ago. It was an honor, but a daunting one for a pre-freshman.Jennifer Palazzo, an eighth grader, had been chosen to play in the Fairchester League's all-star volleyball game -- not with her teammates from the New York School for the Deaf but with hearing girls who communicated with quick vocal directions in a fast-paced game.''I'm nervous,'' Jennifer told her coach, John Cleary, with rapid hand signs, questioning whether she should take part. ''Go ahead,'' he signed back. ''So you make a mistake, so what? You learn from it.''''And,'' Cleary said recently through an American Sign Language interpreter, ''she played and she did a great job.''Prinne Eberle, the School for the Deaf's athletic director, nodded in agreement.''The important thing is she played,'' Ms. Eberle said. ''We've had seniors in the past who refused to go. 'I'm not playing -- a deaf kid with all those others!' But Jennifer had the confidence in herself to do it.''When she came here in the seventh grade, she wouldn't have.''It's not the win-loss record that matters,'' Ms. Eberle continued. ''It's helping to build the character of the kids.''In that sense, sports have served Jennifer well, just as she has served the School for the Deaf's teams well.From its small pool of 30 boys and 25 girls at the eighth grade and high school levels, the School for the Deaf fields six varsity teams: boys' soccer, girls' volleyball and basketball and track for both boys and girls. Plus a cheerleading squad. Jennifer, of Nanuet, plays key roles on all three girls' teams.''She's one of the top athletes in our school,'' Mrs. Eberle said. ''She has the potential to be good at any level.''A star in volleyball, Jennifer is a starter in basketball, though only 5- foot-3 and 105 pounds. In track, she competes in diverse events like the triple jump, the high jump, the mile and the 4 by 100 relay. She has high jumped 4 feet 6 inches, only 9 inches less than her own height.But those are not the performances that matter.''When Jennifer came to our school,'' Mrs. Eberle said, ''she was a very quiet and shy kind of girl. A very bright girl, but shy by nature, and when she started organized sports, she was very hesitant.''She came to realize she had some talent. She wasn't afraid to make mistakes, so she was easy to coach. As her skills improved, you could see her confidence improve, and it spilled over into her everyday school life and her social life. By the eighth grade last year, she had enough confidence to work toward and become a representative in the student body government.''Mrs. Eberle is also in charge of the dormitories, so she had a widened perspective on the transformation.''Sports played a big part in that change,'' she said. ''Sports enables kids to shine in several ways, and once Jennifer found a place to shine, she had the courage to try other things. She learned from sports that even if you don't know how to do something this time, the next minute you can do it.''For a deaf youngster, it can mean coming out of a shell.''I've learned so much here,'' Jennifer said, walking on campus with the easy grace of the natural athlete. ''I knew I was good in sports even when I came here, but I didn't know I had these skills. But here I am, and I kind of surprised myself.''I used to be shy and afraid of trying new things. Now I'm very confident.''And very willing to help others. Mr. Cleary called Jennifer ''the most unselfish athlete I have ever had.''''In running, the mile is not her best event,'' he explained. ''She usually runs the mile when another player can't or doesn't want to run. She willingly runs just to earn points for the team.''Her positions -- point guard in basketball and setter in volleyball -- are both leadership roles, the coach said.As a setter, Jennifer retrieves the other team's slams and serves them up to taller teammates for kills. ''I can save anything,'' she said.No lack of confidence there. ''She's changed so much,'' Mr. Cleary said.Her brother Nick, 13 and also deaf, has noticed. ''Oh yes,'' he signs when asked if his sister has gained in confidence. ''It even seems as if she communicates more now. Even her sign language has improved.''Their shared challenges have brought the Palazzo siblings -- who moved from the Bronx two years ago -- closer together. They have not, however, dimmed sibling rivalry.Jennifer said: ''I beat him in a race every time. Every time.''Nick said: ''Usually. Usually she wins, but sometimes I do.''Their mother, Yvonne, recognizes the value of sports in their development. A single parent who works full time, she nevertheless manages to get to all their late-ending events since the Rockland County school district provides transportation back to Nanuet only up to 5 p.m.With the volleyball season winding down, Jennifer will be turning her attention to basketball. Cleary is sure of one thing.''Last year we had a senior who was very good,'' the coach said, ''and Jennifer was never able to stop her in practice. She was almost too polite. That will not happen this season.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/02/nyregion/union-thwarts-effort-to-replace-teachers-in-school-for-deaf.html", "headline": "Union Thwarts Effort to Replace Teachers in School for Deaf", "date": "2000-07-02T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 2, 2000, Section 1, Page 21Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The New York City teachers' union has thwarted a plan by the principal of the School for the Deaf to replace 35 teachers who are not proficient in American Sign Language with those who are, officials said.Martin Florsheim, the principal, told 35 teachers on Tuesday that they would be working at new schools in the fall, said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the teachers' union.Union representatives quickly intervened, tentatively negotiating the number to about 10, said Ms. Weingarten, who added that principals did not have the authority to remove tenured teachers. Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said officials were investigating the incident.Dr. Florsheim's efforts are representative of a larger debate about the education of deaf students.The average deaf 18-year-old American cannot read above the fourth-grade level. Some advocates for the deaf say the problem lies in the fact that American Sign Language, called signing, bears no relationship to English in syntax, grammar or spelling. Ms. Weingarten said last week that methods of teaching deaf students other than sign language should be explored. But proponents of sign language, like Dr. Florsheim, who is deaf, say the problem is not with sign language but with the people teaching it.The Board of Education made American Sign Language the primary language of the deaf school in 1998, after vociferous complaints from some parents about the quality of teaching there. The school, also known as Junior High School 47, runs from prekindergarten to grade 12.Barbara Fass, a deaf mother of two deaf daughters, Esther, 7, and Adele Idy, 4, was one of the complaining parents. Both children attend the school. Ms. Fass said on Friday that she was disappointed that Ms. Weingarten had prevented Dr. Florsheim from replacing the teachers.''I completely disagree with Randi Weingarten's comment that there are other methods of teaching,'' Ms. Fass wrote in response to a question. ''A.S.L. is a language, and how is that possible for her to say that there are other methods? Is she fluent in A.S.L., and if not, what right does she have?''Terri Thomson, the Queens representative on the board, spearheaded the effort to make sign language the primary language at the school.She said on Friday that though she was not familiar with what had happened on Tuesday, she was aware of continuing staffing changes to ensure that students were well educated.''At each of our public agenda meetings, a group of parents would come to testify because their children were getting poor educations,'' Ms. Thomson said. ''Some were being taught through sign language interpreters who were not teachers, and the quality was poor. We heard from students who told of failing tests. Many said they felt isolated going to school, walking around with sign language interpreters. What they cried out for was a program where they could be taught in their home language -- A.S.L.''Dr. Florsheim, the first deaf principal of the school, has mostly hired teachers fluent in sign language to his staff of 87 since becoming principal in 1996. The school, which is on East 23rd Street at Second Avenue in Manhattan, has about 300 students.American Sign Language is an important touchstone to the deaf. It had been banned from schools for more than a century in an effort to make deaf students learn and behave more like hearing children. In the late 1960's, William Stokoe Jr., a linguist at Gallaudet University, a university for the hearing-impaired in Washington, pushed for it to become recognized as a language.But now, at a time when high-technology jobs are increasingly replacing vocational jobs, and when medical technology is making it possible for deaf children to gain partial hearing through cochlear implants, some parents and educators are pushing for broader forms of communication.Another method is cued speech, which can supplement sign language. It breaks words into syllables and conveys them with hand signals and lip reading, so that a deaf person can link visual signs and sounds to the language as it is written and spoken. Others include oral-auralism, which essentially is lip reading with the help of hearing aids; signing exact English, which is using a type of sign language to depict English just as it is spoken; and auditory verbal therapy, which teaches the maximum use of hearing aids without the lip reading.''I'm exasperated by this situation,'' Ms. Weingarten said of the incident at the school. ''Here's a school designed to help kids who are deaf or hard of hearing, and one of the approaches is supposed to be A.S.L. Dr. Florsheim believes that A.S.L. is the only way. It's a good method, but it is not an exclusive method. There are some kids who will benefit from others. That is not something he understands.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/22/arts/a-children-s-adventure-in-a-deaf-world.html", "headline": "A Children's Adventure in a Deaf World", "date": "2000-04-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from April 22, 2000, Section B, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.On Monday, ''Blue's Clues,'' the Nickelodeon TV series for preschool children, will focus the adventures of its puzzle-solving puppy on a young girl who is deaf, and in the process teach its viewers a handful of words in American Sign Language.

Mr. Burns and Blue are told a story in sign language.''We wanted to teach kids sign language and show how relevant it is to their world,'' said Angela Santomero, the show's chief writer and one of its creators. Carly ''will do something like make the sign for elephant, and we show an elephant,'' she said.''It's not a one-time diversity issue,'' Ms. Santomero added. ''Our approach to education is mostly through repetition.''''Blue's Clues'' is structured as an interactive search for clues, with pauses for the young audience to figure out what Blue is doing. ''Sesame Street,'' an educational show with a different format, has long featured a deaf character who uses sign language with the Muppets.The actress Marlee Matlin, who is deaf, has recorded a series of public service announcements with Mr. Burns to promote the show's use of sign language. Mr. Burns learned American Sign Language at the Lexington Center School for the Deaf in Jackson Heights, Queens.Adele Agin, the executive director of vocational and mental health centers at Lexington, said: ''The A.S.L. is incorporated naturally into the show, with all the signs and gestures that Steve uses. It's a natural language for children because children are so visually stimulated.''''The message to deaf children is 'you're valuable; you are part of this society,' '' Ms. Agin added. ''The message to hearing children is to be open-minded, to be accepting, to be respectful to each other.Five to 10 new signs will be incorporated in each new episode of ''Blue's Clues,'' said Stacey Levin, a spokeswoman for the show. About seven signs will appear consistently in each episode, like the signs for ''Blue'' and ''thank you.''Ms. Levin said that the ongoing use of sign language, with the interactive quality of ''Blues Clues'' -- Mr. Burns speaks directly to the viewerse -- made it different from other children's programs featuring people with physical challenges.Jeffrey Bravin, the associate director of development at Lexington, said he had watched the ''Signs'' episode with his son, who is 2 1/2. Mr. Bravin is deaf, but his son can hear.''I could see his eyes pop out of his head,'' Mr. Bravin said in American Sign Language as Ms. Agin translated. ''He said, 'Daddy, I must watch it again.'

Federal District Court Judge Alfred Wolin said in October that the city was wrong in not providing the interpreter, which the city had maintained was necessary only for court proceedings.

''When all three of my children were born deaf, too,'' says Peter Artinian early in the film ''Sound and Fury,'' ''I thought, 'Great.' '' And he is not being ironic.A documentary about cochlear implants, the relatively new devices that allow many deaf people to hear, may not sound like anyone's idea of compelling filmmaking, but Josh Aronson's ''Sound and Fury'' -- which follows two branches of a Long Island family through the decision-making process about the implant's use -- is powerful, insightful, important and emotionally wrenching.The implant is a miracle, really. Most hearing people would assume that any loving parent of a hearing-impaired child would want this piece of medical technology for that child, because it would ease his or her way in the world enormously. For that reason Mr. Artinian's attitude may come as a shock.Mr. Artinian, his wife, Nita, and their three children are deaf. His daughter, Heather, decides she wants an implant. He is opposed. Chris Artinian, Peter's brother, is not deaf, but he and his wife soon learn that their newborn son is. And they very much want him to have the implant surgery. The opposing viewpoints make for painful family confrontations.''It's not intended for people to have a handicap,'' says the children's grandfather, who is not deaf, to his son, Peter, over cake and orange juice at the kitchen table. ''If I didn't know you, I would say you were an abusing parent.''The complicating factor here is deaf culture, the emotional and social bond among nonhearing people who use American Sign Language and have come to cherish their silent world as special and worth preserving. The eagerness of loved ones to jump on the cochlear implant bandwagon comes as a betrayal to some. As Peter says to his mother during a backyard get-together, ''I didn't know that you didn't accept deafness until now.''''Sound and Fury,'' which is being screened today and tomorrow as part of the 29th New Directions/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art, is asking some big questions. In a socially aware, socially sensitive culture, we profess to believe that no particular skin color, religion, sexual orientation, political ideology, chronological age or physical attribute is superior to another. We say, in fact, that differences should be celebrated; thus the corporate buzzword of the moment: diversity.Are the deaf parents in this film calling the culture's bluff? Or is a physical disadvantage truly something that should be celebrated? Do parents have a right to keep their children at a remove from the hearing world just because, in their opinion and experience, deaf is beautiful? Have we gone so far in our fear of offending anyone that we now advocate disadvantages' being deliberately preserved? Or do the hearing-impaired have a right to rear their children within a somewhat separatist subculture? The Amish have been doing that for quite a while.The most telling event in the film is Nita Artinian's change of heart. In the beginning she supports her daughter Heather's request for the implant and, in fact, wants one herself. But after Nita learns that the implant will be far less helpful to her as an adult, she changes her mind. ''We're afraid that the cochlear implant will change her identity,'' says Nita after a visit to a preschool class of children with implants.Later, in a scene between mother and daughter, Nita uses the word ''we'' in discussing the decision. Heather corrects her with ''I thought you decided.'' Nita answers: ''Don't you remember? We decided together.''SOUND AND FURYDirected by Josh Aronson; directors of photography, Brian Danitz, Kenny Gronningsater, Mead Hunt, Gordy Waterman and Brett Wiley; edited by Ann Collins; music by Mark Suozzo; produced by Roger Weisberg.

The additions, built in the early 1970's, are a gymnasium with a swimming pool and a building with classrooms and a cafeteria.But thanks to $8 million from New York State and an additional $3 million expected to be raised from private donors, a two-story academic building, designed to blend with the architecture of the old buildings, will soon rise on the 86-acre campus. The estate was acquired in 1947 and incorporated as Lutheran Friends of the Deaf but subsequently became a non-denominational state-supported school.The new 44,000-square-foot building will contain 24 classrooms, a 220-seat auditorium, a cafeteria, computer labs, therapy rooms, an art studio and a library. And for the first time, all the day school's pupils -- there are now 112, from infants through high school -- will attend class in the same building.The building, for which York Hunter is the contractor, is expected to be completed next spring.A major challenge for the architects, according to Samuel G. White of Buttrick White & Burtis, was to come up with a building whose design and size would harmonize with the existing buildings: a 40-room Tudor manor house and a complex of farm buildings (converted into offices, classrooms and storage space) that are half-timbered with stucco and have steeply pitched roofs. Thus classrooms on the second floor of the crescent-shaped new building will be contained within the multi-dormered roof, and the walls will be stucco with cast stone trim.Dr. Mark R. Prowatzke, the school's executive director, said that the new building would have indirect lighting, acoustics to accommodate students with partial hearing, and seats in the auditorium with an unimpeded view of the stage so that students have access to sign language and lip reading. ''The students participated in our groundbreaking in November,'' Dr. Prowatzke said, ''and they're very much excited about having a newer, brighter school.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/05/nyregion/on-the-job-training-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "On-the-Job Training for the Deaf", "date": "2000-03-05T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from March 5, 2000, Section WC, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.ANTHONY CARABELLO is personable, industrious and well liked by his colleagues at the Rye Town Hilton, where he was recently named Employee of the Month. He is also deaf.Mr. Carabello, 22, is a steward, responsible for cleaning certain areas of the hotel, primarily the kitchen. He joined the hotel in 1996 as part of the first group of vocational students to participate in an internship program with the New York School for the Deaf in White Plains. Working with job coaches and hotel staff members, students learn different aspects of the hotel industry.''We approached the Rye Town Hilton for this particular internship because hotels are like microcosms of the real world,'' said Shelly Delman, the chairwoman of the school's vocational program.When Ms. Delman met Susan Marano, the hotel's director of sales at a School-to-Work Partnership meeting, they explored possibilities for a joint program. Ms. Marano then brought the project to the attention of the Hilton's general manager, Ernst Rectermann.''It's a chance to make a difference,'' Ms. Marano said. ''We can't help every good cause, but education is something we can do, and give it 100 percent.'' Since the program's inception, 20 students have interned in various departments in the hotel.''The aim is to give them hands-on experience in different jobs so they will get a sense of what is required from employees,'' said Karen McKudden, the job coach who is the liaison between the students and the hotel staff. She is always at the hotel when students are working to act as an interpreter and assist the hotel staff.''Communication problems are resolved faster on the job than we anticipated,'' she said, adding that many hotel employees are learning sign language.Finding the right job for each student is crucial, Ms. McKudden said.Menalu Negatu is a prime example. Ms. Negatu, 20, a native of Ethiopia, is creative and artistic, Ms. McKudden said.''She has interned in various departments, including housekeeping, but since December she has been working in the kitchen, carving vegetables into floral garnishes,'' Ms. McKudden said. ''It has been a wonderfully exciting experience for her and will help prepare her for a good job when she graduates from night school.''In a telephone interview with the help of Ms. McKudden, Ms. Negatu said she would love to stay in her job permanently.''I carve tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots and small potatoes into flowers. I like seeing the end results. It is very satisfying for me to be doing such creative work,'' she said. ''The people in the kitchen are very good to work with, and I feel they like me, which is very nice. I like this work much more than housekeeping, and I would love to have this as a career after I graduate a year from now.''Two former interns, Mr. Carabello and Erick Martin, are now full-time employees, earning union wages.As the program enters its fourth year, school officials say they could not be more pleased. ''It has been spectacular,'' Ms. Delman said. ''Seeing young adults who have spent a lifetime as dependents becoming independent, productive, tax-paying adults is really wonderful.''The partnership has been a boon for the hotel as well, Ms. Marano said. ''Working with deaf students has raised the awareness of our staff to their special needs: many have learned the basics of communicating in sign language.''And in a tight job market, Shamara Singh, director of human resources, said that good employees are hard to find. ''Anthony and Erick are terrific workers, and their attendance record is hard to beat,'' she said. ''They are almost never late or absent, and they are very popular with their co-workers.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/16/nyregion/where-the-deaf-are-prepared-for-life-in-the-outside-world.html", "headline": "Where the Deaf Are Prepared For Life in the Outside World", "date": "2000-01-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from January 16, 2000, Section WC, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.POISED and ready for the world, the well-groomed young woman sat in the busy cafeteria amid fellow students, animatedly telling about her hopes after she graduates from high school in June.''I'm planning to go to college,'' Janell Wagstaff, 18, of New Rochelle said, mentioning several schools she is considering. ''I'm just not sure yet.''Nor could she say what she wanted to be: ''I'd like to be a writer, a psychologist or possibly a pediatrician.''But she was certain of one thing. ''I'm prepared for the outside world,'' she said in sign language in the busy lunchroom of the New York School for the Deaf here.It is a preparation on which the 3-year-old twins Valerie and Victoria Morel of Washingtonville, N.Y., are just embarking. They, too, are attending the nation's second oldest learning institution for the deaf, which offers 158 students a complete education from prekindergarten through high school as well as a program for infants.''I think the school is great,'' said Berkis Morel, the mother of the twins. ''They understand how the children feel. The kids are so happy to go to school every morning, they just jump on the bus. And they learn so much. Plus the school is wonderful with the parents.''That is the School for the Deaf's first challenge, said Jamie Chester, who teaches in its infants' program.''Training parents how to work with children early and telling them what is available is so important,'' she said. ''Parents start devastated, perhaps not even wanting to face that their child has special needs. But after six or seven months, they see their children communicating, speaking. It's a most exciting thing.''Mrs. Morel, who like her husband, Carlo, a New York City police officer, was born in the Dominican Republic, knows the feelings.''At first I didn't notice anything wrong,'' Mrs. Morel said. She and her husband have two older children without hearing problems. ''The girls were so bright, so artistic. And I believe they lost their hearing progressively.''They were about 10 months old and my mother was baby-sitting when she noticed they didn't come when she called them. And they kept fighting to turn the television set louder.''At the age of 1 came the diagnosis: severe to profound hearing loss. Not reversible.''Everything was so overwhelming,'' Mrs. Morel said. ''It was really hard to accept it. I was crying all night. I couldn't talk to anyone for days. At dinner, I would look at them and burst out crying. I couldn't believe I would never hear them say, 'Mommy, pass me the milk.'''Then a woman from the New York School for the Deaf visited our house regularly for a year, and we got into the infancy program.''Now the family is learning American Sign Language. ''My older daughter goes to classes one day a week,'' Mrs. Morel said, ''and my husband carries a sign dictionary with him. And our girls are going to go to college. Education is so important.''And Mrs. Morel?''I'm much better now,'' she said. ''I'm glad it's just that. I have two bright, happy little girls. And I'm going to be trilingual.''Carlo Morel agreed. ''My girls can do everything,'' he said. ''They just can't hear.''But they can and will communicate, long before they join the rest of their high school senior class in planting the traditional class tree on the School for the Deaf's sprawling 77-acre campus. It is a campus with dormitories that house 20 percent of the student body during the school week and where an approach of ''total communication,'' speaking and signing, is followed.Susan Murray, the school's principal, had worked with the deaf before working on policy for special education for the federal government. She came to the school, she said, because she ''missed the satisfaction of working with deaf children.''''We have a strong literacy program here,'' she said. ''Reading and writing are particularly important for deaf children. We get them familiar with print from early on. We try to instill in them an interest in reading, give them all the skills for total communication.''Which, of course, includes American Sign Language, a fully structured language of finger and hand movements. From the infancy program on, communication through signing is integral to the visually oriented classroom.Early training is crucial for hearing-impaired youngsters, Ms. Murray said. The training can be intense, which is why the school enlists 35 teachers and 28 teaching assistants to work with its 158 students.At the prekindergarten level, the instruction is almost one-to-one. Walk into the class, be greeted by a hug from 3-year-old TySheen Jordan, one of the five students in the class. With one of them in a speech therapy session, that leaves one teacher and two assistants for four youngsters. All the youngsters are playing individually, watching a teacher or an assistant teacher sign to them about their particular toy or activity and then quickly moving on to something else. ''Kids have a short attention span at this age,'' Ms. Murray said. ''We try to keep them focused on developmental skills.''As the children grow, there is more structure and more academic challenge. Math. Science. Literature. Music.On the bulletin board in the office of Cathy Milliren, the assistant principal, are charts of the New York State Learning Standards for schools.''We have an accredited high school here,'' she said, ''everything that any high school has.''And that includes sports teams. The 1997-98 track squad swept all 44 events in its 7 meets. The basketball team has surprised some of the public and private schools on its schedule.The basketball coach, John Diehl, who is deaf and signs his instructions to his players, said: ''At first opponents are nervous against us. Then they see we can play pretty well. After that, it's like any other game. They might tell us 'good game' at the end.''In the spring, a professional dancer often works with the younger children.''They can't hear but they can feel the beat,'' said Ms. Milliren, observing that boom boxes abound on the campus.For music and dancing, wooden floors are a help, permitting the students to feel the rhythms.Kim McCormack is the school's artist in residence, a broad category that includes inventions and learning to work with and manipulate machines. She is always amazed, she said, at how sharp the students' other senses are.''The understanding of drawing in perspective is way beyond their age,'' Ms. McCormack said. ''A youngster put a swing set in a drawing behind kids playing, and it was in the proper perspective.''The annual Invention Convention further expands horizons, as does the student body's cultural diversity. ''We have Spanish with A.S.L. and Cantonese with A.S.L. being used here,'' Ms. McCormack said.Albert T. Pimentel, who is deaf, is in his fourth year as headmaster of the School for the Deaf, which was founded in Manhattan in 1817 and moved to White Plains in 1938. ''What's so special here?'' he asked, speaking in a clear, strong, unaccented voice. ''Our education program.''When William Hurt was preparing for his screen role as a teacher who falls in love with a deaf woman in ''Children of a Lesser God,'' he took up temporary residence on campus.Stephen Clark, a high school freshman from Tarrytown, has been at the school for four years. ''Was I nervous when I came here? Yes,'' he conveyed with dextrous signing movements. ''Not now. Here we have a camaraderie that helps us prepare for anything.''Including dating. ''I have a boyfriend,'' Aileen Dawn Harkins of Kingston, N.Y., signed in answer to a question, blushing as any teenager might.Miss Harkins is 18 and college bound with a scholarship. She is looking forward to graduation. So is Ms. Murray. ''Graduation Day is very emotional here,'' Ms. Murray said, ''seeing what they leave us with.''Marlene Roque, a 20-year-old senior from Manhattan, is in the 50 percent of the student body that goes on to higher education. ''My mother is so proud,'' she signed. ''I'm the first one in my family going to college.''Funds for ReadingThe New York School for the Deaf has been awarded a $20,000 grant to establish the Reading Connection, a pioneering program through which tutors will visit the homes of children as young as 2 to teach parents how to read with their youngsters using American Sign Language.Initially, 15 families from the school's infant and prekindergarten programs have been selected. Funds are being supplied by the Reader's Digest Foundation.''We're really excited,'' Susan Murray, the school principal, said of the grant. ''Parents know they should read with their children, but many don't know how.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/19/nyregion/on-the-map-help-and-understanding-for-those-who-are-deaf-and-addicted.html", "headline": "Help and Understanding for Those Who Are Deaf and Addicted", "date": "1999-12-19T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "In a three-story brick building, on the grounds of the Carrier Foundation in Belle Mead, the Halfway Home Project is a long-term residential treatment program for deaf and other hearing-impaired alcoholics and drug addicts. The Halfway Home Project, operated through the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf, and two similar programs in California are said to be the only such treatment programs in the country. Supported by the state Department of Health and Senior Services and by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's New Jersey Health Initiatives Program, the project has been in operation for a little more than a year.Keven Poore, the program coordinator, is one of only a handful of certified drug and alcohol counselors who are deaf. Speaking through a sign language interpreter, Mr. Poore talked recently about the Halfway Home Project.Q. Why is a such a program needed?A. Deaf people who are alcoholics and drug addicts face extra challenges. It is harder for them to break down and ask for help, and, when they do, there are very few places for them to be referred. The number of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for the deaf are minuscule, so the next best thing is meetings where there is a sign language interpreter and there are not very many of them. Usually there is no one at a meeting who knows sign language except the interpreter, so the deaf and hard of hearing addict has extreme difficulty talking to other people there. Being able to talk and share experiences is crucial to recovery.Q. Who comes to Halfway Home?A. At first we took people from anyplace, but now it is limited to just New Jersey residents. We have room for 10 people at a time. Right now we have seven. It is good if a person has completed a 30-day treatment program. He or she cannot have any medical needs that require special care and cannot be in danger of experiencing withdrawal symptoms. They have to go through an evaluation process. We have not been in operation long enough yet to know what our success rate will be for those who are accepted and complete the program.Q. What do they do while they are at Halfway Home?A. They attend counseling, lectures, independent living skills classes and go to regular Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous meetings that have interpreters. They have to help in the house, doing the cooking and helping to run the house. After a few weeks they are expected to get a job in the community so that they learn to cope with a job and learn to deal with people as newly sober individuals. They contribute some to their upkeep, although no one pays what it really costs. A lot of these people have lost everything before they came into treatment -- their jobs, their families and their homes. They have to learn how to get that back again.Q. How is the program different from a rehabilitation program for hearing people?A. Deaf people frequently have a lower than average reading level; many are at a third or fourth grade level. So there is less reliance on written materials. Deaf people are visually oriented so there is a lot of role playing and use of drawing. All of the counselors and counselors' aides, and there are about 12 people total on staff, are proficient in sign language as well as in treatment for addicts. Deaf people grow up facing more obstacles because most grow up in a hearing family and are unable to communicate with others who have had similar experiences as addicts. At the same time, we have to make sure they are not using that as an excuse to not work on their sobriety.

And soon, there it is: Paulsboro 16; Bellmawr 24; Ewing 72.Not what was in mind. Was a president born in Bellmawr? Is there a stadium in Paulsboro? Does Ewing have a big art museum?Not that there is anything wrong with these towns. Paulsboro, for instance, is home to a perennial high school wrestling powerhouse; the College of New Jersey campus is in Ewing. Yet chances are people on the road want to know how far it is to Camden or Trenton or Princeton or Jersey City, all just off I-295, or the New Jersey Turnpike, to which it connects. They wont get any help from this or many other mileage signs on the state's major roads.It is all part of a sort of literal interpretation by the state Department of Transportation. The department had long been criticized for not having many mileage signs at all, so over the last several years, it has been placing more of them on state and federal roads. The problem is that the signs mainly mention only towns directly on the road.In the case of the sign at the foot of I-295, Paulsboro is the first town of any size a driver comes to on the highway. Bellmawr is the town where I-295 connects with state Route 42, which leads to the Atlantic City Expressway. And Ewing, just north of Trenton, is where I-295 officially ends. Though there is no interruption in the road, it changes its designation at Ewing to Interstate 95.''We're not trying to deceive anyone or to lead anyone away from the cities,'' said John Dourgarian, a spokesman for the state Department of Transportation. ''What we wanted to do is make sure everything corresponds to the official state map. If drivers have the state map, then these towns and these major intersections will be obvious.''Of course, one might ask, if you had the official state map in hand, would mileage signs be needed in the first place? But a visitor might still want to know how far it is to the major cities or tourist sites.A driver can forget about that, too, if coming into the state from Philadelphia. At the beginning of state Route 70 in Pennsauken, soon after crossing the Delaware River on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, there is a sign reading: Medford 12; Whiting 38; Brielle 58. So while a driver may want to know how far away mega-suburb Cherry Hill is along Route 70, or maybe the distance to some Shore points, he instead learns where Route 70 crosses Burlington County 541 (Medford), where it crosses County 539 (Whiting) and where it terminates (Brielle).''Over the last five years, we've been trying to update and standardize our signs, especially on newer roads or where there are new intersections,'' Mr. Dourgarian said. ''It's not arbitrary and we've left some of the older signs where they are appropriate.''In fact, when traveling east on Route 70, a driver will see some of those older signs, updating at appropriate intervals the distances not to Whiting and Medford, but to Camden and Philadelphia. But approaching Trenton on State Routes 129/29, an upgraded road with new intersections, a driver won't find how far she is from the capital, but will see a sign reading: Lambertville 17; Frenchtown 33.These new signs could be material for a New Jersey geography lesson, or perhaps even bring a little tourist boom to some of these smaller towns. For instance, several mileage signs on southbound Interstate 295 give the mileage to Pennsville, a working-class town of about 12,000 and the terminus of I-295.Pennsville's Web site (www.pennsville.org) touts the Church Landing Farmhouse Museum, a restored working farm from 1860, and restaurants that include Gus's Pizzeria on South Broadway and the Riverview Inn overlooking the Delaware.''I haven't heard of a person coming in here yet because of the signs,'' said Lori Maahs, Pennsville's deputy clerk.

In turn, 12 Woodlands students are meeting their foreign language requirements by studying American Sign Language taught by an instructor from Shannon's school.At first glance, it appears to be a simple exchange program.But nothing is simple in the debate about how -- and whether -- the worlds of the deaf and the worlds of the hearing should intersect. Particularly complicated are questions about putting deaf students in traditional classrooms, a practice known as mainstreaming.''We are rethinking some basic principles,'' said Albert T. Pimentel, headmaster of the state-supported private School for the Deaf, also known as the Fanwood School, which this year has 162 students in pre-school through 12th grade.After decades of trial and error there are examples of mainstreaming working, he said, and of occasions when it fails.''Sometimes even though you make an effort to integrate a student in the physical sense in a normal classroom, he or she remains isolated emotionally,'' he said.Fanwood students can participate in activities and classes at Woodlands, but the program remains optional, in part because some students did not thrive when put in a full-time public school classroom have not thrived. Public schools ''often make a lot of assumptions in trying to get students to adjust to their world,'' he said.Students at Fanwood are sent there by their school districts, which must first decide that they are unable to meet a student's needs. The New York State Education Department requires that students have a hearing loss of at least 80 decibels in the better ear to be considered for admission to the school, which has students from more than 70 districts. Statewide tests aimed at setting stricter standards for all students have put new pressures on those who educate the deaf. According to state figures, about 0.17 percent of all students in the state in 1998 were deaf -- 1,922 out of 3.3 million in New York that year. Rita D. Levay, manager of special education policy for the state's Office of Vocational Education Service for Individuals With Disabilities, which provided the figures, explained that the state classifies deafness as a disability.Susan K. Murray, principal of the New York School for the Deaf, explained that while some educators were seeking to lower the bar, others were concerned that ''if we make too many accommodations for deaf students, we will accommodate them right out of achieving their potential.''Fourth graders at the School for the Deaf took the new English Language Arts tests, and the test results were released late last month. It was the first time that students in special education schools and resource rooms in regular schools had to take such a test and have their performance included in the official tallies.At the New York School for the Deaf, all eight fourth graders scored below state minimum standards. Countywide, 39 percent failed to meet the standards and were said to need extra help to meet tough new graduation standards.Merryl H. Tisch, a member of the New York State Board of Regents who focuses on issues of disabilities, said that the state last week agreed to give special education students more time to meet the standards. ''We need to spend the next couple of years gathering data and thinking about ways to bring this group up to standards,'' she said. ''It relieves the short-term pressure and gives us time to prepare.''But in the longer run, she said, the state expects to demand similar performance from many -- although not all -- special education students. ''Not only are we asking that most special students be able to sit next to their peers,'' she said, referring to mainstreaming goals, ''but we're asking them to achieve at the same level; no longer can we ignore their academic potential.''James F. Petrichko, an 18-year-old student at the school for the deaf, has experienced both sides of the education world and wants nothing more to do with mainstreaming.He had been in nine different schools by the time he dropped out last year, frustrated that he had to adjust to a hearing world -- ''and never the other way around.'' Educators labeled him a behavior problem, saying he was argumentative with peers, sullen and uncooperative with speech teachers, while scoring below average on tests.''Yeah, I was emotional and didn't get along,'' James agreed, ''but all the kids would be talking, and I was left out.''Even though James enjoyed athletics, he was never accepted on the basketball, track or soccer teams at North Rockland High School, his ninth school placement at that time. The only place he said he felt welcomed in his early teen years was on the streets of downtown Haverstraw, near where he lived.At Fanwood, he has since learned American Sign Language and made friends.Other students have had more success with mainstreaming.For Shannon Weese, who said she hopes to become an actress, the modified mainstreaming program at Woodlands High has provided her with one of her first experiences in socializing with peers who are hearing. ''It was awkward, and I was afraid at first,'' she said, ''but I wanted it.''In a joint production of ''Oliver!'' this school year, the student playing Oliver sang ''Who Will Buy This Wonderful Morning?'' while Shannon signed. Then the cast joined in, signing as she had taught them to.Besides signing, Shannon communicates with her hearing friends using E-mail and special phone hookups.Next year, three deaf students will be studying calculus, chemistry and child psychology at Woodlands.In contrast to so-called full inclusionists, who advocate a one-size-fits-all philosophy regarding school placement and say that the deaf culture should adapt to the hearing culture, educators like Oscar P. Cohen, Superintendent of the Lexington School for the Deaf in Queens, take a different tack. ''Most children attending our school for the deaf don't want to be the 12th player on an 11-member team,'' he said recently. ''They want to be one of the 11.''Mr. Cohen continued: ''Throughout the country in schools for the deaf, student governments, school newspapers and yearbook squads, interscholastic athletic teams, mock-trial clubs and academic honor rolls are composed of deaf students as bona fide participants, not honorary members. What's right for one student may be wrong for another.''In recent years, pride and political awareness among deaf students has led them to step up efforts to develop a separate cultural identity, said Janell N. Wagstaff, 18. A student at Fanwood since she was 5, Ms. Wagstaff is now the vice president of its student body government.Like Ms. Wagstaff, an increasing number of deaf people have said that they would not choose to be among those who do hear, and to these deaf people the word ''cure'' -- the whole notion of deafness as pathology -- is anathema.She used as an example, permanent cochlear implants, which enable some deaf students to hear at least some sounds. Many deaf people, however, refer to the wired implants as bionic ears, saying that ''the implication is we need to get fixed.''''We should feel good about ourselves the way we are,'' Ms. Wagstaff said. ''As deaf adults, we too can be successes, with our own heroes and heroines.''But even as deaf people espouse the concept of separateness, many also seek a relationship with the hearing world.John MacLean, an English teacher at Woodlands, said that when deaf students from Fanwood first attended classes a decade ago at Woodlands, the public school in Greenburgh, there was rarely any interaction between the two cultures, but now the barriers are being crossed.''We have gone out to eat together and spent weekends in each other's homes,'' he explained. ''The students attended proms at each other's schools.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/17/nyregion/judge-finds-bias-at-hospital-in-dealings-with-deaf-man.html", "headline": "Judge Finds Bias at Hospital In Dealings With Deaf Man", "date": "1999-04-17T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from April 17, 1999, Section B, Page 4Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Mount Sinai Medical Center illegally discriminated against the deaf husband of a pregnant woman by refusing to provide a sign language interpreter while the couple were attending Lamaze classes, a Federal judge has ruled.As a result of the hospital's refusal, Jeffrey Bravin, a teacher at the Lexington School for the Deaf in Manhattan, was unable to learn the Lamaze method of assisting a woman giving birth, Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court in Manhattan said in his opinion on Wednesday. Mr. Bravin's wife, Naomi, needed a birthing partner to take part in the classes and to learn the techniques being taught, the judge wrote.The hospital did not provide interpreters during the birth or the week after, when the Bravins' newborn son, Ethan Raymond, was being treated for low blood sugar in Mount Sinai's neonatal intensive care unit.''The essence of Lamaze is team effort,'' said Alan J. Rich, the lawyer for the Bravins, who now live in South Hempstead, N.Y., but were living in New York City in 1997, when Mrs. Bravin was pregnant.The birth, Mr. Rich said, was like a ''Marx Brothers movie,'' with Mrs. Bravin ''trying to interpret between contractions,'' to explain what Mr. Bravin was supposed to be doing.Early in 1997, when the Bravins first requested an interpreter for the Lamaze classes, the hospital turned them down, according to court papers. Mr. Bravin obtained a letter from the United States Department of Health and Human Services stating that they had a legal right to an interpreter, but the hospital disagreed, saying that Mrs. Bravin, who can hear, was the patient, not her husband, court papers said.Laura Alfredo, one of Mount Sinai's lawyers, said she had not yet seen the decision and would not comment.The judge said that the hospital violated state and Federal laws requiring accommodations for the disabled, but rejected the class-action claim of the Bravins and the Civic Association of the Deaf of New York City, a watchdog group on the legal rights of the deaf.Though the lawsuit focuses on the Lamaze classes, the Bravins were more upset when the hospital refused to provide an interpreter during the birth and the week that their baby was in the neonatal intensive care unit.''My wife is hearing, but she has been so upset at what has been happening to our baby that she cannot interpret,'' Mr. Bravin wrote in an affidavit on Sept. 19, attempting to obtain a court order to force the hospital to provide an interpreter. ''She has been crying. I want to speak directly with those in charge of my baby's case.''''I am, naturally, like any other parent, concerned about the well being of my baby, but especially here, my baby is in an intensive care unit,'' Mr. Bravin said.The judge, after ruling in favor of the Bravins, scheduled the decision on the amount of damages for next month."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/18/nyregion/for-deaf-mexicans-freedom-after-slavery-and-detention.html", "headline": "For Deaf Mexicans, Freedom After Slavery and Detention", "date": "1998-07-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 18, 1998, Section B, Page 6Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The lawyers are calling the timing a coincidence. The victims call it fate. Exactly one year after they shocked New Yorkers with their stories of virtual enslavement at the hands of greedy bosses, 37 deaf Mexicans and their 6 children will get their first taste of freedom in this country tomorrow when they walk out of the hotel where they have been held for 365 days under the watchful eyes of armed immigration guards.The Mexicans, who were forced to sell trinkets for years in the city's subways and airports, will move from the drab Westway Motor Inn in Astoria, Queens, to a recently renovated city shelter in East New York, Brooklyn. They will be the only occupants of the shelter, a three-story house with a courtyard and a garden, where they will have private rooms and all the amenities of modern life.The move represents the beginning of their journey to a normal life in the United States. As of tomorrow afternoon, they will no longer be under the care of Federal officials, and their movements will not be restricted. Instead, they will be under the care of the City of New York, and they will be free to go wherever they want, bound only by the shelter's curfew.Because they received work permits yesterday, they will be allowed to work. And, because the city has offered to pick up the tab for their training and education, they will have a battery of teachers, social workers, mental health workers and interpreters at their disposal. Lights will flash inside their rooms when someone is at the door; devices will make their beds shake when their children cry for them at night; other lights will alert them in the event of fires or other emergencies.The workers were kept in the hotel while the criminal case against their tormentors proceeded in Federal court for two reasons: they were in the country illegally, and they were needed as witnesses for the prosecution. It took exactly 11 months to close the case. In the end, 18 men and women pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison in the United States or deported to Mexico.Some of their victims -- 13 adults and their 4 children -- chose to return to Mexico earlier this week. Two more adults will return in about a month. The remaining 35 adults and 6 children will stay. They are waiting for special visas granted to people who make significant contributions to criminal cases.Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman in the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, said that the workers toured their new home yesterday and that they were ''dancing with joy.'' She said the city had not yet determined how much money it would invest in the workers' welfare. Earlier, city officials had said the budget was $1 million.Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was one of the first public officials to come to the defense of the Mexicans when they were found living in two crammed houses in Jackson Heights, Queens, last year. Their stories -- of 12-hour working days and abusive bosses who denied them food and tortured them with a stun gun when they did not make enough money -- shocked the city and the nation.Scott A. Rosenberg, a Legal Aid lawyer who represents the workers, said that public officials, including the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, have been quick to offer aid to the workers in part because they recognize that the laws of the United States had contributed to their years of enslavement.''I think the city and the I.N.S. feel an enormous sense of responsibility,'' Mr. Rosenberg said, ''and they are willing to do whatever it takes now, not only because these people are serious victims of a crime but because they recognize that it went on for so long as it did because our laws discourage immigrants from going to the police.''In interviews on Thursday, several workers said they had often thought of going to the police but did not because they feared deportation.Yesterday, while they packed their belongings -- boxes of donated clothing and stuffed animals -- they were overjoyed, Mr. Rosenberg said. ''They are eager to get on with the rest of their lives.''Curiously, none of the deaf Mexicans have expressed the desire to do some of the things that people who have been detained for a long time usually want to do upon release, like go to the movies or take a walk in a park. Instead, they talk only about studying and finding jobs.''I guess,'' Mr. Rosenberg said, ''you can lose perspective when you have been locked up as long as they have.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/nyregion/enslaved-deaf-mexicans-tell-of-life-in-city-shadows.html", "headline": "Enslaved Deaf Mexicans Tell of Life in City Shadows", "date": "1998-07-17T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 17, 1998, Section B, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The first time he was handed a backpack full of pencils and ordered to sell them for $1 each in the subways of New York, Jesus Barraza understood he had been lied to.Mr. Barraza, deaf and illiterate, had come to the United States in 1994, enticed by tales of riches from a woman he had known since childhood in Mazatlan, a city in western Mexico. The woman, Rosa Maria Beltran-Sanchez, handed him a fake passport and told him that in New York he would find work as an electrician.Instead, he became a virtual slave of bosses who smuggled dozens of deaf Mexicans into the United States, putting them to work selling trinkets in the subways and airports of New York, Chicago, Boston and other cities.Their story became public a year ago this Sunday when three men and a woman walked into a police station in Jackson Heights, Queens and, using signs and written messages, revealed a tale of abuse and enslavement that shocked the city and attracted national attention.Since then they have been kept by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in a motel in Astoria, Queens, the details of their ordeal revealed only in the formalities of criminal prosecutions. Now, after 18 of their bosses have pleaded guilty and have been sentenced or deported to Mexico, the Mexican workers have begun to tell their stories.In interviews conducted yesterday with the help of sign-language interpreters, several of the immigrants described living in crowded houses, watched by abusive, greedy bosses, who punished them if they did not make enough money.Mr. Barraza said he turned over as much as $200 to his bosses when he returned from a 12-hour day in the subways but was never given money to buy milk or pampers for his 2-year-old son. Ms. Beltran-Sanchez, who was the boss in the house where he lived, gave him one diaper a day for his child and allowed him to borrow milk from her own children, but only if he pleaded.Otherwise, Mr. Barraza would go to the corner bodega to buy diapers and baby food on credit, he said. He paid off his tab with the tips he accumulated from subway riders who gave him more than the $1 price of the trinkets. He said he felt the payment for the pencils belonged to his bosses, who were supposedly saving it for him and the others to help their relatives in Mexico.''I would never steal from anyone,'' he said. ''It was very obvious that the money was not mine to keep.''And if he did, he knew there would be consequences. Mr. Barraza, tall and muscular, said that when he dared to ask for food, he was punched and slapped on the head by Ms. Beltran-Sanchez and once even threatened with a knife.He said he put up with the long, miserable hours in the subway cars, the lies and beatings because he had nowhere to run to and he feared deportation.''I thought about leaving a couple of times,'' he said yesterday through an interpreter. ''But where was I going to go? I didn't know anyone.''And so he stayed for 41 months.A year later, the images haunt him. He said he saw one of the bosses beat another immigrant repeatedly, until his boyish face had become a maze of a scars. He slept with his wife and son on the top of a bunk bed and many nights all three went to bed hungry. Often, too depressed and tired to work, he walked the streets of Queens waiting for nightfall. On those nights, when he returned and his bosses realized he had not made any money, he was denied food.Ricardo Gonzalez, 26, lived in another house run by a different set of bosses, who had their own ideas about punishment. When Mr. Gonzalez did not sell enough trinkets, he was sent into a room by himself and forced to assemble thousands of keychains to be sold the next day.But, he said, there were more horrific moments.''The worst,'' he said, ''is when I saw them beat the children.''Mr. Gonzalez said the bosses, who were deaf themselves, often slapped crying infants and forced spoonfuls of food into the mouths of finicky toddlers who did not want to eat.He said he often thought of going to the police but feared that his bosses and their friends, here and in Mexico, would eventually find out and have him killed.''I'm very happy that the police came when they did,'' he said yesterday. ''I never thought they would come. To this day, I don't know who did it. It may have been one of us, or it may have been a neighbor. I have no idea who did it, but I'm thankful they did it.''In fact, the people who went to the police were two workers, accompanied by an elderly couple who were not connected to the group in Queens.One of the workers who alerted the police said in an interview yesterday that he decided to seek help because his bosses had started to abuse him mentally as well as physically. He agreed to tell his story for the first time on the condition that his name not be used.He said that last year, after more than three years of hard work, he thought he deserved a vacation and his bosses had promised him one. He was told he would be going to Florida in July with eight co-workers.But when the time came to pack, his bosses told him that they had changed their minds and he would not be going. That made him angry enough to walk into a police station house that same night and alert the police to what was going on.''They broke their promise to me,'' he said, anger still reflected in his desperate and quick signing. ''They made me work hard for months, promising that we would all enjoy a vacation and then they shut me out of it.''When he decided to go to the police, he told a fellow worker. Together, they went to Newark International Airport where they sought out an elderly, deaf woman from New Jersey, whom they had met while working at the airport. The woman, a peddler born in the United States, was sympathetic to their plight and told the men they should not have to turn over the profits to their bosses.She and her husband accompanied them to the houses in Queens where they lived, and, seeing the crowded conditions, agreed to go with them to the police. The worker said yesterday that he never knew the name of the couple, referring to the woman only by what he called ''her deaf name'' -- a sign across the left cheek with his left pinky.The worker said he came to the United States thinking that he would lead a better life. He had lost his job as a fisherman in Mexico and, following the advice of friends, took the fake passport they offered and crossed into the United States. He said the border patrol officer never asked to see his documents, though.A few days later, accompanied by three of the bosses who had recruited him, he arrived in New York. Within days, he was taken to the subway, handed a bag of trinkets and told to begin selling. ''I was deeply humiliated,'' he said. ''I thought peddling trinkets was like begging. That's not what I came here for.''The man and 34 other workers, who still remain in the motel, have asked for permission to stay in the country; 14 of their fellow workers voluntarily returned to Mexico earlier this week. Immigration officials have agreed to sponsor the workers still here for a special visa granted to witnesses who contribute to the prosecution of criminal cases. Today, they will receive work permits and will soon move to housing provided by the city.Mr. Barraza has already decided what kind of work he would like to do. He wants to work at a factory putting together television sets or in a hospital, waxing the floors.''Operating that big machine, you know,'' he said with a grin. ''I think I'd like that.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/20/nyregion/us-permits-deaf-mexicans-forced-to-peddle-to-remain.html", "headline": "U.S. Permits Deaf Mexicans, Forced to Peddle, to Remain", "date": "1998-06-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from June 20, 1998, Section A, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The 49 deaf Mexican men and women whose ordeal as virtual slaves in a quiet Queens neighborhood shocked New York and attracted national attention last year will be allowed to stay in the United States, Federal officials said yesterday.The illegal immigrants, who were forced to peddle trinkets in the subway and turn over their earnings to bosses who beat and abused them, will be permitted to remain because of their help in convicting their tormentors, officials said.The news came as the Federal criminal case against the men and women who victimized them ended yesterday with the sentencing of the last of 18 bosses. That boss, Agustin Rodriguez-Torres, was sentenced to the time he has already served, 10 months, for crimes including conspiracy to commit slavery and harboring illegal aliens.Officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said the deaf Mexicans and their 11 children, who have been held under the agency's custody at a motel in Queens for almost a year, would be released within 30 days. Then, city officials said, they will be allowed to stay in city-owned housing in Brooklyn for as long as they need to, and will be free to go wherever they choose. The city has reserved $1 million for their care, said Jerome M. Hauer, the director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.Mike Wishnie, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the detainees, said he was relieved to hear that the Government did not intend to deport them. ''They are excited that the case is over and the bosses who oppressed them are going to jail,'' he said. ''At the same time, they are anxious to leave the hotel and begin new lives in the United States.''It was unclear how the Mexicans might make a living, but Mr. Wishnie and city officials said several nonprofit organizations were willing to pay for whatever training they need to become self-sufficient. Other organizations are prepared to help them apply for Federal welfare benefits and health care.''They will be clothed, fed, their children will go to school,'' Mr. Hauer said. ''The Mayor has repeatedly said he is committed to help them, and we will.''A spokesman for the immigration agency, Russell A. Bergeron Jr., said the workers would be allowed to apply for a special visa granted to people who contribute significantly to a criminal investigation. Although the workers do not have the visas yet, ''it is highly unlikely any of them will be denied,'' Mr. Bergeron said. Those who want to return to Mexico will be free to do so as soon as travel can be arranged, he added.Mr. Wishnie said 10 to 15 of the workers, including a woman who has not seen her two sons for years, want to go home. But many are worried about going back to Mexico, he said, because they fear retaliation from the families of the men and women they helped convict.Citing concerns over the nature of their status, their lawyers did not allow reporters to interview them yesterday.The end of the criminal case came 11 months from the day when four deaf Mexican immigrants walked into a police station in Elmhurst, Queens, and handed an officer a note asking for help. An investigation revealed that the immigrants were part of a larger group of laborers who had been smuggled into the country and forced to work up to 20 hours a day selling trinkets for $1 in the subways. They were living in two cramped apartments in Queens and sleeping on the floor. If they did not earn enough money for their bosses, they were beaten and starved.Twenty people were indicted. Two remain in a Mexican jail awaiting trial and 18 pleaded guilty in the United States.Prosecutors said Mr. Rodriguez-Torres, who was sentenced yesterday, was an enforcer who beat the workers and held them down while the ringleaders shocked them with stun guns. His sentence was lenient, though, because Mr. Rodriguez-Torres never initiated the violence himself, prosecutors said, and because he cooperated with the Government from the start. He said in court yesterday that he was sorry for what he had done and that he wanted to go home.As he spoke, about 45 of his victims watched from three benches at the front of Judge Nina Gershon's courtroom. They looked sober and transfixed, with their eyes moving from the judge to the sign language interpreter translating the proceedings. Only after the session was over did they smile. Several wept quietly.The other 17 bosses had been sentenced earlier this year to jail terms that ranged from 14 years for Adriana Paoletti, the woman considered the ringleader, to 5 years of probation for Frank Coenen, who was charged with conspiracy to commit slavery but cooperated with the authorities.''We're satisfied with the job we did, that the sentences were fair and that justice was served,'' said an assistant United States attorney, Sandy Cohen, a prosecutor in the case. Mr. Cohen said his office was seeking to extradite the two bosses still in Mexico.Days after the workers were found in the houses in Queens, similar cases of abuse against deaf Mexicans were discovered in North Carolina and in Chicago. Mr. Bergeron said the workers who had been victimized in North Carolina had all chosen to return home, but he did not know the status of the victims in Chicago.While the New York case wended its way through the courts, the workers and their 11 children -- one was born last week, the fourth born in custody -- were held at the Westway Motor Inn in Astoria, Queens, on the ground that they had entered the country illegally and were witnesses in a criminal case. They filled their hours making arts and crafts, watching Spanish-language soap operas and playing board games. Their view from their rooms was an expressway that leads to La Guardia Airport, and beyond that, a cemetery.Because they were I.N.S. detainees, they were not allowed to go outside without an escort. Agency officers continue to guard the doors to the motel.Mr. Wishnie said that for a long time, the Government did not raise the possibility that his clients would be allowed to stay, refusing to discuss the options until all of the men and women convicted had pleaded guilty. It was only in February, he said, that prosecutors began exploring the possibility of offering them legal status, he said.The visas they could soon receive, known as S-visas, are offered to cooperating witnesses who can provide information for the prosecution of cases in the United States, or those who, having provided the information, fear for their lives once they return home. The immigration agency grants no more than 250 a year for the entire country. To apply for one, a petitioner has to have a law enforcement agency as a sponsor.In this case, the Mexicans have three sponsors: The Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. The final decision is made by the Attorney General and the I.N.S.While it could take months to process the petitions, Mr. Bergeron said the workers would not remain in custody for more than 30 more days. Once they have the S-visas, they can apply for legal residency in three years, and five years after that, for citizenship, the goal of many immigrants."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/05/movies/film-review-torn-between-music-and-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Torn Between Music and the Deaf", "date": "1998-06-05T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from June 5, 1998, Section E, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The recovery movement is filled with stories of children who grew up having to take care of emotionally dysfunctional parents. But what about those children who had to run interference for emotionally healthy parents with physical disabilities? In Caroline Link's film ''Beyond Silence,'' the story of a gifted young musician and first-born child in a family where both parents were deaf becomes a powerful metaphor for the inevitable communication gap between children and parents in even the happiest of homes. Imagine the frustration of being a gifted musician whose parents are literally unable to hear.The early scenes of this German film (which was nominated last year for an Academy Award for best foreign picture), show Lara (Tatjana Trieb), the 8-year-old daughter of Martin (Howie Seago) and Kai (Emmanuelle Laborit), to be resourceful beyond any ordinary expectations. Wide-eyed and ingratiating, Lara is adept at two languages: German and sign language. Her parents not only dote on her, they depend on her to help them negotiate many everyday transactions, including telephone calls, banking and even parent-teacher conferences. Precociously sophisticated in the ways of the world, Lara is already a skillful diplomat. When translating into words the sign-language tantrums of her hot-tempered father, she tactfully softens their tone.Because of their dependence on her, Lara has an unusually strong bond with her parents. And in the movie's early scenes, the relationship among the three is portrayed as idyllic in its special intimacy and mutual gratitude. That happiness begins to erode when Martin's sister Clarissa (Sibylle Canonica), a professional clarinetist, gives her niece a clarinet for Christmas, and it quickly becomes apparent that the little girl is unusually talented.As Lara immerses herself in music (she is eventually drawn to klezmer music), her regular schoolwork suffers. At the same time, her absorption in a world that is inaccessible to her parents opens old family wounds. Flashbacks recall Martin's childhood jealousy over the attention paid to Clarissa for her musical talents and his bitter sense of exclusion from the bosom of the family after he laughs at the sight of his sister playing.''Beyond Silence'' makes a sudden awkward transition when the story jumps forward a decade, and a different actress (Sylvie Testud) assumes the role of Lara. Ms. Testud's edgy, introverted Lara is so opposite the adorable Shirley Temple-like child of the first part that it's difficult to connect the two, and the movie almost appears to be starting over from scratch. Encouraged by Clarissa, Lara leaves her parents in the care of her younger sister to enroll in a Berlin conservatory.At this point, ''Beyond Silence'' loses much of its focus as it wanders from topic to topic. Because of her upbringing, the movie suggests, Lara is emotionally stranded between two worlds: those of the hearing and the nonhearing. Her father, in particular, is desperate for her to remain his principal caretaker. Should Lara's first allegiance be to her talent or to her parents? Lara, following Clarissa's example, strikes out on her own.The movie turns unconvincingly warm and fuzzy when Mr. Right appears in the person of Tom (Hansa Czypionka), a teacher for the deaf who, like Lara, has normal hearing but can speak in sign language. When she attends one of his classes in which he introduces his deaf students to music by having them put their ears to the floor to feel the vibrations of dance beats, the movie seems to be sending a falsely reassuring message that music is really accessible to everyone. The movie glides to a sentimental ending as various estranged characters reconnect in pat, teary-eyed encounters.If the movie eventually turns to mush, its hardheaded performances tug against the sentimentality. As Martin, Mr. Seago, one of the most active deaf actors in America, conveys both the resilience and the frustration of a vigorous man trying to break through his wall of silence.The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations.BEYOND SILENCEDirected by Caroline Link; written (in German and German Sign, with English subtitles) by Ms. Link and Beth Serlin; director of photography, Gernot Roll; edited by Patricia Rommel; music by Niki Reiser; production designer, Susann Bieling; produced by Thomas Wobke, Jacob Claussen and Luggi Waldleitner; released by Miramax Films and Buena Vista International.

The lawyers contend that the system has not done enough to insure that the inmates can communicate with lawyers or their jailers.Amanda K. Wilson, the head lawyer with the Public Interest Law Firm in San Jose, said she filed the suit in San Jose last week after four years of negotiations with officials of the county jail system and efforts to help hearing-impaired inmates. For example, Ms. Wilson wanted law-enforcement officers to be required to provide the hearing impaired with a written version of their right to consult a lawyer.Ms. Wilson said the Santa Clara County jails had violated state and Federal civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination against the disabled.She said deaf and hearing-impaired inmates had rarely been provided with sign-language interpreters or devices that could be plugged into a telephone to display typed phone conversation on a screen. Without these aids, she said, deaf inmates cannot communicate well with prison employees, lawyers or doctors.Tim P. Ryan, chief of the Santa Clara County Department of Correction, said that only a few hearing-impaired inmates were held among the county's jail population of 4,800 at any one time. Mr. Ryan said his department had made a serious effort to provide them with the necessary communication aids.''We're not a perfect system,'' he said, ''but I believe we are meeting the obligations under the Americans With Disabilities Act for anybody in our system with any disabilities.''But Ms. Wilson said that although all inmates had access to telephones in their cell blocks for use at any time, it usually took three days to a week for deaf inmates to get the equipment they needed to use the telephone because the equipment was broken or because of delays. So those inmates could not let relatives or employers know immediately that they had been arrested, she said.''Deaf and hard-of-hearing people are isolated to begin with,'' she said, ''but this is unnecessarily isolating them.''The civil suit, filed in Federal District Court on April 7, seeks an immediate correction of the situation and an unspecified amount in damages for four plaintiffs who say their constitutional rights were violated by the jail because they could not effectively communicate. The suit was filed by three inmates and the wife of one of them. Specifically, they contend that the jail system has failed to comply with the 1992 Americans With Disabilities Act, which protects disabled people from discrimination, along with a 1973 Federal anti-discrimination law and two California statutes.Mr. Ryan, the correction chief, responded: ''We bring into custody about 200 people a day, and there's a screening process that each of them goes through to find out what their needs are. Whether they're hearing impaired or sight impaired, we address all their needs to make sure that they live comfortably, safely and securely within our environment.'' Staff members who can communicate with deaf inmates are available on most shifts, he said, and the inmates are provided with telecommunications devices and an 800-number service.But the three plaintiffs who were jailed said in the lawsuit that no qualified sign language interpreters were available when they were arrested in the last several years."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/22/nyregion/out-of-servitude-deaf-mexicans-languish-in-limbo-of-motel.html", "headline": "Out of Servitude, Deaf Mexicans Languish in Limbo of Motel", "date": "1998-03-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from March 22, 1998, Section 1, Page 35Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Eight months after they walked into a police station seeking relief from bosses who kept them as virtual slaves, 48 deaf Mexican men and women are still being held by Federal authorities in a motel in Queens while the case they set in motion winds through the courts.The Mexicans and their 11 children, including three born since they were detained, are being held as important witnesses for the prosecution, said Leslie Cornfeld, an assistant United States Attorney in Brooklyn. Because they entered the country illegally, the Immigration and Naturalization Service is in charge of them. The Federal Government and the City of New York have spent close to $3 million on caring for the immigrants.As detainees, they cannot step outside the motel without an escort or receive visitors who have not been approved. But because they are also victims with special needs, they are treated to a variety of perks rarely offered to undocumented immigrants detained elsewhere: they send their children to public schools, eat Mexican food and go outside to play sports several times a week.The detainees declined to talk to a reporter for fear that their comments might jeopardize the prosecution's case against the men and women who are accused of smuggling them into the United States and exploiting them here.They also fear that talking to reporters, which prosecutors discourage, might hurt their chances to remain in this country once the case ends, said a regular visitor who counsels them. Immigration officials are not expected to rule on whether they can stay here until the detainees are no longer needed as witnesses. But prosecutors and city officials are arguing on their behalf.The plight of the Mexican immigrants became national news on July 19, after four of them went to a police station and handed a note to an officer asking for help.The details of their horrific life shocked the city as government officials, neighbors and commuters realized that the deaf young men and women who sold $1 trinkets in the subways were really indentured laborers, kept in cramped apartments and often tortured or starved by their bosses. Soon after, 20 men and women were indicted on charges that ranged from slavery to alien smuggling; 18 have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.While lawyers and prosecutors wait for the sentencing hearings, the Mexican immigrants -- 26 women, 22 men and 11 children -- wait at the Westway Motor Inn, a nondescript motel opposite a cemetery in Astoria, Queens, and close to La Guardia Airport.Interviews with lawyers, prosecutors and others who see the detainees regularly provided some details of what life is like in the motel. They are well cared for, their lawyers said. They receive medical assistance and frequent visits from volunteers and church members. But, just as detainees everywhere, they cannot go to the movies or walk outside by themselves or visit friends.It is a boring life, one restricted by guards who monitor them and by the uncertainty about what is going to happen next. ''They are like a big family,'' said Florrie Burke, the executive director of the Lexington Center for Mental Health Services, who spends many hours at the motel counseling the immigrants. ''Sometimes they get along; sometimes they don't. Who wants to live in close quarters? It's been a long time and there are moments of boredom and uncertainty, but it is not a bad life.''Ms. Burke said they keep busy. No one spends the day in bed, but they do watch a lot of Spanish-language television. They also draw and paint and decorate their rooms with handicrafts that awe those who see them.''Through their art, they have taught us about their culture and values,'' Ms. Burke said. ''When they see our admiration, they tell us, 'Isn't this what you do in America too?' And we have to tell them that well, mostly, we go to the stores and buy it and that's it.''Six times a week, in alternating groups, they are escorted to the Lexington School for the Deaf/Center for the Deaf, five minutes away in Jackson Heights. They are driven to appointments with doctors and to the hospital when needed, as was the case with the births of three children -- 5 months, 3 months and 2 weeks old. A 16-year-old, who is deaf, goes to the Lexington school, while a 7-year-old, who can hear, attends a public elementary school in Queens, Ms. Burke said. Immigration officials would not say whether the children are escorted to school.Younger children and their parents attend parenting and toddler classes. Adults are taught to write English and to perfect their communication skills in American Sign Language. Those who need to, can talk to mental health counselors. Those who want to, can communicate with their families in Mexico through letters or telephone conversations using an interpreter and aided by the Mexican consulate. They celebrate birthdays and baptisms as well as Mexican and American holidays, and they are often visited by a priest who offers Mass. Although they have no garden or courtyard in the motel, they are taken to local parks where they play soccer.''Life goes on inside the motel,'' said Mike Wishnie, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the detainees. ''But they are eager to begin a normal, productive life.''In an agreement between prosecutors, the Mayor's office and immigration officials, the Mexicans were taken to the motel, in part, because they have special needs and because there was no other place to put them. They do not have a home or relatives in New York. The Federal Government agreed to pay for most of their motel costs, interpreters and medical needs, while the city offered to pick up some of their lodging bills, as well as the cost of food and personal items.Although they have not been charged by the immigration service for coming to the United States without visas, the Westway motel has, in effect, become a Federal detention center, run by immigration officials and protected by 14 guards who watch the detainees day and night in two 12-hour shifts. Michael W. Gilhooly, the director of public affairs for the Eastern region of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said none of the detainees have tried to escape.Federal officials estimate that they have spent $2.5 million on lodging and interpreters. New York City says it does not have a total of how much it has spent, but a spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management said it costs $13.55 a day to feed each person at the motel, which means the city has spent about $200,000 on food so far.Ms. Cornfeld, the lead prosecutor on the case, said the Mexicans would remain in the motel until the case had concluded. Eighteen defendants, including the ringleaders, have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges, including keeping the Mexicans in involuntary servitude, money laundering and alien smuggling. Two others are being held by Mexican authorities, but the United States Government is seeking their extradition, Ms. Cornfeld said. Sentencing hearings for the defendants in the United States are expected in April or May.After that, the fate of the immigrants is in the hands of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but Ms. Cornfeld said that the United States Attorney's Office in Brooklyn has begun looking into the possibility of getting special visas for the immigrants that would allow them to become residents of the United States. Such visas, known as S-visas, are offered to cooperating witnesses who can provide information for the prosecution of cases in the United States, or those who, having provided the information, fear for their lives once they return home.The Mexican immigrants qualify on both counts, their lawyer said. Mr. Wishnie said his clients are terrified of what could happen to them or to their families in Mexico once their bosses are sentenced. They have told him that the deaf community in Mexico is a small and close-knit one; the relatives of those they have helped to convict know where their families live.''These are uniquely vulnerable individuals, because of their deafness and lack of status,'' Mr. Wishnie said. ''And yet, they came forward to turn in their exploiters, they have cooperated to see that the bosses go to jail despite their fears of retaliation. And now, if given the chance, many of them would like to stay.''The city, too, would like them to stay. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has written to the Justice Department asking that the Mexicans be granted visas. Jerome M. Hauer, the director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, said the city is prepared to offer them job training, jobs, housing, and medical benefits.''We've tried to make them comfortable as much as possible,'' Mr. Hauer said. ''We will put all city resources in place to assist them.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/15/nyregion/views-sign-language-it-s-the-talk-of-the-town.html", "headline": "Sign Language: It's the Talk of the Town", "date": "1998-03-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "DEAF people aren't the ones Pat Massey worries about; she is convinced they can take care of themselves.Instead, Ms. Massey, worries about people who can hear and about everything they miss out on because they don't know the language of the deaf community, experiences like getting to know her daughter Nichele, who was born deaf 15 years ago.To bridge the gap, Ms. Massey decided to teach other hearing people how to use sign language.

It will be ''the mother of all mudslides,'' added NBC's crack newsman Geraldo Rivera. The only question: Can we finish devouring all 700 fun pages before tomorrow night, when ''60 Minutes'' offers Kathleen Willey in the flesh, presumably to expand upon her vivid account, already reported by Newsweek, of all the President's manhood?It's in this cultural context that we must salute two politicians who go against the grain: Senators Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana. In a touching -- some dare call it brave -- gesture of bipartisan moral leadership, they have banded together to protect the deaf from ''The Jerry Springer Show.''Discovering that a Department of Education grant pays for the closed-captioning of TV, from C-Span to ''Baywatch,'' the Senators on March 3 wrote an indignant letter to the Education Secretary, Richard Riley, demanding that he cut off public money that helps caption Mr. Springer's ''degrading and prurient program,'' which provides a ''window . . . on the depths to which our culture has sunk.''If only these upstanding politicians monitored public-affairs broadcasting as assiduously as they do Mr. Springer, the nation's hearing-impaired might be protected from Geraldo and ''60 Minutes,'' too. But two guys taking on a profane world can only do so much at a time.However the Monica Lewinsky story may end, assuming it does end, this much is clear: There's no going back to the relatively genteel culture we believed in only months ago. This was further dramatized this week by the completion of another pet project of Senator Lieberman's -- the V-chip. On Thursday the Federal Communications Commission gave the final O.K. to the gizmo and the alphabet-soup TV ratings that will supposedly enable parents to keep their kids from watching Springer and company.''Today brings good news for millions of parents who feel adrift in the rising tide of sex, violence and vulgarity that is flowing into their homes through the television and too often washing over their children'' is how Mr. Lieberman celebrated the moment in a press release. But who joined him in his proud victory? The panacea that so recently launched a thousand front-page stories, Op-Ed debates and bitter arguments among politicians, child-advocacy groups and TV executives is now so beside the point that its long-awaited official enactment merited barely a back-page yawn from the national press.This is because the news itself has now become the raciest entertainment in the land -- and news broadcasts are not covered by the V-chip or ratings. One network executive I spoke to this week said there was little evidence to suggest that the public really cared about the whole crusade anyway. ''We know when we've hit a nerve -- if we delay a soap opera for a news interrupt, we get literally thousands of calls,'' said the executive, who asked to remain anonymous. ''But over a year we've had a total of 17 calls, letters and E-mails about TV ratings.'' Given how cavalierly the networks fudge their ratings -- not a single daytime soap earns an ''S'' (for sex) in a recent TV Guide -- the public's silence is all the more deafening.Did Bill Clinton create this anything-goes culture? Hardly; even the impressive First Libido can't eroticize the entire nation. This week's Variety estimates that Americans rented or bought some 600 million individual adult videos last year -- more than two for every man, woman and child. What the Lewinsky story has done is uncloset an enormous grass-roots tolerance (and consumption) of private prurience that buoys the President and baffles his foes. When even Billy Graham speaks of Mr. Clinton in soft-porn prose -- rationalizing his alleged sins as those of a ''strong, vigorous, young man'' with ''a tremendous personality'' that causes ''the ladies [to] just go wild over him'' -- you know this country's sexual median is not in Kansas anymore.Under these circumstances, the small-bore efforts at moral renewal by politicians like Senators Lieberman and Coats are our last best hope. If they're not yet ready to stamp out sex on ''60 Minutes,'' let's pray they get to the bottom of the taxpayer-funded Library of Congress program that distributes Playboy in Braille."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/03/nyregion/the-neediest-cases-their-joy-louder-than-silence-deaf-children-frolic-at-center.html", "headline": "The Neediest Cases; Their Joy Louder Than Silence, Deaf Children Frolic at Center", "date": "1998-01-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from January 3, 1998, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The room was packed with romping children, but an uncanny silence filled the air. The only sound was that of tearing paper and a few errant squeals as the 50 or so youngsters, all of them deaf or hard of hearing, unwrapped their holiday gifts at the Rhinelander Children's Center on the Upper East Side.Bianca Thomas, 6, wearing a gold hoop in one ear and a hearing aid in the other, beamed as she held out her new Porky Pie doll for the world to see. Her mother, Sophia Thomas, stood in a corner and watched with folded arms as Bianca gestured merrily to other children, most of whom, like her, had yet to learn sign language.''Just seeing her interact with kids makes me happy,'' said Ms. Thomas, a nurse's aide who lives in Jamaica, Queens. ''This is a big deal.''For a deaf child, a simple frolic with other children can be frustrating, even terrifying. Playmates who can hear are often insensitive to the handicaps of others, and games can end in taunts, ridicule and tears. Like many parents of deaf children, Ms. Thomas keeps a protective eye on her daughter, limiting the kinds of people with whom she comes in contact. ''You know how cruel kids can be,'' she said, explaining why Bianca spends most of her free time with adults, who understand how to behave around a deaf child.But every other Saturday, Bianca spends the entire day with those just like herself. Because most deaf children attend public school with hearing classmates, the center's free program for deaf and hard-of-hearing youngsters is the only opportunity many have to socialize without fear. ''The best thing about this place is that no one here is going to make fun of her,'' Ms. Thomas said.And because most of the children come from low-income families -- with parents too poor or too busy working to take sign-language classes -- many of the children feel a harsher alienation than those whose parents can afford special programs.''So many of these kids spend their week isolated from the rest of the world,'' said Denise Taylor, the director of the Rhinelander Center, which is run by the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. ''When they leave here, they are better communicators and they have a stronger sense of themselves.''During the Saturday programs, the younger children visit museums and roller rinks or learn computer skills; the teen-agers go rock climbing or volunteer in soup kitchens and nursing homes for the deaf and blind. The center, on East 88th Street, also runs sign-language classes and support groups for parents.In the two years she has been going to the center, Joella Bailey, 9, has changed from fearful introvert to social butterfly. Born with a genetic disorder that left her deaf and learning-impaired, she is only now starting to read lips and sign. During the rest of the week, Joella attends school with hearing children, but she rarely gets play dates with them.''It can get real lonely for a deaf kid,'' said her mother, Jennifer Bailey, a math teacher who lives with Joella in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.The program also exposes the children to deaf teen-agers, most of whom behave and dress like their hearing peers. ''When they see these older kids, they think, 'Gee, I'm going to be like that one day,' '' Ms. Bailey said. ''It's important for them to have role models who are like them.''Unlike many of the others, Rennae Ramdeo, 14, lost her ability to hear only recently. What started as an annoying buzz in her ears ended in near-total deafness a few months later. Once a gregarious, athletic child, Rennae quickly withdrew when classmates began heckling her. ''She was an excellent gymnast, but the coach asked her to leave the team, saying she might have balance problems,'' said her father, Khemchan. ''That really broke her.''The last few years have been devastating for the family, which recently immigrated from Trinidad. ''As traumatized as we are, we don't want her to see our sadness,'' Rennae's mother, Zeriffa, said.But last Saturday, the Ramdeos were all smiles as Rennae plunged into the crowd, fearlessly signing with other adolescents. In the end, she had to be dragged away by her parents, who had to return to their home in Ridgewood, Queens. ''It is such a relief to see her happy again,'' Mr. Ramdeo said.HOW TO HELPChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to P.O.

And in her classes at the University of Connecticut students aren't allowed to speak either.But that doesn't prevent the 43-year-old adjunct professor from communicating with her students. This is where they learn American Sign Language, which she is here to share with the hearing culture.''That's the one rule we have in class: you can talk to me, or to each other, but only if you use American Sign Language,'' Ms. Simons-Marques signed through an interpreter. ''After all, I don't want to be left out of the conversation.'' Deaf since birth -- and the daughter of deaf parents -- Ms. Simons-Marques attended the American School for the Deaf in Hartford. At the University of Connecticut, students who enroll for the class say that at first they worry how they'll communicate with their new teacher -- but that their fears are soon allayed.Relying on an immersion method of teaching that combines physical gestures, facial expressions, demonstrations and a little blackboard work, Ms. Simons-Marques is not only a masterful communicator but also a natural-born storyteller.''When I started the class last spring I was really worried,'' said a 20-year-old junior, Lisa Casella, who is planning to become a teacher. ''But I realized right away that she was so smart, funny, and was an incredible communicator. She'll do just about anything to get her point across.''Chris Thorkelson, public information officer for the American School for the Deaf -- the oldest such school in the United States and the birthplace of American Sign Language -- agreed that Ms. Simons-Marques possesses an unusual ability to communicate.''She is such a vividly visual person that she is able to bring this beautiful language to life and teach it as well as anyone I have ever met,'' said Mr. Thorkelson, who learned the language a few years ago as a student of Ms. Simons-Marques. ''She's challenging and very demanding . . . and that sometimes surprises people who mistakenly think that because she's deaf she's some kind of pushover.''During a recent beginners' class, Ms. Simons-Marques pounded on a desk to get the attention of her new students, used her hands and arms to help describe both words and ideas, and after a few moments had the students completely mesmerized by her animated style.As the weeks go by, Ms. Simons-Marques relies more and more on the foreign language she is teaching; American Sign Language is offered at the school through the department of modern and classical languages in the critical languages program.A.S.L. was a rarely taught course just a few years ago at American universities, but an increasing number of colleges are offering it now for credit as a foreign language course, one that allows the hearing to communicate with the estimated 2 million deaf and 21 million hearing-impaired people in the country.With its own vocabulary, idioms, grammar and syntax, American Sign Language differs from other forms of non-verbal communication like finger spelling and manual English, which are more like codes.''It's far more appropriate to offer it as a foreign language because A.S.L. has all the properties of a natural human language, and can be used by everyone, not just the deaf or hearing impaired,'' Ms. Simons Marques signed. ''It is very encouraging to me that A.S.L. is becoming so much more popular now.''More visibility in recent years of prominent deaf people -- like the actress Marlee Matlin -- has helped the spreading popularity of American Sign Language by the hearing culture, according to linguistics and deaf culture experts.''Students find A.S.L. a fun language because it uses the hands and eyes to accomplish what other languages do using the mouth and ears,'' said Diane Lillo-Martin, who heads the linguistics department at the University of Connecticut and sometimes serves as an interpreter for Ms. Simons-Marques. ''It's a very useful language because students who learn it can then communicate with a segment of the population that is right here in this country: the deaf and hearing-impaired.''Ms. Lillo-Martin says she has found in her years of conducting research and studies on A.S.L. that it is crucial for deaf children to learn the language as early in life as possible. But she is also delighted to have the hearing take it up, at whatever age.''The more people who learn A.S.L. the better,'' she said.Robert Hoffmeister, director of programs in deaf studies at Boston University said that the growing interest in American Sign Language has a lot to do with deaf people becoming more assertive about their need to communicate with the hearing culture.''Deaf people are far more empowered today than ever before and for the most part no longer view themselves as disabled,'' said Mr. Hoffmeister, who can hear, but was raised by deaf parents. ''Having Doreen and other deaf people teaching A.S.L. sends a very powerful message about what deaf people are capable of doing. And A.S.L., which is a very exotic and wonderful language, is certainly becoming much more commonly known.''But Ms. Simons-Marques, one of the few deaf A.S.L. university instructors, says it's not an easy language for hearing culture students to learn.''It's difficult at first for many students because hearing people depend so much on listening, and to learn sign language students are required to use their minds to visualize because this is a language of pictures,'' Ms. Simons Marques said. ''It takes a lot of time and practice.''Her students agree.''I thought I was taking an easy elective to fill some credits, but I found out pretty fast how involved a language it really is, and now I absolutely love it,'' said Kendall Shanklin, a 19-year-old biology major from New Haven. ''I really enjoy the language and have also learned a great deal about deaf culture. To tell you the truth, she's such a good communicator that when I'm in class, I don't even think anymore about the fact that she's deaf.''Neither does Cathy Karas.But when Ms. Karas attended her first class earlier this year she didn't understand why Ms. Simons-Marques wasn't saying anything to her, and in fact, didn't even seem to understand what her new student was saying.''Here I was, standing there talking and talking away, asking her all kinds of questions, and it was kind of frustrating that she didn't seem to understand what I was saying,'' said Ms. Karas. ''But that experience also helped me to realize what it must be like for deaf people all the time . . . and how important it is for us all to be able to communicate with each other.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/14/us/discovery-of-gene-offers-clues-on-deafness.html", "headline": "Discovery of Gene Offers Clues on Deafness", "date": "1997-11-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from November 14, 1997, Section A, Page 28Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.A large extended family in the town of Cartago, Costa Rica, has long had an unusual affliction to set against its blessings.The affliction is a strange and incurable form of genetically caused deafness.

By 30 they are deaf in both ears.In a finding that may help understand the nature of other kinds of hearing loss, too, scientists have now traced the cause of the family's affliction to a previously unknown gene. The gene helps operate the delicate hair cells in the ear that respond to sound vibrations.In the Costa Rican family, the gene has a single change or mutation that was present in the family's founder, who arrived in Cartago from Spain in 1713. He suffered from this form of deafness, as have half of his descendants in the eight generations since. All the children are taught to lip read at an early age. Many stay in Cartago because the family's hereditary deafness is well known and accepted.''Everyone in town stands close to them and speaks clearly,'' said Dr. Mary-Claire King, a geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle.Dr. King's laboratory helped isolate the gene in collaboration with Dr. Pedro E. Leon of the University of Costa Rica in San Jose. Dr. Leon, a tropical biologist by training, has studied the family for 20 years and researched its genealogy. Their findings are being published today in the journal Science.Dr. Eric D. Lynch, a member of Dr. King's laboratory, led the effort to identify the genetic change or mutation that caused the deafness. With only a single family to work with, and thus fewer genetic differences to go on, pinpointing the gene took six years. The gene mutation involved just one of the 3,800 chemical letters that constitute the gene's DNA.Having worked out the sequence, or order, of chemical letters in the gene, Dr. Lynch and his colleagues searched computerized databases and found that a gene of nearly identical sequence, named diaphanous, had been detected in fruit flies.The human version of the diaphanous gene proved to be active in many different tissues of the body. But the Costa Rican family is healthy and normal in every respect except hearing. Only in the hair cells of the ear does their slightly different form of the diaphanous gene cause any problem.The hair cells are an extraordinarily delicate mechanism. Some cells are tuned to particular frequencies of sound, and others convert the sound into nerve signals. Because of the difficulty of this task, and the heavy mechanical and electrical stresses involved, it may be that the hair cells are less tolerant of genetic blemishes than most other tissues of the body.''The ear seems to be peculiarly vulnerable, as evidenced by the fact that there are 100 familial diseases of hearing and that so many people become deaf,'' said Dr. A. James Hudspeth, a hearing expert at Rockefeller University.Dr. Hudspeth said that identifying the genes involved in the activity of the hair cells, as the Seattle team did, would help to explain the cell's biology and to pinpoint the things that go wrong in various kinds of hearing loss. Some 30 million Americans suffer significant hearing loss, most of which is caused by damage to the hair cells.The genetic approach to hearing, analyzing the ear by isolating the genes that operate it, is a relatively new and growing field, said Dr. Bronya J. Keats, a geneticist at the Louisiana State University Medical Center in New Orleans. The human diaphanous gene will ''add to our knowledge of how the ear works,'' Dr. Keats said.The Seattle team quickly came up with a likely role for the diaphanous gene in hair cells. From its role in the fruit fly, the gene's product is known to control the assembly of actin molecules, a major structural material of living cells. Actin is particularly important in the hair cells, where it provides the structural rigidity for several parts of the apparatus that converts sound into electrical impulses.The mutation in the Costa Rican family's version of the diaphanous gene forces an error in the way the gene is processed by the cell. As a result the last 52 in the 1,265 units of its protein product are incorrectly formed. In most cells of the body the protein oversees the assembly of actin well enough. But evidently the hair cells are more stringent in their requirements, and the protein's misshapen tail must somehow interfere with its duties.The researchers hope to find other genes that play important roles in the hair cells' activity, since a thorough understanding of the relevant genes should help them figure out the causes of various kinds of deafness."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/24/nyregion/deaf-peddlers-were-tortured-with-stun-guns-enforcer-says.html", "headline": "Deaf Peddlers Were Tortured With Stun Guns, Enforcer Says", "date": "1997-10-24T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from October 24, 1997, Section B, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.A brother and sister, said by officials to be two leaders of a ring that forced deaf Mexican immigrants to peddle trinkets in the subways and streets, used an electric stun gun to torture some who did not sell enough or who had tried to escape, an admitted ring enforcer said yesterday.The account came from Agustino Rodriguez Torres, 26, himself a deaf Mexican immigrant, as he pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to criminal conspiracy involving his role as an enforcer. Prosecutors charge that the ring smuggled the illegal immigrants into this country and held scores of them in servitude in two packed houses in Queens and a third in Chicago.Investigators said that Mr. Rodriguez Torres's plea deal, which includes cooperation, was important because he was a prime enforcer and could incriminate two of the reputed leaders of the Queens houses, who are among 20 people indicted since the operation was discovered in July.The two leaders are Adriana Paoletti Lemus, 29, and her brother, Renato Paoletti Lemus, 24, members of a family of deaf Mexicans that officials say organized and ran the ring. The workers were forced to give the leaders all their earnings from working long hours peddling key chains for $1 apiece, prosecutors said.''I was directed to hold the worker in a bear hug while Adriana or Renato tortured the worker by firing a stun gun at him,'' Mr. Rodriguez Torres said, describing how workers were sometimes punished if they were deemed laggard or had been caught trying to flee. ''On some occasions, Adriana and Renato made me fire the stun gun.'' At other times, workers were beaten, he said.His account was read in court by his lawyer, Roger J. Bernstein.

Since 1988, Mrs. Glendenning has worked for Trump Casino Services, the administrative organization that operates three casinos here. Mrs. Glendenning, a native of Atlantic City, and her husband, Gordon, an upholsterer, are both deaf.In an interview conducted in writing, Mrs. Glendenning, who uses American Sign Language, mentioned that she felt a special affinity for the Gallaudet company. All performers in the company, based at Gallaudet University in Washington, are deaf. Their dancing, which incorporates sign language, has a special expressive power for those who, like the Glendennings, must communicate visually.The Glendennings' daughter, Kim, can hear. They want to take Kim, 24, to the performance because they consider the Gallaudet dancers worth seeing regardless of their deafness. ''They are very, very good,'' Mrs. Glendenning said, and good dancing, regardless of one's ability to hear music, ''is so beautiful to watch.''This is the paradox of having a disability in the working world, Mrs. Glendenning said. On one hand, disabilities have nothing to do with an individual's desire to perform in competitive situations. ''I chose to work in the casino industry,'' she said, ''because it was very interesting to me, it pays well and has good benefits.'' For nearly a decade, she has worked in clerical and word processing positions for all three Trump casinos, and she says her work has been as good as, if not better than, that of hearing employees in similar positions.On the other hand, disabilities create situations that inspire special relationships and moments. Mrs. Glendenning teaches sign language to other employees and has served as a guide for charter groups of deaf gamblers. She regularly accompanies casino employment recruiters to job fairs throughout the state.The casino industry has been ''very good at hiring people, all kinds of people,'' she said. ''It is true: I am deaf. But I am not disabled.''Although businesses employing disabled individuals can qualify for tax savings under the Americans With Disabilities Act, there has yet to be an accurate accounting of disabled workers at Atlantic City's casinos. Sandy Rodriquez, who oversees equal opportunity employment policies for 16,325 Trump casino employees, said she had no way of knowing exactly how many Trump employees could be considered disabled.''The Casino Control Commission tried to chart it across the industry and wasn't successful because there was a problem at deciding who was or wasn't disabled,'' she said. ''I'd take a guess at around 40 percent in the working for Trump Hotels might qualify as disabled, and that would include people with diabetes, people undergoing special medical treatment, others whose disabilities might not be so obvious.''Ms. Rodriquez said she had to guess because ''even though we ask people to indicate if they're disabled, they are not required to make that indication, and most of them don't.''Gene Terkelsen, director of the Atlantic County Office for Disability, said the casinos had emerged in the past five years as the largest employer of the disabled in South Jersey ''because the casinos need the folks.''''Twenty years ago, there were fewer casinos and everybody wanted to work for them, and there weren't that many jobs to go around,'' he said. ''Now, the industry has expanded to the point that there are thousands of diversified jobs, and with the high turnover the casinos have, they're having a tough time filling those jobs.''At the Gallaudet performance tonight, representatives of local organizations will present an award to a disabled resident of Atlantic County and cite the employer most cooperative in hiring disabled individuals.Of course, not everyone who is hired by a casino keeps the job, Ms. Terkelsen said. ''There's a lot of pressure and responsibility to casino work,'' she said. ''It's definitely not for everybody. But at least there is an opportunity for people who might not think they are employable to get in touch with employers who are willing to make allowances for them. A lot of these people have careers now. They have titles and responsibilities. They don't think of themselves as disabled.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/17/nyregion/metro-news-briefs-new-york-two-plead-guilty-in-case-involving-deaf-mexicans.html", "headline": "Two Plead Guilty in Case Involving Deaf Mexicans", "date": "1997-10-17T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from October 17, 1997, Section B, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Two of 20 people charged with holding deaf Mexicans in servitude in Queens and Chicago and forcing them to peddle trinkets in the subways and streets pleaded guilty yesterday to criminal conspiracy in deals through which other charges against them were to be dismissed.In the statements accompanying their guilty pleas, the two, Raul Alanis, 25, who is also deaf, and Alfredo Rustrian Paoletti, 37, indicated that they played brief and relatively minor roles in the scheme.

They were forced into the underground economy because current law prohibits their employment of any illegal immigrant, disabled or not.But for deaf immigrants who are eligible for green cards or citizenship, the United States is the land of opportunity. The Lexington Center and School for the Deaf, a 135-year-old academic and social service agency at 30th Avenue and 75th Street in Jackson Heights, not far from the apartments where the trinket peddlers lived, is one of many institutions that provide unusual training to the disabled.Lexington, like many other American schools for the deaf, has shifted over time from the so-called oralism that dominated schooling for the deaf for decades. The old system emphasized time-consuming and often unsuccessful efforts at speech, and the newer system stresses mastery of sign language. In Mexico, by contrast, only the biggest cities even have schools for the deaf, and their focus is on the old-fashioned oral methods.Lexington also has access to the latest aids: telephones that allow the deaf to send messages by teletype, devices that flash when a doorbell rings or a baby cries, dogs trained to alert their masters to sounds the human ear cannot hear. In underdeveloped countries, such help is generally unavailable or unaffordable.These educational and technological services are staples at schools like Lexington, which is private but financed with public money. But tides of immigration have brought curricular changes.The school has developed a tri lingual approach to teach deaf children in their home language (be it Urdu, Russian, Spanish or Cantonese), the school language (English) and American sign Language, a visual communication system with its own syntax, vocabulary and grammar. Lexington's student body is now nearly 60 percent foreign-born, from families that speak 28 different languages.Some immigrant children arrive able to speak their native language but with varying degrees of impairment. Some can read a bit. Some are familiar with the sign language used in their home country, which is different from American sign language in vocabulary but similar in grammar and syntax.Others arrive illiterate in all three languages, with no communication skills other than an idiosyncratic form of sign that deaf people commonly develop when not taught a formal version.Developing language skills under such circumstances is a complicated process with, say, a deaf teacher fluent in Spanish and sign aided by a Russian or Chinese translator. While the first instructor presents the lesson, the children with other languages read the lips of native translators. Hands are flying, multiple languages are spoken, multiple sets of lips are read, until the children master English and American sign language.Lexington's vocational center has also developed programs to deal with the crush of new immigrants, who are often ignorant of their legal status under America's changing immigration laws.To guide clients through the process, the center assigns sign language interpreters to accompany the deaf to immigration hearings, explain the law and translate documents. But despite all these advantages and innovations, an illegal immigrant educated or trained at Lexington and other places like it eventually runs into a brick wall when the time comes to find a job: Federal immigration laws.Graduates of vocational programs who lack legal status cannot be offered job placement services.''They cannot access the system,'' said Dr. Kevin Keane, who is Lexington's assistant superintendent. ''So we are training them to do what? Eventually, they will have to enter the underground economy.''

The Mexican federal police were called to the bank and arrested the two men, who then led the authorities to a home in the low-income neighborhood of Narvarte, where Renato and Jose Paoletti were being held in a locked room, the Mexican officials and a United States investigator said.''The door was bolted from the outside,'' said an investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''So it looks as if these men were going to take the money and leave them there.''Even before the Paolettis' arrest had been processed, United States and Mexican officials began the delicate tug-of-war over which country would place them on trial first. In Mexico, where news of the peddling operation has horrified the public, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo has pledged to prosecute both men on unspecified charges, even though they are accused of committing more serious and violent crimes in the United States. Leslie Kornfeld, a deputy chief in the United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn, said last night that United States officials were still determining whether to pursue extradition.Law enforcement officials had tracked the younger Paoletti from New York to Los Angeles and among a network of his friends and relatives in Mexico, and they were heartened last week when Renato Paoletti was sighted at a basketball game for deaf athletes.A Federal complaint filed in District Court in Brooklyn charges that Renato Paoletti was known as ''The Boss'' in the various flophouses where the peddlers lived, and that he routinely ordered beatings, confiscated the workers' proceeds and sexually assaulted some of the women.''Renato Paoletti was a ringleader of the conspiracy to smuggle aliens into this country for profit,'' Ms. Kornfeld said. His father, Jose Paoletti, is accused of recruiting deaf Mexicans and helping to smuggle them into the United States, according to papers filed in Federal court.Although the deaf peddlers, who sold key chains and other trinkets, had become a common sight on New York subways in recent years, the authorities first learned of their brutal living conditions on July 19, when four peddlers walked into the 115th Precinct station house in Queens and handed a note to the desk officer. City police and Federal immigration agents raided two of the residences in Queens and discovered abysmal conditions, with people crammed into six-foot cubicles, and as many as 50 living in one home.The workers said they had been lured from Mexico with promises of riches in the United States. But once they were smuggled by bus through Tijuana, Mexico, the peddlers said, they were forced to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week, and were beaten if they failed to sell at least $100 worth of trinkets per day.Federal agents tracked down leads provided by the 54 victims, many of whom are still being housed in a New York hotel, and found evidence that the Paolettis also controlled operations involving deaf Mexican immigrants in Chicago and Los Angeles.

After the visas expire, the Mexicans will be able to apply for status as legal residents of the United States, said Brian J. Jordan, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington.The Federal authorities are preparing criminal cases against 17 men and women in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago who have been arrested on charges ranging from smuggling illegal immigrants to keeping them enslaved.Mr. Jordan said it had not yet been determined how many of the 55 Mexicans, most of whom are illegal immigrants, would be allowed to stay. But, he added, some have already been selected, based on the testimony they have offered.As the investigation continues, others may be added to the list of those who stay, he said. Exactly what information they can provide is being determined as the investigation continues, Mr. Jordan said.''It all depends on how legitimate the information they have is,'' he said.On July 21, United States Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, asked Attorney General Janet Reno to grant S visas to the Mexicans. Through a spokesman yesterday, Mr. Schumer said he was ''gratified'' by the decision of the Justice Department to allow at least some of the Mexicans to stay.''The I.N.S. and the Justice Department have done the right thing and the humane thing by granting these visas,'' he said. ''I'm gratified that these men and women will not be victimized twice.''Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had also asked the immigration service to let the Mexicans remain in New York. From the beginning, Mr. Giuliani has insisted that the Mexicans were not only victims but also witnesses to a crime. Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani could not be reached for comment.The fate of those who are not selected as witnesses has yet to be determined. Mr. Jordan said his agency would not deport any of the Mexicans while there is legislation pending in Congress concerning their status in the country. On July 22, United States Representative Nydia Velazquez introduced a bill that would allow Congress to grant legal residence to the Mexicans.''This is a very sensitive issue,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''We want to see how we can work together with the city, Congress and everybody involved in this issue. While Congress is talking about having them stay, the decision remains up in the air.''The immigration service's current caution contrasts markedly with the position immigration officials took when the Mexicans were found two weeks ago in houses in Jackson Heights and Corona by the New York City Police Department. Several of the Mexicans had delivered a note to the police asking for help. Then, Federal immigration officials had been ready to bus them to a county jail in Pennsylvania, and there was talk about immediate deportation. But Mr. Giuliani insisted that they remain in New York.Eventually, Federal officials and the city agreed that the Mexicans would stay in New York City while the investigation continued, but under the custody of the immigration service, which has kept them at the Westway Motor Inn in Astoria, Queens. The city and the immigration service also agreed to share the expenses of the Mexicans while they were in New York.An immigration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said yesterday that, as the investigation widened to other states and more arrests took place practically every day, the deaf Mexicans from Queens became central to the investigation and their chances of staying in the country as witnesses improved. Mr. Jordan said that once officials determined how many of the Mexicans would remain as witnesses, they would be moved from the motel. But he said he did not know where the immigrants would be housed."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/02/nyregion/17th-arrest-made-in-case-of-deaf-mexican-peddlers.html", "headline": "17th Arrest Made in Case Of Deaf Mexican Peddlers", "date": "1997-08-02T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from August 2, 1997, Section 1, Page 23Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Federal authorities charged yet another person yesterday with being part of the cross-country ring that they say exploited and abused deaf immigrants smuggled from Mexico.Like almost everyone arrested so far, the man charged yesterday is a deaf illegal immigrant, whose job, the authorities said, was to administer beatings to other deaf people at the behest of a group ringleader.The arrest, the 17th so far in the case, came at the end of a busy week for Federal investigators in New York, Chicago and especially Los Angeles, where on Thursday they broke up an operation that they say smuggled perhaps hundreds of deaf people into the country.The authorities have yet to say publicly exactly how widespread -- or lucrative -- they think the organization was. But the picture they have painted of its leadership was altered slightly in court papers filed yesterday.Renato Paoletti Lemus, a man in his early 20's who has so far evaded arrest, has until now been described as ''the boss.'' But the papers filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn assigned a broader role to Mr. Paoletti Lemus's 29-year-old sister, Adriana, portraying her as a driving force who ''helped'' workers into the United States and who ran the family's first house of deaf peddlers in New York.The papers said Ms. Paoletti Lemus ordered the man charged yesterday, Augustino Rodriguez Torres, 26, to beat workers ''when they have attempted to escape and when they don't return with sufficient money after a day of selling trinkets.'' The authorities say that the Paolettis forced the deaf peddlers to sell $100 worth of cheap trinkets each day.A law enforcement official said yesterday that the authorities believed Mr. Rodriguez Torres was the more vicious of two ''enforcers'' who lived at one of two houses in Jackson Heights, Queens, that were jammed with dozens of deaf peddlers and their bosses.Like the other person called an enforcer, who was arrested earlier this week, Mr. Rodriguez Torres was among the 57 people taken into protective custody on July 19 and housed in the Westway Motor Inn in Queens. Only later did officials to hear from other peddlers that he was not a victim but one of their abusers.Mr. Rodriguez Torres was charged with smuggling illegal immigrants into the United States, transporting them and concealing them from the authorities.The two main agencies investigating the case, the United States Attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, have been tight-lipped about their progress. But officials say they are still looking at possible connections in cities beyond Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.The officials also say they now believe the operation in Chicago, where four people have been arrested since last weekend, was simply one cell of the same organization and that the leader there, Norma Alcantara, was probably working under the Paolettis. Originally, officials speculated that Ms. Alcantara, who was arrested last weekend, had set up shop in Chicago first and taught the Paolettis how to run a similar organization of deaf peddlers.An official close to the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said money-laundering charges might be filed. The authorities have not said how much money the organization brought in, but the official said it was ''substantial.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/01/nyregion/3-charged-with-smuggling-deaf-mexicans.html", "headline": "3 Charged With Smuggling Deaf Mexicans", "date": "1997-08-01T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from August 1, 1997, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Federal authorities charged three men today with running an operation based in Southern California through which possibly hundreds of deaf Mexicans were smuggled across the border, kept briefly in a house here, then taken to New York City where they were held in virtual slavery and forced to peddle trinkets.The United States Attorney in Brooklyn, Zachary W. Carter, announced the arrests of Andreas Pfeiffer and Hilario Pauletti, whom he identified as leaders of the Los Angeles smuggling ring, and Mr. Pauletti's son, Carlos Rivera, a midlevel manager.The authorities described them as associates of the extended Paoletti family, a Mexico City-based clan whose members have been charged with holding 62 deaf illegal aliens in two safe houses in Queens.At the same time, officials announced the arrest in Chicago of Pedro Santamaria on related charges of smuggling aliens. He is said to have supervised the trinket-selling activities of a group of illegal Mexican immigrants there before transporting them to New York to work in the Queens operation, which investigators now believe was closely linked to the Chicago group.The arrests bring to 16 the number of people charged in the case, and Mr. Carter said that additional charges were expected.''There are other cities that are being aggressively pursued,'' said one law-enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said evidence suggested it was possible that hundreds of illegal immigrants had been smuggled through the Los Angeles connection.The suspects, who were arrested late Wednesday, were arraigned in Federal court here this afternoon on charges of transporting, harboring and concealing illegal immigrants. They were ordered held without bail at the request of an assistant United States attorney, Thomas D. Warren. They entered no pleas. A hearing was set for Aug. 8 about transferring them to Brooklyn to face charges.At the arraignment today, Mr. Pfeiffer and Mr. Rivera refused to acknowledge their identity and were listed as John Does, Mr. Warren said. Court documents listed the name of one suspect as Hilario Paoletti, although the name was spelled Pauletti on his identification card, Mr. Warren said.Details on the arrests were sketchy, and prosecutors and immigration officials here and in New York declined to answer many questions about the latest suspects. But some details of the goings-on in a modest frame house on the edge of this city's bustling Koreatown emerged in court papers released by prosecutors in Brooklyn.The court documents identified Hilario Paoletti, known as Lalo, as a cousin of the man authorities describe as the ''boss'' of the multicity organization, Renato Paoletti-Lemus, who is still at large. Renato is the son of the family patriarch, Jose Paoletti Moreda, a onetime commercial artist for the Mexican Communications Ministry who is himself deaf and who, the authorities say, built an empire that brought workers into the United States illegally.The family came to Los Angeles in the mid- to late 1980's, relatives and associates said, and began using other deaf Mexican immigrants to help them sell trinkets around the city. But the Paolettis apparently grew fearful that advocates for the deaf would look askance at their work, and after Mr. Paoletti's daughter, Adriana Paoletti Lemus, moved to New York and found the market there more lucrative, the family moved its operations and expanded them in relative anonymity.But Los Angeles remained the processing center for immigrants smuggled across the border outside San Diego. The authorities said that since at least 1995, Mr. Pfeiffer, a deaf, German-born man who married a Mexican woman and was known as Andy P. and the Butterfly, ran the house and assisted Lalo Paoletti by transporting immigrants to the home from Mexico, concealed in a van. Once here, they were put to work selling trinkets at Los Angeles International Airport and other locations. They returned to the house to sleep each night.In the court papers, Lalo Paoletti was said to be the one who ''orders the workers around,'' according to an informer familiar with the group's operations in New York and California. Carlos Paoletti, who is also deaf, once went to the Mexican border near San Diego to meet other members of the family from Mexico bringing illegal immigrants into this country, and then drove them to Los Angeles, the court papers say.According to the court papers, Mr. Santamaria, an illegal immigrant, worked with the Chicago operation's leader, Norma Alcantara, who was arrested last week and charged with harboring illegal immigrants.Investigators say that Mr. Santamaria accompanied Ms. Alcantara on trips from Chicago to New York to transport vendors to work in the New York ring, and also went to Mexico to bring back workers. One informer told the authorities that he was seen striking workers ''when they did not bring in enough money.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/27/nyregion/for-deaf-peddlers-both-opportunity-and-exploitation.html", "headline": "For Deaf Peddlers, Both Opportunity And Exploitation", "date": "1997-07-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 27, 1997, Section 1, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.You can buy practically anything at the wholesale stores on Los Angeles Street: smiling ceramic Buddhas, crates of heart-shaped sunglasses, countless Spanish-language videos of action movies. The deaf peddlers come mostly for key chains.And among these deaf peddlers who come to the markets to stock up on merchandise, the Paoletti family of Mexico City distinguished itself long before it made headlines in New York. At one storefront bazaar here, the family now accused of having all but enslaved scores of deaf immigrants as street peddlers is known for having ordered its key chains by the thousands of dozens.Yet if the Paolettis were remarkable figures in this silent underworld, it was mostly for the scale of their operations and the extremes to which they are said to have gone in mistreating the men and women they lured from Mexico to Queens.Since the 1970's, researchers and social service workers say, poor immigrants have largely taken over and transformed a byzantine economy of deaf peddlers, which has its roots in places like Los Angeles Street and extends from shopping centers in Chicago to retirement villages in Florida and Texas.$(On Saturday, Federal investigators arrested two people described as the leaders of a trinket-peddling operation in Chicago similar to the one uncovered in New York last weekend. Page 26.$)But many of the peddlers and several other people who have studied their world described it as much more complex and diverse than the latest news might suggest.For some of the young recruits, the work is simply a hard way to an honest living, a source of enough income to survive in the United States while pursuing opportunities for schooling or job-training that do not exist in countries like Cambodia or El Salvador. They may work alone or in groups, they say, but their associations are voluntary and their bosses generally fair.For other deaf peddlers, though, there is nothing new in the stories of exploitation and abuse told by the young Mexicans who worked for the Paolettis. Separated from their families and smuggled into the United States, these immigrants have found themselves at the mercy of their own avaricious masters, ''kings'' who run their peddlers much as a pimp might run a stable of prostitutes.''You know how this American dream is,'' said Esther Lozano, 50, a Mexican woman who was in Los Angeles visiting a family of deaf friends who sell trinkets at shopping malls. ''People come here with the hope that they will be able to do what they could not do before -- people who are deaf and people who are not. But all of those people come to suffer. The deaf just suffer more.''Some students of deaf culture said the story of the Paolettis recalled nothing so much as the tale of Leon Krakover, a deaf Chicago entrepreneur who built his street-peddling empire into a corporation complete with lawyers, accountants, a staff of deaf door-to-door salesmen and an apartment hotel to house them.Mr. Krakover's own flurry of headlines, which followed his expulsion in 1948 from the National Fraternal Society for the Deaf and a $2.5-million lawsuit that he filed in response, delineated a postwar struggle between a deaf underclass and what The Cavalier, a national deaf newspaper of the day, referred to as ''the self-respecting deaf.''Members of the latter group saw the peddlers as a mendicant stain on their collective image. But even as access to better schooling and better jobs has led more and more deaf Americans to mark their distance from the ranks of the disabled, the flood of new immigrants from Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe in the last three decades has replenished the pool of deaf people living in isolation and need.One man, who gave his name only as Eduardo and said he was a political refugee from Guatemala, was typical of the new work force.A thin 35-year-old who wears his hair in a short ponytail, Eduardo said he still had nightmares about his experience, and he agreed to speak to a reporter only on the condition that his last name not be printed.He told of leaving his home in the quiet colonial town of Antigua eight years ago, after both he and his father were threatened for their activities on behalf of opposition political parties.While living in exile in Mexico, Eduardo said, he met another deaf man in the northern industrial city of Monterrey who told him of lucrative work waiting just across the border in Texas.Eventually, the man provided Eduardo with false identity papers and led him, along with seven deaf Mexicans, past American immigration agents at the border crossing in Laredo. But almost as soon as the group arrived at a home that the smuggler owned in Natalia, Tex., near San Antonio, Eduardo and the Mexicans were put to work in a regimen very different from what they had imagined.''We got almost nothing to eat,'' Eduardo said, speaking through a sign-language interpreter at a special school he attends in Los Angeles. ''We had to sell every day, from six in the morning until seven at night. The boss had a very big house, but he did not give us anything.''On Christmas night in 1989, a few visitors arrived for a party at the Natalia home. Sensing a chance to escape, Eduardo said, he hid outside the house until one of the visitors emerged, and then begged the man to take him away. The visitor agreed, but only on the condition that Eduardo trade sex for a plane ticket to Los Angeles. ''They were very bad people,'' Eduardo, who complied, said, breaking down in tears.Although social service agencies in the United States have expanded their services to the deaf and to immigrants, deaf immigrants are still prone to fall through the cracks.Some of them arrive knowing only the sign languages of their native countries; some arrive without any sign language at all. Public conveniences that are taken for granted by American-born deaf people -- like telephone links that allow them to communicate by typing -- remain stubborn mysteries. Available jobs stay just out of reach.The isolation of a life in silence is compounded for those who live in fear of the immigration authorities. Those who have left their families behind have little choice but to depend on small groups of others like themselves. And often, the king peddlers who profit from such vulnerability are deaf themselves.''In order to recruit these people, to train them and to spread them around to work, you have to be able to sign,'' said Carol A. Padden, a professor at the University of California at San Diego who studies deaf culture and is deaf herself.''You have to have an organizer, and typically, that is a deaf person.''The business itself is more intricate than it might appear from the cards that are quietly placed beside customers. Printers offer the cards with a variety of sales pitches -- from ''I am deaf . .t.'' and ''I love you'' to ''Please pardon my intrusion, but I am a deaf person trying to earn for college expenses.''At wholesale emporiums like the ones on Los Angeles Street, the peddlers choose items that are cheap, light and utilitarian: nail-clippers ($4 a dozen) are a favorite, as are pencils and pens (prices vary) and key chains bearing the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint ($4.50 a dozen for the small, $5.50 for the large). Almost always, the items sell for $1 apiece.Most of the deaf peddlers who crowd the displays at L.A. Top Distributor, a favorite Los Angeles Street store, take their trinkets by the dozens. The salesmen there remember the Paoletti family as the deaf people who stopped shopping there several years ago, only to start calling again last year from New York with huge orders for spinning-globe key chains.The family's most recent invoice, on Feb. 28, was for 24,000 such key chains at 11.25 cents each. At $1 each, the sales would have made the Paolettis $21,300 -- before shipping charges, subway tokens and the modest sums they apparently spent to lodge and pay their peddlers. (The police believe the shipment would have lasted less than a week.)Sales territories also vary. Some bosses prefer airports, for the waiting travelers with disposable cash. Peddling rings have been known to fight occasionally over shopping malls they have staked out as turf. At the Los Angeles International Airport, the sales choreography can be baroque.Maria Correa, 33, a deaf native of Mexico City who now lives in Whittier, Calif., operates independently but sometimes works with friends. She arrived at Terminal One at noon on Friday. By 3:30, she had worked her way through half of the departure lounges and was preparing to leave. There was more money to be made, she was sure, but there were also more deaf peddlers lined up behind her.''I can't sell all day,'' she said. ''I know there are other deaf people here trying to sell. I want to show them respect.''Ms. Correa said she knew of about 30 small rings of deaf immigrant peddlers in the Los Angeles area. Typically, she said, the bosses put up the money for the trinkets and receive about half of the take. For most of the bosses, that kind of profit margin is apparently enough; bosses as abusive as the Paolettis are relatively rare, she said.But social service workers, researchers and some former peddlers suggested that at least some level of coercion often seemed a basic part of the arrangements.Sally Campbell, who trains many deaf immigrants as the coordinator of Special Services at the Abram Friedman Occupational Center in Los Angeles, said some of her students had been forced by bosses to drop out of classes in English and American Sign Language when the schooling was apparently seen to have got in the way of their work.A deaf immigrant from Mexico, Margarito Flores, 39, of Anaheim, Calif., said it was easier for other deaf immigrants to understand the hardships that went with the job.''This is helping me and my family,'' Mr. Flores said through a translator. ''I don't want to have to borrow money. I want to earn money. I look at this as a living.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/26/nyregion/in-mexico-deaf-find-the-future-lies-north.html", "headline": "In Mexico, Deaf Find The Future Lies North", "date": "1997-07-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 26, 1997, Section 1, Page 24Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.It is one of the first things they learn: the right hand, palm up, resting atop the left hand, palm down. In Mexican sign language this is the United States, and to deaf Mexicans the United States is a glint of hope in a dark and silent world.Even a glimpse of life here gives some idea why. For most deaf Mexicans, there are no teletype telephone services, like those common in the United States. No doorbells have lights attached, no smoke alarms emit flashes and no television programs have closed captions.If they can find work, the deaf do the most menial of jobs, cleaning floors or sanding wood. The legal minimum wage is about $3 a day, but the deaf often find their employers paying them less than other workers. For many, begging on the subway or selling cards printed with the sign language alphabet is the way to survive here.In the eyes of Mexican law, the deaf are considered incompetent. They cannot hold a driver's license, nor can they buy a house unless a hearing person co-signs the contract. There are only six government schools for the deaf in Mexico, all ending at the sixth grade, and six private schools, only one going through middle school. And because there is no standard sign language, words are signed differently in Mexico's north and south.Jorge Badillo Huerta, director of the National School for the Deaf in Mexico City, said that conditions in Mexico are so grim that 80 percent of deaf adults go to the United States.Some, in desperation, chase empty promises. Law enforcement officials in New York say 57 deaf Mexican immigrants, apparently lured by the hope of better pay, were held in virtual slavery in two cramped apartments in Queens and forced to work peddling trinkets on the subway.''If President Ernesto Zedillo wants to understand how all this happened in New York, all he has to do is take a look in his own backyard,'' said Luis Fernandez Pintos, a deaf 17-year-old in Mexico City who played basketball with deaf friends on Wednesday, the same night that President Zedillo, in Chicago, condemned what had happened to the Mexican immigrants in New York.In a country of many poor and marginalized people, the deaf are almost invisible. The national statistics institute figures that about 630,000 Mexicans out of 96 million people have serious hearing problems. The Mexican Institute for Hearing and Speech Pathology estimates that 9,000 Mexicans are profoundly deaf. But most advocates say the actual number of deaf people is much higher.Imelda Santiago Garcia, 19, and her brother, Ismael Santiago Garcia, 22, both deaf since birth, know well the poverty and exploitation that is common here -- as well as the deep isolation sometimes broken only by a small, almost cultlike circle of the deaf themselves.Miss Santiago Garcia, with her long brown hair and easy smile, rarely ventures from the tiny house embedded in an enormous slum called Nezahualcoyotl on the outskirts of Mexico City, where she lives with her parents and another brother and sister, who all can hear.Mr. Santiago Garcia, however, was always in the street, looking for adventure with his close group of deaf friends, who constantly showed him the palm up, palm down sign that, they said, meant money and a better life.When Ismael walked out of the house 14 months ago, saying he was going to the United States, Imelda wanted to go too. But after seeing television images of the 57 immigrants, including her brother, who had been crowded into the Queens apartments, Imelda said through her sister that ''America is ugly'' and that she wants her brother to come back.While the deaf in rural Mexico tend to be benignly neglected, in a few cities people like Imelda can get some special training. Her mother, Juana Ofelia Garcia de Santiago, proudly takes a photograph from the turquoise wall of her home showing Imelda in one of her grammar school classes, where she learned the basics of how to sign and read lips. Another photo shows Ismael as a bright 12-year-old, fascinated with soccer and mechanical drawing.''We are a poor family, and for me, as the mother of two deaf children, it was not a struggle that lasted just a few months but of years to teach them what was right and what was wrong,'' Mrs. Garcia de Santiago said.One day, after suffering the taunts and sneers of her classmates, Imelda simply told her parents ''no more school.'' Now she hopes to be able to sell to others the kind of trim dresses she makes for her mother.As for Ismael, after finishing middle school he took a job in a bicycle factory, greasing axles. It did not last long. Then he went to work in a small woodworking shop, where he sanded the pieces of rustic tables and chairs.He worked hard, his mother said, and gave her about $7 a week to help run the house. He kept the rest of his salary in a box in his dresser. On Sundays, he played soccer with a group of deaf friends.In time, those friends had more influence over him than his family, said his sister Pilar, 20. They constantly berated Mexico, and held up the United States as a place where a deaf person could lead a wonderful life.His mother had taught him that even though he was deaf, his hands could do work. Still, Ismael sometimes sneaked to the subway to sell small cards that said ''I am deaf,'' for a peso, roughly a dime. One day his mother found one of the cards and reproached him. He said there was nothing wrong with what he had done.Nearly every deaf Mexican at one time or another is tempted to peddle or beg in the streets. ''In the beginning I felt ashamed,'' Sergio Torres Falconi said. Mr. Torres Falconi, 22, is an actor in a deaf theater company in Mexico City called Senas y Verbos, or Signs and Words. ''I didn't even know how to do it, but a friend told me how,'' he said. ''I was very nervous. But I couldn't find work, and I didn't want to ask anyone for a loan. Now it doesn't bother me.''Earlier that same day, Mr. Torres Falconi, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the New York skyline, and a cap imprinted with an image of the Statue of Liberty, had dodged the traffic at a busy intersection in Mexico City while he sold his cards. In two hours, he said, he had made 100 pesos, about $12.But while the indignity of begging can be overcome, the deaf say they cannot escape being robbed, physically abused and even exploited by gangsters who demand a percentage of their take.''All deaf people here are living what the deaf in the United States lived 50 years ago,'' said Consuelo Manero, a psychologist and sign interpreter in Mexico City who graduated from Gallaudet University for the deaf in Washington, D.C.''I try to imagine myself as a deaf person here in Mexico,'' Miss Manero said. ''If I go to school, no one understands me. I can't go to most social events, I have no technology to help me, and I'm totally dependent on others to make phone calls for me or buy bus tickets. I don't have anything here, except the dream to go to the United States.''One spring night in 1996, Mr. Santiago Garcia returned from work several hours late and announced to his surprised family that he was leaving. Where? they asked. ''The United States,'' he said. And how will you get there? ''Friends,'' he said. He did not identify them.The next morning, May 9, Ismael awoke early and showered. He took his money from the box in his dresser and packed a small bag with just two shirts and a pair of pants. His friends told him that with all the money he would make in the United States, he could buy new clothes.When he said goodbye, his mother cried. She lighted a candle before a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe on a shelf above the table where Ismael used to do his homework.Because they are in the United States illegally, Ismael and the others are likely to be deported. Many of them have told the police that they do not want to go back to Mexico. Ismael's mother fears that even with the horrors he has seen, he may prefer life in the United States over what he will have in Mexico.''It's been a year and two months since he left,'' she said. ''I don't know what he's going to be like when he comes back.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/26/nyregion/carolina-raid-finds-exploited-deaf-mexicans.html", "headline": "Carolina Raid Finds Exploited Deaf Mexicans", "date": "1997-07-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 26, 1997, Section 1, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Federal agents raided two houses in this small, blue-collar city today and found more than a dozen illegal Mexican immigrants, most of them deaf, who the agents believe were ''held in bondage'' by bosses who exploited their deafness for profit.Describing what people here had thought of as a distant, big-city problem, Federal agents said the immigrants were lured with a promise of a better life, then coerced by ''bosses'' into peddling trinkets at shopping centers and mills for just scraps of the profits.Officials with the Immigration and Naturalization Service said they had raided the houses after receiving information from the Mexican Government. The agents said they believed the deaf Mexicans had been smuggled into the United States, then held as virtual captives by threats from the two people who ran the houses.The United States Attorney in Greensboro, N.C., said prosecutors were exploring whether the operation in Sanford was linked to the people charged last week in New York City with holding dozens of deaf Mexican peddlers in virtual slavery. A law enforcement official in New York said investigators believed there was a connection, but the official would not elaborate on what the link was or whether any of the New York suspects had a hand in the North Carolina operation.Investigators in North Carolina were still conducting interviews tonight, and no one had been charged yet.Meanwhile, Federal prosecutors in New York arrested another man today in connection with the smuggling ring in Queens. The prosecutors charged the man, Frank Coenen, a deaf 35-year-old son of a retired New York City police detective, with conspiracy, saying that he had helped bring the illegal immigrants to New York and had aided the trinket selling. Mr. Coenen is the former husband of Adriana Paoletti Lemus, a 29-year-old Mexican woman whose family, prosecutors say, organized the New York operation.Investigators in New York said they were pursuing leads to determine whether similar operations, directly or loosely tied to the people arrested in Queens, were being run in other cities in addition to Sanford.In Chicago, I.N.S. officials were interviewing seven deaf Mexican peddlers today in a neighborhood in the north part of the city. Curtis Aljets, acting district director of the I.N.S. in Chicago, said that there was a ''connection'' between the people in Chicago and those New York, and that his office was providing information to prosecutors in New York.But he said that the peddlers in Chicago did not appear to be subject to the sort of coercion that prosecutors have described in the New York case.In North Carolina, agents raided the two brick houses shortly after sunrise in a working-class section of Sanford, about 40 miles southwest of Raleigh. In all, 17 people -- 9 men, 5 women, 2 children and an infant -- were taken to immigration offices in Charlotte, N.C, and then to a local hotel. Thomas Fischer, a senior I.N.S. agent who conducted the raids, identified Marcos Moises and his wife, Guadalupe, as the ''bosses'' who oversaw the peddlers.''They were not threatened with weapons, but were manipulated with threats and other coercion,'' said Mr. Fischer, who said investigators believed other houses in Sanford could be raided in the coming days. ''These people were exploited. They were held in bondage.''Patricia Arce Barcenas, a mother in Mexico City, said today that she believed her son, Mauricio Portillo Arce, was among those discovered in Sanford. She said that her 16-year-old deaf son had disappeared last March after leaving for his job at a ceramics factory, and that a month later she had been telephoned by a woman in North Carolina who told her the boy was ''fine'' and selling key rings. The caller identified herself as Teresa Norato Palencia and said that she was calling on behalf of her deaf mother, Guadalupe Moises, according to Ms. Arce.Last June, Ms. Arce said in an interview, she received a packet of correspondence -- two letters, one in her son's hand, another in a stranger's, $50 and a photograph of her son by a road sign saying, ''Welcome to Virginia.''Mexican officials said today that a 26-year-old woman, whom they identified as Gloria Hipolito Hernandez, had come into the Mexican consulate in Detroit on Tuesday and told officials of the situation in Sanford.In Mexico today, the woman's sister, Gabriela Hipolito Hernandez, said Gloria Hipolito Hernandez had left home last March with Guadalupe Moises. She said her sister, who was deaf and could barely write or communicate through sign language, had been lured by the idea of making money selling trinkets in the United States.Gloria Hipolito Hernandez's family said Ms. Moises had talked convincingly of how she would work, make money, split the proceeds and see another part of the world. ''It was irresistible,'' said Pedro Hernandez, her brother. But the family members said that they had not heard from her since then -- no letter, no telephone call, no money.They said they believe she might have been in Detroit visiting an aunt when she went to the consulate on Tuesday.Federal agents in North Carolina said that the workers appeared to have been ordered out to surrounding malls and other nearby cities, such as Greensboro and Raleigh, to sell the trinkets, many of them attached to small American flags. They received only $5 a day, the agents said.The deaf Mexicans did not appear to have been physically abused, the officials said, but they believed they had no choice but to work and turn over the proceeds.Sanford, the seat of Lee County, is a city of roughly 20,000 people. The county's Hispanic population has grown over the last decade, with as many as 7,000 Mexicans among the roughly 50,000 residents. Indeed, the two top employers in Sanford, Golden Poultry, a chicken processing plant, and Tyson Foods, which makes taco shells and chips, are dominated by Mexican workers. Many other immigrants, legal and not, pick tobacco and vegetables.The presence of Mexicans on Woodland Avenue, then, was not in itself surprising. Neighbors said the deaf Mexicans had lived in the two-bedroom and three-bedroom houses for about two years. They said that four vans were used to transport the workers throughout the day, and that United Parcel Service trucks made regular dropoffs of the boxes of trinkets.''People were coming and going seven days a week, all hours of the day and night,'' said Kevin Buie, a 22-year-old man who lived next door.Aleqandro Arroyo, who runs the Mexican restaurant La Cabana, said the deaf peddlers would occasionally eat there, but ''we never knew'' that the people were being used in the way that Federal agents described. If it is true, he said, it is heartbreaking. Like the other laborers in the city's Hispanic community, ''they travel here looking for nice lives,'' he said. ''Then they are forced to work for so little.''It seemed more like something he would see on his satellite dish -- it gets channels from all over the country and Mexico -- from a big city like New York.And some residents said they wished that the scheme described by the Federal agents had remained a big-city thing.People, held in bondage, exploited for their labor, is part of this region's distant past. ''It struck me very badly,'' said Angela Madison, a hairdresser in Sanford."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/25/nyregion/poor-and-deaf-from-mexico-betrayed-in-their-dreams.html", "headline": "Poor and Deaf From Mexico Betrayed in Their Dreams", "date": "1997-07-25T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 25, 1997, Section A, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.With unerring regularity, the deaf immigrants sent glossy postcards home to their relatives in Mexico, suggesting a whirlwind new life in New York City, highlighted by regular sightseeing excursions to Rockefeller Center, the Statue of Liberty, even Bowling Green.But the messages were creepy, written in an unfamiliar handwriting, expressing banal wishes of good health. And at the bottom, the immigrants, like preschool children, got to sign their own names.In Mexico, many feared that the reality of their relatives' lives up north was not nearly as enchanting as the cards. Some felt that their relatives had been all but kidnapped. Until last weekend, though, when four of the immigrants walked into a police station with a letter revealing their plight, no one back home had any idea that they were virtually indentured servants in Jackson Heights, Queens: waking before dawn, peddling trinkets all day, and returning late to crowded apartments to turn over all their earnings to their Mexican bosses, who might or might not slap, insult or molest them, depending on the mood of the day, according to the authorities.Nearly a week after they were taken into custody, the immigrants have yet to publicly tell of their ordeal. But in several dozen interviews in Mexico, California and New York with former vendors, the immigrants' families, with associates of the bosses and with law enforcement officials, the individual stories of their harshly constrained lives begin to emerge.Before they left Mexico, it seemed like anything would be preferable to a life, poor and deaf, on the margin of the margins of society. The Paoletti family of Mexico City, deaf themselves, knew that. Before four of them and three associates were arrested this week on charges of running an immigrant-smuggling ring, they were fishing in a loaded pond, and they did not need much of a lure.Not for Omar Fernandez, 29, heavyset with a pencil mustache, who was an orphan selling chewing gum in Mexico City traffic when the Paolettis met him. Not for Ismael Santiago Garcia, 22, who was so bored by peddling alphabet cards in the slums that, at the first invitation, he scooped up his savings from a dresser drawer, threw a pair of pants into a backpack and pronounced his world ''dead.''And not for Delia Garcia Roman, 22, who was a teen-ager when she left, though for her the offer was sweetened with specific lies: a job in a boutique or antique store, and a home with a loving couple.By the time they were fully immersed in their American lives, they did not have time to dwell on their disappointment. They worked 12 to 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, with 2 days off every other month. If they were not captives, they believed they were, dependent on the bosses who had confiscated their documents and intimidated them with threats and abuse. In the way many saw things, they needed to escape, or to be rescued.One man, Oscar Moreno, 27, got out because he was an epileptic, but he was sent to the Paolettis' cousin's house in Los Angeles, where he now works as a vendor. Another, a woman with AIDS, was shipped off to Chicago, according to the stories the victims told prosecutors. Delia Garcia Roman was whisked away by her brother, who flew to New York and took her back to Mexico.And 57 others, including 12 children, were freed by the New York City police, after 4 among them dared to present themselves at the 115th Precinct station house in Queens to complain last weekend. They are now in a curious limbo, sleeping in king-size beds in a motel in East Elmhurst, Queens, submitting to daily interrogation by the police and Federal investigators and waiting to learn their fate.Many Noticed Them But Few Reached OutInside the Paoletti peddler ring, there was a numbing sameness to the daily routine, which started before daybreak with shoves, and emphatic hand movements that said: ''Get up, get up, get moving.'' The men and women packed their identical backpacks with their daily supply of 100 to 200 key chains, and headed out into the dark. If they were lucky, and they often were, local shopkeepers gave them free bagels and coffee.The city was carved up by subway lines, and workers were assigned routes by the color coding on the city subway map.Mr. Fernandez worked the blue line, the Eighth Avenue subways, every day, including Sundays, which is what particularly irritated him. The long hours did not bother him, and the bad living conditions were a step up from the near homelessness he knew in Mexico. But, because he was faithful, in the truest sense of the word, his Sundays were sacred. He would plead with Renato Paoletti Lemus to let him go to Mass.But Mr. Paoletti, the presumed ringleader who is being hunted by the authorities, forbade it, ordering Mr. Fernandez back to the A, the C and the E to sell miniature baseball bats and screwdrivers.As the immigrants crisscrossed the city by train, they proceeded mechanically from car to car. They usually worked as if in a bubble, keeping their heads bowed, avoiding eye contact. Even so, over the last year, they became a ubiquitous presence in underground New York, a phenomenon accepted almost without comment by a city with a profound capacity to absorb and digest. Few realized they were troubled; rather, hardened by the parade of so many beggars with such lurid stories, some suspected that they were not even deaf. But a handful of people -- some Christian proselytizers, some deaf people -- reached out.''We started a deaf ministry just to help them,'' said Deody Lantoria, 44, a computer operator who belongs to the All Nations Bible Baptist Church. ''Sometimes I wanted to report them to the I.N.S. for their own good, but I didn't.''At the end of each day, Mr. Paoletti or his sister, Adriana, or his mother, Delia, or his cousin, Alfredo, or sometimes even his father, Jose, would demand the vendors' earnings, according to former vendors. Renato Paoletti was a strict accountant, while his older brother Jose Jr., known as Pipo, was the softie.The vendors came home in small groups, sat crosslegged on their beds, or mattresses, or sleeping bags, and counted their money. They put rubber bands around the $1 bills, dropped the change into plastic baggies, and handed them in.Sometimes, they would get an extra dollar from someone who took pity on them. That, they would pocket righteously. But it was risky; occasionally, they were physically searched. A Legal Aid lawyer, Mihea Kim, said that they were fed according to how hard they worked, but health officials found none who were malnourished.Renato Paoletti kept a locked room in the back of one of the two residences, where investigators said they found $35,000 in plastic containers, including $10,000 in $1 bills and 20 Mexican identification cards. He sometimes summoned the women vendors there; three young women have told investigators that they were routinely molested, ''touched in their private parts'' by Renato Paoletti.At night, the men drank, and the women often cried, and the babies howled, creating a disturbing tableau in a neighborhood of immigrants. Those who came home late were often locked out, and slept in a nearby park.Ricardo Gonzalez, 25, was perpetually locked out for what the bosses called his laziness. He was also beaten. Sometimes he hid from Renato Paoletti in the apartment overseen by the kinder Jose Jr., underneath the bunk beds. But Renato would find him there, slam him against a wall, punch him in the chest, according to a close friend of Mr. Gonzalez. So he started sleeping on the subways. That is when he turned to Mr. Lantoria for help.Mr. Lantoria put him up in his own home in Queens, and took him to Manhattan with him every day, leaving him in Madison Square Park, and arranging to meet him at his lunch hour and then at the end of the work day. One day, however, Renato Paoletti tracked him down, and dragged him back to Jackson Heights.There are others who were let go, put on planes even. Minerva Gutierrez, 25, was sent back to her hometown, Yautepec, near Cuernavaca, with $2 in her pocket and a 2-year-old daughter, Paulina. Paulina's father is Renato, Ms. Gutierrez said. He sent them back because he did not want his daughter to suffer the cold of a New York winter, Ms. Gutierrez said. He also had a new girlfriend, Santa Gonzalez, who was one of the seven arrested last Sunday.Bound to Their Captors Through Complex TiesProsecutors trace the beginning of what they see as the Paoletti smuggling ring to Los Angeles in the late 1980's. But the Los Angeles operation did not get off to a good start. From the beginning, the first group of vendors were telling new recruits that the job barely paid. In 1990, a group of four young peddlers fled back across the Mexican border into Tijuana.''Here in L.A., it was easier for them to just leave,'' said Pablo Rea Escobar, 43, who has known the Paolettis since that time. ''In New York, they could not do that.''Starting in 1990, the Paolettis appear to have begun recruiting poor, young Mexicans from several states in Mexico to go to New York.Adriana Paoletti found Minerva Gutierrez in bustling Yautepec, through a teacher at the Institute of Basic Education, which locals unkindly refer to as ''the little Mongoloids' school.''On March 11, 1990, Adriana Paoletti came by her small stone house, picked her up and they disappeared into the state of Morelos.''I waited all afternoon, all night,'' said her mother, Mercedes Diaz Ocampo. She filed a missing person's report. A year later, she received a photograph of her daughter from New York.''She was pregnant,'' her mother said. ''I was angry.''When Ms. Gutierrez arrived in New York, the Paolettis' operation was still small, she said. She lived with Renato, his mother and two other vendors. At day's end, she handed over her earnings in a paper bag to Delia Paoletti, whom she came to consider her mother-in-law. She remains fond of her, even though she says Delia Paoletti beat her whenever she got pregnant by Renato, which was often.''I lost two babies,'' she said, holding out one hand, palm facing down, and making a swift slicing movement across her neck with the other. She does not know the whereabouts of her son by Renato, Jorge, who is 4.In 1993, when Delia Garcia Roman turned 18, Jose and Delia Paoletti, patriarch and matriarch of a growing business, visited her mother's home in Mexico City. They spoke of antique shops and boutiques, of love and respect and great earning potential. The words ''trinket'' or ''key chain'' were never uttered.Jose Paoletti Jr. drove her north to Tijuana, in a van with six other would-be immigrants, all deaf. In Ms. Garcia Roman's recollection, they simply drove across the border undetected.During the journey, Jose Jr. put his hand on her leg and began to rub her, she said. She protested, changed seats and he never bothered her again, she said.The van stopped first in Los Angeles, then in Las Vegas. In both places, the teen-agers were sent out into the streets to sell trinkets. Ms. Garcia Roman said her heart sank; she saw in a moment that she had been deceived. Stopping next in Denver, then Chicago, they finally arrived in Queens.Over the years, while many vendors felt bound to the Paolettis by a complicated psychological contract that prosecutors are working to understand, there were defections.When Omar Fernandez began to complain bitterly about not being paid, for instance, Renato Paoletti gave him a ticket to Los Angeles -- the sum total of his remuneration for several months' work -- where he now works, for modest pay, for a Paoletti cousin.There were also those who reveled in their New York City life, even in their work, according to Ms. Gutierrez and to Mario Guillen Martinez.Sitting in a small cinderblock house in Mexico City, across from a junkyard littered with the shells of cars, Mr. Guillen Martinez, 27, described his six years selling trinkets in the New York City subways as the happiest of his life. He was so happy that he recruited deaf friends into the organization, he said, and ended up charged with kidnapping by the Mexican authorities.During his time in the United States, Mr. Guillen Martinez said he led peddler road trips to Miami, Las Vegas and Texas. He returned to Mexico when he split with his wife, a fellow vendor, he said, and it has been a return to the kind of fingerpointing he first ran from.''They look at him, they make fun of him,'' said his father, Jose Guillen Vazquez. ''I tell them, this is not 'The Mute One.' His name is Mario.''Even if it meant facing such humiliation, Delia Garcia Roman wanted to return to Mexico. Her brother, Sergio, flew to Queens, where, he said, Adriana Paoletti greeted him cordially. Several vendors, though, slipped him surreptitious notes, asking him to contact their families to come get them, too, he said.He slept on a top bunk, only to be awakened at 5 A.M. by the others. Already dressed, they sat on their beds attaching ''I am deaf'' cards to piles of key chains.When they headed to the subways, he walked out the door with his sister.Recently, the Paoletti family patriarch visited Ms. Garcia Roman in Mexico City, scolding her for fleeing without properly thanking them. His audacity galled her.''They are a handsome family, and they can be charming,'' she said yesterday. ''But they caused heartache and suffering for many deaf people.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/20/nyregion/man-relates-tangled-tale-implicating-deaf-ex-wife.html", "headline": "Man Relates Tangled Tale Implicating Deaf Ex-Wife", "date": "1997-07-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 20, 1997, Section 1, Page 25Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.So far, few explanations have been offered for what led to the situation of 62 Mexican immigrants found in two Queens homes today. But a vehicle linked to the trinket trade many of the immigrants were forced to engage in led to a deaf Long Island man who says he can explain it all.The man, Frank Coenen, 35, was traced through a license plate on the white Plymouth van outside one of the apartments where the Mexicans said they had been forced to stay, selling pens and key chains for a man known as ''the boss.'' Neighbors repeatedly identified the van as one used to ferry the Mexicans and their wares.Mr. Coenen, who lives in the Long Island town of East Meadow, was interviewed this evening with the help of his speaking brother, Brendan.Mr. Coenen said that the mind behind the trade was his ex-wife, a 28-year-old woman from Mexico City named Adriana Paoletti. It was unclear whether she was connected to a man being questioned by the authorities today, known variously as Alfredo Paoletti and Alfredo Rustrian.Mr. Coenen said he and his wife divorced about a year ago, after three years of marriage, because she had been using his status as a citizen to bring dozens of relatives, friends and strangers to their apartment in Queens, then put them to work selling trinkets on the streets and in the subways.The business was begun using one of his credit cards, he said, and escalated into a scheme to make thousands of dollars off the backs of handicapped Mexicans hoping for a life in America.But he said he had no part in it. ''I have never been in trouble with the law,'' his brother interpreted as he signed. ''I don't even smoke or drink. This is her game.''Mr. Coenen said he made his living as a postal worker on Long Island, and that his sister is a police officer.He said that his wife began smuggling illegal aliens through San Diego with a brother of hers he knew as Renalto about three years ago, returning to a poor section of Mexico City twice a year to recruit more deaf people and to deposit thousands of dollars in accounts there.Using his credit card, he said, Ms. Paoletti would buy pens and key chains for three dollars a dozen from a company called Rhode Island Novelty, then send the immigrants out with cards asking commuters to buy the items for the good of the deaf.''Even children worked, as young as 11 years old,'' Brendan Coenen said. 'The kids were living tough, dragging up and down the subway twelve hours a day. They didn't have much to eat and were working for a place to live, something to eat, and a little pocket change for video games.''When Frank Coenen was asked why he did nothing to stop the exploitation, he said that it was his ex-wife's life, and her relatives.Mr. Coenen said he met his former wife in Los Angeles and fell in love, he said.But Mr. Coenen added that things quickly soured after they moved to Queens and 20 or so relatives began to move into their apartment.''I began to realize that she was using me,'' he said, adding that the couple left the apartment and moved back to Long Island briefly before his wife decided to move back to Queens, where she was closer to those now plying their small trade out of the apartment."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/20/nyregion/dozens-of-deaf-immigrants-discovered-in-forced-labor.html", "headline": "Dozens of Deaf Immigrants Discovered in Forced Labor", "date": "1997-07-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 20, 1997, Section 1, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Four deaf and mute Mexicans walked into a police station in Jackson Heights, Queens, before dawn yesterday, informed the police that they were indentured laborers and led them to two apartments crammed with deaf immigrants -- 62 men, women and young children who slept side by side on bunk beds, mattresses and sleeping bags.Using written notes and sign language, the immigrants told the police that they had been forced by a man who had smuggled them into the United States to work 18-hour days as trinket vendors, selling $1 key chains on subways and at airports. Some of the women made allegations of sexual assault, the police said; one had a black eye.''This is a very disgusting and horrible situation that is going to emerge over the next few days,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday in Queens. ''One man or more was holding a number of people in bondage or virtual slavery.''By yesterday afternoon, no arrests had been made, although the police were questioning the man whom the others referred to as ''the boss.'' He is 37 years old, and named either Alfredo Paoletti or Alfredo Rustrian. Last night, a Long Island man told a tangled story of marrying a deaf Mexican woman named Paoletti, who he said drew other deaf Mexicans to Queens and involved them in the trinket sales.But it was ''the boss'' who allegedly arranged the immigrants' passage, in small groups, through Newark International Airport, then confiscated their personal documents, shoehorned them into small apartments and forced them to peddle trinkets using cards that said, ''I am deaf,'' the authorities said. Every night, they gave their earnings to him and were instructed to stay out until they had $100 to bring back.From early yesterday, the police investigation was hampered by communication problems as officers scrambled to find interpreters of both Spanish and sign language. In fact, several of the immigrants had tried unsuccessfully to ask for help in previous visits to the station house, according to one detective. When four of them, three men and a woman, returned at 4 A.M. yesterday, it was with a letter written in Spanish.Written by the woman, the letter began, ''I am a woman who works at Newark Airport,'' and ended, ''I hope you have time to read this.''At dawn, the police roused from sleep two frightened groups of Mexican immigrants who apparently thought it was an immigration raid. Officers found 44 people in a four-bedroom, one-bath apartment at 37-54 93d Street, and 18 more in a two-bedroom at 104-15 34th Avenue. ''They thought we were the I.N.S.,'' said Officer Billy Milan, who described the way the immigrants began to frantically pack up clothes. ''They were going to leave.''One woman was able to read Officer Milan's lips as he spoke in Spanish, and helped to calm the two groups. At 6 A.M., they boarded a bus for the 115th Precinct for questioning. The police seized a basket of their trinkets, key chains attached to miniature baseballs, fake $100 bills or tiny screwdrivers.Outside the precinct, there was much commotion yesterday as the Mayor, the Mexican Consul, immigration agents and Red Cross volunteers descended on Northern Boulevard. One officer described the scene inside the station house as oddly chaotic and tranquil at the same time, because 60 people were talking at once, but in sign language.Officer Phil Rogan said the 10 children, who ranged from 4 months to 7 years old, were in good condition and ''quite charming.'' Unlike their parents, about half of the children were able to talk, in Spanish. The officers fed them bagels, milk and juice before the Red Cross arrived with provisions from McDonald's.In their busy immigrant neighborhood, straddling Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, these Mexicans stood out only because they were a large group of deaf people, who shopped in the Corona Deli Grocery using notes to request food they could not find. They also wore identical backpacks.''I had noticed them because I saw an explosion of deaf-mute Mexicans working the No. 7 line,'' said Mitchell A. Chiddick, who lives in the neighborhood. ''They were panhandling, selling pens and key chains, what have you.''Those who lived on their blocks, though, saw a sadder picture up close. Sometimes the women would sit on the front steps and sob loudly. The men would drink to excess and sometimes sleep in the nearby park. A neighbor, Jose Perez, said he had the impression that they were supposed to return by 11 P.M., or they would be locked out.''They looked so tired, so wasted,'' Mr. Perez said. ''I thought a school was organizing them and sending them out to sell these little things, but it was a mafia.''In two houses about 10 blocks apart, their living conditions, while extreme, were not uncommon, as many nearby houses are overcrowded, or divided into cubicles.The front bedroom at 93d Street held two sets of bunk beds, with five sleeping bags on the floor. Rumpled clothing, stuffed bears and rubber balls were strewn about the carpeted floor beneath a crucifix. In the back of the apartment, investigators said, there were 30 beds.The immigrants always paid their $1,600 monthly rent punctually, on the 22d of each month, most of it in $1 bills, according to their landlady, Esther Sotamba, who inherited them as tenants when she bought the house three months ago. For all other transactions, she dealt with the man she knew only as Alfredo.While the dominant Hispanic immigrant group in the neighborhood is Colombian, many Mexicans have been moving into Jackson Heights. Like this group, they come from different parts of the country: Mexico City, Oaxaca, Puebla and Guerrero.Cristina Cabrera, 23, who lives above one of the raided apartments, said that the immigrants told her that they were friends from a school for the deaf in Mexico. In Mexico City, the director of the National School of the Deaf said yesterday that he had had a student named Claudia Paoletti a few years ago, whose older brother was Alfredo.Although there have been several cases involving Chinese immigrants who were smuggled into this country and held in servitude, this is the first New York case involving Mexicans. Typically, the trip from Mexico is far less expensive than that from China, about $1,000 compared with $30,000. And typically, Mexican immigrants pay that fee upfront.There have, however, been a few cases involving Mexican agricultural workers held in remote locations, including a group of strawberry pickers in forced labor in California.''This was a very unusual situation, in that they were physically free, not in chains, and they were in contact with their relatives in Mexico,'' said Jorge Pinto, the Consul General of Mexico in New York City. ''But somehow this man had control over them. There is mention of sexual abuse and all sorts of horrors. It is especially horrible because they were handicapped.''Mr. Pinto said consular officials volunteered to contact the immigrants' families, but the Mexicans declined.Early yesterday afternoon, Richard A. Brown, the Queens District Attorney, said that the immigrants would be taken into custody by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.But when Mayor Giuliani arrived in Queens, he met with immigration officials to dissuade them from detaining the whole group without first investigating their individual situations. He was told then that the immigrants would remain in the custody of the Police Department last night.Armed with blankets and baby formula, the Red Cross began transporting vanfuls of children and adults to unspecified shelters just before 9 P.M. last night."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/06/nyregion/deaf-students-find-jobs-with-internships.html", "headline": "Deaf Students Find Jobs With Internships", "date": "1997-04-06T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from April 6, 1997, Section WC, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.THE laundry room at the Rye Town Hilton here is an impressive place: automated machines make short work of washing, drying, folding and sorting mountains of sheets and towels.But human operators, like Harold Fajardo, control them. He carefully places towels, with the embossed logo facing forward, into the folding machine. Every so often, he adjusts he computer to accommodate different sizes of bath towels, hand towels and washcloths. Mr. Fajardo, 20, is bright and able -- and deaf. This is his first job.Mr. Fajardo is one of a group of students from the New York School for the Deaf in White Plains, currently working as rotating interns in various departments of the hotel.When asked how he liked his job, Mr. Fajardoused sign language, which was interpreted by Dori Reeves, the job coach. Mr. Fajardo said: ''The laundry is my first choice. I especially enjoy operating the machines. My ambition is to stay at the hotel as one of their employees.'' One intern has already been hired permanently at the hotel, and another has found a full-time job at the Crowne Plaza in White Plains.The Rye Town Hilton began its cooperative education pilot program with the New York School for the Deaf on Sept. 9. On that day nine students from the school, ranging in age from 18 to 21, took jobs in different departments, based on their interests and abilities. The purpose was to give them an opportunity to get hands-on experience in various work areas of a hotel and togain a sense of what industry requires of them, said Ms. Reeves, a teacher at the school and the coach overseeing the students.''There are two of us, Pat Ribaudo and myself, who are the liaison between the students and the hotel staff,'' she said. ''We're always at the hotel when the students are working, to assist the hotel staff and to see that the program doesn't interfere with their own work. We do what needs doing: interpreting, trouble shooting, even at the beginning, helping our students make a bed or use a vacuum. We've seen our students become proficient in doing various jobs in the hotel, and even more important, working alongside hotel employees. They've gained the communication skills they need to succeed in a hearing world.''When January Ewell, an intern in the housekeeping department, was asked how she felt about working at the hotel, she recalled that at first she felt awkward, nervous and embarrassed. ''I thought people were looking at me,'' she said.'' Now I enjoy my job. I am learning a lot from Fay, my supervisor, about making beds and cleaning the guest rooms.''Most important, Ms. Ewell said, ''working here showed me that the hearing and deaf can work together and communicate without difficulty.''As the program enters its second term, it has been judged so successful that the school and the hotel have made a commitment to expand it next year. More students will be added and the hours they spend on the site will be increased.''The program has been spectacular,'' said Rochelle Delman, chairwoman of the school's vocational program. ''It was largely through the Hilton's commitment to career-oriented education and the efforts of Susan Marano, the hotel's director of marketing, that the program got off the ground. Because a hotel is a microcosm of the real world, students get the opportunity to get first-hand experience in many different work areas, which is different from what they have learned in a classroom setting. Our students are getting training in practical areas such as housekeeping, food service, engineering and office support.''Anthony Caraballo, 19, works in the kitchen under the direction of the hotel's executive steward, Roland Soloman. ''We've completed four job rotations of four weeks each, and the students have come a long way in that time,'' Mr. Soloman said. Their concentration is excellent, and we've had no problem with communication. As a matter of fact, our employees are picking up sign language. Anthony is working out very well on kitchen duty. He fits right in.''Mr. Caraballo said the hotel was very nice and he likes the people he works with. He added that he would like to stay in his present job.So would Marlon Bryant, 20, who is currently interning with John Cruise, who heads the hotel's engineering department. ''We do a bit of everything in this department,'' Mr. Cruise said. ''Wallpapering, plastering, woodworking. Marlon is becoming a regular Mr. Fixit.''Mr. Bryant said: ''I like the diversity, but painting is what I do best. I'd like a permanent job painting. ''Maeschand Laikram, 21, who was vacuuming the staircase, assessed his three job rotations. ''I've worked in the laundry, cleaned rooms, polished lamps and tables. I like hotel work, and the experience has paid off big for me. I applied for a real job, and I got it. I'm starting at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in White Plains, where I'll be working in the laundry. I want to earn money so I can get my own apartment.''Ms. Marano said that the school-to-work partnership has also been good for the hotel. ''Working alongside these students has made our employees more sensitive to the special needs of others,'' she said. ''Many of them have already learned the basics of communicating in sign language.''And the program has also resulted in the hiring of one participant for a full-time job in the hotel's housekeeping department.''When one of our longtime seamstresses recently retired, Sesam Al-Nemri, a 20-year-old intern, was encouraged to apply for the job,'' Ms. Marano said. ''She earned the post because of her skills, her diligence and her known ability as an intern to work well with the other members of the staff.''For Ms. Al-Nemri, receiving a paycheck every week is a heady experience. She lives with her family in Yonkers, and she said that her father is teaching her to drive. ''I would like to save enough money to buy my own car one day,'' she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/06/nyregion/studies-for-living-designed-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Studies for Living Designed for the Deaf", "date": "1997-04-06T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from April 6, 1997, Section 13CN, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.''DEAF people can do everything except hear,'' maintains Winfield McChord Jr., executive director of the American School for the Deaf in West Hartford. ''It is more than a school,'' he continued, ''it is to help the hearing-impaired live a full, purposeful life. We go beyond education.' On April 15, the school will celebrate its 180th anniversary, as the first school for the deaf in the country and the only one in Connecticut. It has become a model for the now 70 schools for the deaf around the nation. Situated on a rolling campus of 54 acres near the center of town, it has 14 buildings housing class rooms, dormitories, a gym, faculty housing and a Montessori school.The story of its founding begins in 1815. Mason Fitch Cogswell, a doctor in Hartford, had a young daughter, Alice, who was deaf. He obtained a book of signing from a French school and, despite the fact that there were no illustrations to guide him, he and Alice learned sign language together. Reading, however, defeated Alice until one day a neighbor, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, helped out.  Dr. Cogswell was so delighted that he asked Mr. Gallaudet to go to Europe to learn more. In 1815, however, Napoleon was about to be defeated at Waterloo, and France was closed. So Mr. Gallaudet visited England, where he met a teacher from the French school, Laurent Clerc, who agreed to go to Hartford with him and help start a school there, based on French signing.  When the school opened its doors, in temporary quarters, Alice Cogswell was its first student and Gallaudet was Head Master. In 1821, a school was built on Asylum Street, where the Hartford Insurance Company now stands, and 100 years later the present school was built. History remembers Gallaudet as a shy, retiring man, while Clerc seems to have been a colorful figure, the one to speak before a joint session of Congress to ask for funding for the school. Absolute silence followed that speech -- followed by a standing ovation. In 1821, President James Monroe gave the school a land grant of 23,000 acres in Alabama, which was sold to provide an an endowment, now valued at $19 million. Today, Peter Gallaudet, who says, ''I'm either the IV or V, I'll have to look it up,'' is a lawyer living in West Hartford and sitting on the Development Committee of the Board of Incorporators. Founders' Day is celebrated every year with a community open house and tours. There was an extensive program five years ago for the 175th anniversary, but this year the program will be primarily in-house.  Enrollment at the school, which had increased appreciably after World War II because of a nationwide rubella epidemic that left many infants deaf, dropped as these children moved through the school and as mainstreaming the deaf became more viable. Bolstered again by Mr. McChord's introduction of programs to include deaf children with special needs and with behavioral disorders, enrollment now stands at 250 students, with room for 150 more. Eighty-three percent are from Connecticut, about half are day students.  Some 55 percent of the school's approximately $11 million 1996-97 budget comes from the Connecticut General Assembly, with out-of-state school districts paying tuition for children from their communities. Additional funding comes from bequests, grants, corporate contributions and alumni. Annual tuition for the regular 180-day program is $23,000; for the resident program it is nearly $36,000. Tuition increases for students with special needs or behavioral problems, up to $89,000 for a full-time residential program. In all cases, the charges are met basically with public funding; parents are not charged.  The school, which is fully accredited, has programs for preschool through high school, including the usual academic courses, plus computer skills. ''They love computers, because they can talk to hearing people on the Internet,'' Mr. McChord says.  For families of students, the school organizes support groups, workshops and conferences. It provides an in-home counseling service for parents with hearing-impaired infants and toddlers. ''We want to reach them early, when language is most easily acquired,'' Mr. McChord said. An outreach into the entire deaf community includes programs like Adult Vocational Services, Community Audiological Services, state-wide sign language classes, a Center for Evaluation and Assessment and Hispanic classes. ''Three thousand people a month derive some kind of service from us; that's 36,000 a year, an impressive number,'' he said. To prepare for life in a hearing world, the school sponsors field trips with hearing children from a local elementary school, among other things. The upper school's vocational education courses cover more than a dozen fields from auto repairing to desktop publishing. After-school activities include an intermural athletic program with both deaf and hearing schools, off-campus jobs, scouting, junior achievement and drama. Eighty percent of the school's graduates go on to college or vocational schools.  The school's full year program has a summer day camp on campus that serves both hearing and deaf children and stresses communication between the two groups. At a sleep-away camp on an island in the Berkshires, the usual camp activities are offered to deaf children. Buildings for deaf schools need some modifications, Mr. McChord noted. ''If deaf children can't see, they can't hear.'' So teachers need lights to flash to get their attention, columns in rooms must be removed to allow better sight lines, halls need to be wider because when signing, a person needs space.  About a third of the 90 teachers and administrative personnel are deaf; the others are just as likely to use signing with everyone, hearing and not. ''It's force of habit,'' Mr. McChord explained. Mr. McChord's parents were both deaf, so American Sign Language was his first language. Deaf speakers use both A.S.L. and ''finger spelling'' for proper names. They also are taught to lip read.  ''It's very easy for signers to pick up a foreign language,'' Mr. McChord says, ''because A.S.L. is an ideological language, not a syntactical one.'' The school sponsors a two-week exchange program with a French school and every four years there is an international Deaf Olympics. ''It's wonderful to see children from different countries sitting together at a dinner table and signing in several languages,'' said Mr. McChord -- toddlers in baby talk and foreign students often with an accent."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/30/nyregion/mime-group-entertains-deaf-children.html", "headline": "Mime Group Entertains Deaf Children", "date": "1997-03-30T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from March 30, 1997, Section WC, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.MIME and acrobatic art ists and visual puns --flew fast and furiously across the Emelin Theater stage one morning recently, and the audience, largely deaf children from Westchester, was clearly enrapt.The action centered on a ''brick'' wall, or ''Mur-Mur,'' according to the French title of the show. Graffiti speckled the 10-foot plywood edifice. ''Danger'' was scrawled here, ''Bob and Lucy'' there. With jazz lofting and dipping in the background, the players spoke and signed only occasionally, allowing circus arts, for the most part, to replace the spoken word.Around and on top of the wall, two boys met two girls, with all the tender sensitivities that that can imply for adolescents. In addition, a bright-costumed character named ''Ralphie'' -- the quintessential younger brother -- tempted, teased, juggled, jumped and generally made an endearing pest of himself throughout the performance.The plot was loose and lyrical, the message appropriate and authentic, the energy level consistent and engaging.A young Montreal-based troupe, Dynamo Theater, founded in 1981, was responsible for ''Mur-Mur.'' The Emelin's executive director, David Watson, learned of the company at a booking conference.''I was intrigued right away,'' he recalled. ''It was unusual to find a talented theater group from abroad.''Moreover, he said, appealing to hearing-impaired children was an important factor in his choice. ''I wanted to open things up to a new audience,'' he said. ''In the last four or five years, there has only been one other event involving sign language at the Emelin. I consider this groundbreaking. We'll do more for the deaf in the future.''The audience was made up of young people, including students from the New York School for the Deaf in White Plains, and the hearing-impaired program sponsored by the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services at the Blind Brook Middle and High School in Rye Brook.Following the show, the cast perched casually on the stage apron and took questions from the audience.''Where did you get the idea for 'Mur-Mur'?''The wall was inspired by a street art wall in the South Bronx, designed by John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres. ''We wanted to make that wall come alive,'' one player said in a thick French-Canadian accent.''How much do you practice?'' another member of the audience asked.Louis-Martin Despa, who played Ralphie, said the players practice nine hours a week when they are at home in Canada and several hours ahead of a performance when they travel.''How did you learn to fall?''''We practiced.''''Have you ever had injuries?''Another player, Yvan Cote, answered: ''It's not too bad. A sprained ankle, a finger, a wrist.''''I like your baggy red pants,'' one student said to Ralphie.''Baggy pants are not exclusive to America,'' Ralphie said with a smile.The group told the audience that they are looking forward to a three-month stay in Japan, beginning in October.Donald Ruffin, a teacher with the New York School for the Deaf's Center for Creative Learning, said after the performance: ''Our kids enjoyed the show. They noticed some sign language on stage, and they thought it was quite fascinating. We usually go into the city for this kind of thing. The Emelin Theater was easy to get to. The teachers were happy to have something worthwhile in Westchester.''Mr. Ruffin said, ''Our kids understood the story, gestures, relationships.''A colleague of Mr. Ruffin, Mary DiYanni, said her 11- and 12-year-olds talked afterward about different vehicles in theater and mime. ''They really enjoyed the performance, because it was so visual,'' she said.Arlette Belkin of New Rochelle, who teaches in the Blind Brook program, said two of her students were moved to write thank-you notes.''It was really a great show for them,'' she said. ''I didn't know if they'd be at ease, but those letters told the story. They particularly liked the little guy, Ralphie, and the outfits the performers wore. And the children really liked asking questions afterward.''Trish Schwartz of White Plains served as interpreter. Mrs. Schwartz has worked with young deaf people since her years as a student at the College of St. Rose in Albany.She has been a professional interpreter for five years, she said, and learned about ''Mur-Mur'' from Mrs. Belkin.Mrs. Schwartz said that her husband, Michael, is deaf. They attended an earlier performance of the program for a mainstream audience to plan for the field trip.''My husband talked to the actors and taught them a few signs. They learned them immediately. Ralphie, in particular, got most of them,'' Mrs. Schwartz said.''I think it succeeded because it was universal. The company was able to communicate across language and age barriers. Everyone thought it was great.''Financial support for ''Mur-Mur'' came from the village of Mamaroneck, the town of Mamaroneck, the Westchester Arts Council, the Westchester Community Foundation, the Seth Sprague Educational and Charitable Foundation and the Lions Club of Mamaroneck."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/02/travel/disney-agrees-to-help-hearing-impaired.html", "headline": "Disney Agrees to Help Hearing Impaired", "date": "1997-03-02T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from March 2, 1997, Section 5, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The Walt Disney Company has agreed to add services to enable visitors with impaired hearing to better enjoy the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Disney M-G-M Studios theme parks in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., and Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.The agreement was reached with the Justice Department, which enforces the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and which approached Disney after receiving complaints. It specifies that sign-language interpreters will be provided on a regular schedule and captioning systems will be installed in attractions where feasible. More than 100 performances, parades and some rides will be affected by the agreement.A Disney spokesman, Bill Warren, said the project was in preparation for longer than two years before the agreement was announced in January. Some of the interpreters, captioning systems and devices to increase volume are already in place. The additions at Disneyland are scheduled to be complete by the end of the year.''Rear window captioning,'' a system developed in Boston that is used in some IMAX theaters, has been installed by Disney. The captions are projected from the rear of the auditorium onto Plexiglas panels to be adjusted by the viewer so the captions appear superimposed on the movie screen.Mr. Warren said that Disney had for some time been providing written scripts on request for most of its attractions. On rides like Space Ship Earth, hearing-impaired guests can ride again promptly.Under the agreement, announced Jan. 17 by Deval L.

She was 54.The cause was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Clive Robbins.She started her musical education at 8 and, by the time she finished high school, was an accomplished vocalist, church organist and accompanist. She earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in music education at the Crane School of Music at State University College in Potsdam, N.Y., and was certified as a teacher for youngsters with perceptual handicaps. She started training in music therapy in 1966 with Paul Nordoff and Dr. Robbins, founders of a creative music therapy practiced at schools in this country and Europe. Her own career began at the Little Red School House in Poughkeepsie.After she and Dr. Robbins were married in 1975, the couple worked as a team. They developed a music curriculum for the New York State School for the Deaf in Rome, N.Y., working with severely hearing-impaired youngsters.With Prof. Arthur Boothroyd they researched musical perception by such children as a basis for establishing techniques aimed at getting even the most profoundly deaf among them to play music.Mrs. Robbins's vocal and keyboard skills at improvisation added versatility to their work and freedom to explore. Together, the Robbinses wrote ''Music for the Hearing Impaired and Other Special Groups: A Resource Manual and Curriculum Guide'' (MMB Music, 1980), a standard text in this specialized field.She taught Nordoff-Robbins music therapy at institutes and schools in London, Germany and Japan and traveled worldwide to lecture and teach. She and Dr. Robbins returned to this country in 1989 to establish and direct the center at N.Y.U. within the Graduate Music Therapy Program, where it provides treatment, training and research.In addition to her husband, Mrs. Robbins is survived by a daughter, Debra Matteson of Ilion, N.Y.; her mother, Adalyn Matteson, and her siblings, Christine Phinney and David Matteson, all of Oswego."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/15/nyregion/paper-mill-playhouse-tries-captioning-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Paper Mill Playhouse Tries Captioning for the Deaf", "date": "1996-12-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "For years, John McEwen would send deaf or hard-of-hearing theatergoers the scripts of plays and musicals being produced at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, where he is the director of development. That would give those accustomed to lip-reading during performances a head start.Although each production offered two sign-interpreted performances, as well as infrared listening devices at every show, ''it wasn't enough,'' Mr. McEwen said. So Paper Mill is experimenting with an open-captioning system.''Some people don't benefit from listening enhancement devices, and some don't read American Sign Language,'' he said. ''Only open captioning can complete their theater experience.''Although Mr. McEwen had plans for starting such a service at Paper Mill, it wasn't until 20 deaf patrons ''pushed me to the next step,'' he said. The group from the Alexander Graham Bell Association, a nationwide organization for the deaf, was attending a meeting in Manhattan and chose to see a Paper Mill production rather than a Broadway show because it considered the theater ''an arts access model,'' said Laura Aden, executive director of the New Jersey Theater Group.The group saw a performance of ''Applause'' during which captions appeared on an onstage television screen. That performance made Paper Mill the first theater on the West Coast to present open captioning.For ''Gigi,'' which closes today, Mr. McEwen hired Donald DePew, a Manhattan-based director of arts and services for the hard of hearing, to set up a system by which text and occasional stage directions were flashed on an onstage digital screen, two lines at a time..''Now I'm going to put them together,'' Mr. McEwen said of signed and open-captioned performances.

He fooled his mother until he was 5. He fooled his pediatrician, too.Betty Oberlander had her suspicions, though. Her son was extremely quiet, called her ''Nanny'' instead of ''Mommy'' and spoke with a funny lisp. But the pediatrician called Mrs. Oberlander a worry wart. ''Here, George, have a cookie,'' the pediatrician said. George took the cookie, and that was the extent of the testing.But when George was 5, Mrs. Oberlander had proof. It came as she spoke while looking out the kitchen window. ''Turn around,'' George told her. ''I can't see what you're saying.''Even today, the 34-year-old Mr. Oberlander continues to fool people. He speaks normally. He appears to hear every word said, on the phone or in person. Yet, the Harrison resident cannot hear without his hearing aids, and even then, he picks up only 30 percent of surrounding sounds. He needs to watch people's lips and gestures for clues to what they are saying. He concentrates hard, but does not pick up every word.Despite this disadvantage, Mr. Oberlander is a senior associate and senior engineer at the Manhattan headquarters of Syska & Hennessy, a national engineering consulting firm. During the summer, he worked from 7 A.M. to as late as 9:30 P.M.He attends meetings and runs them. He answers the telephone. If he does not hear the phone after three rings, a red light flashes. Then, he picks up and holds the phone upside down, amplifying the earpiece against a body aid, an electronic device tucked inside his shirt, which amplifies and clarifies sounds for him.He brings his own clients, like NBC, the Central Park Zoo, Rockefeller Center and the state of New Jersey, to the company.He has triumphed in a speaking world. ''To be an engineer and to be hard of hearing and to accomplish what he did is great,'' said Florence Rosen, director of career development services at the League for the Hard of Hearing in Manhattan. The league offers many services to deaf people, like hearing evaluations, educational programs, job placement, career development and counseling.Mr. Oberlander said he is determined to succeed in the corporate, hearing world. He is tough from having struggled throughout his life and is used to working harder. Mr. Oberlander is a project manager. He appreciates employees who work hard and do the best they can all the time. He likes to see what he sees in himself, what he calls ''the desire to succeed.''He is outspoken, saying what he thinks even if he knows it is not what other deaf people think. For example, Mr. Oberlander knows only the signs for hello and goodbye in American Sign Language.That sums up his curt relationship with deaf language and culture. ''If you want to function in the real world, you have to be oral,'' Mr. Oberlander said at the Rye Brook home of Dr. Beatrice Spear, his former Harrison Central School District teacher. ''It was my choice to be oral. Other people may choose otherwise. That is their choice.''Dr. Spear said: ''If you just consider the handicap, he's amazing. Most people with his handicap don't succeed as well.'' She attributed his success to what she called ''his perseverance, his personality and his drive.''Mr. Oberlander graduated from Hofstra University in 1985 with a bachelor's degree in engineering science. He volunteers as a lecturer and mentor at the League for the Hard of Hearing. Mrs. Rosen said that Mr. Oberlander has been an inspiration to younger league members. ''I think they marveled at what he did and how he did it,'' she said.Mr. Oberlander said he volunteers ''because other people did it for me.''The first person to help Mr. Oberlander was Irwin Rickler, his first speech teacher. Then in seventh grade came Dr. Spear. She worked with Mr. Oberlander's classroom teacher as a consultant, helping Mr. Oberlander and other handicapped students enter the mainstream.At the time, Dr. Spear worked for the Board of Cooperative Educational Services in Harrison. She is now an education administrator at the New York City Board of Education. From 1974 until 1980, when Mr. Oberlander graduated, she helped him become part of the regular classes. She has been his mentor and friend since.For one hour during each school day, Dr. Spear helped Mr. Oberlander comprehend everything that had been taught in class. Even when he listened and studied his teacher's lips, he could not grasp everything. ''Since I was spending so much time trying to understand the words, it was hard for me to comprehend what the teacher meant,'' Mr. Oberlander said.Dr. Spear ''filled in the blanks,'' he said, helping him in every subject. She suggested that Mr. Oberlander sit in the front row, and she advised his teachers on how to help him. He spent many hours at her house or talking to her on the phone. She helped him prepare a ninth-grade speech on UFO's. ''She's the reason I can stand up in front of 250 people and speak, no problem,'' Mr. Oberlander said. She gave him the skill and confidence he needed.''Together, one on one, they were able to accomplish great things,'' Mrs. Oberlander said.His mother helped, too. Mr. Oberlander said he believes he could not have made it through school if his mother had worked outside the home. She was there, waiting for him, when he needed additional help in understanding the day's lessons. If there had been a movie shown in school that day, she borrowed the film and wrote down the words for her son. ''I would not have done what I did if she had come home from work at 9 every night,'' Mr. Oberlander said.''Every day was difficult because he had to work so hard to keep up,'' Mrs. Oberlander said. Her son would want to play after school, and he could not. He needed that time to catch up to his classmates.Mr. Oberlander will say that he did not succeed on his own. ''Anybody who says they did it by themselves is lying through their teeth,'' Mr. Oberlander said. ''I did what I did because of people like my mother, my father and Bea.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/20/nyregion/alan-barwiolek-43-is-dead-an-actor-despite-deafness.html", "headline": "Alan Barwiolek, 43, Is Dead; An Actor, Despite Deafness", "date": "1996-04-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from April 20, 1996, Section 1, Page 50Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

He was 43 and had been associate professor of sign language studies at Union College in Plainfield, N.J.His companion, Tony Allicino, said that Mr. Barwick, who had AIDS, collapsed and died at the door to the hospital's outpatient clinic. He had arrived to get a blood transfusion after spending a typically strenuous week conducting workshops and making personal appearances on behalf of the deaf.In a nation in which 25 million people have some hearing impairment, Mr. Barwiolek, or Al B, as he was known to those who found Barwiolek (pronounced BAR-we-oh-lick) as difficult to sign as to spell, was among the 2.5 million or so who are profoundly deaf, unable to hear at all.Mr. Barwiolek, a native of Greensburg, Pa., whose parents were also deaf and who had a deaf sister, was known as strong deaf, a term meaning the condition has a strong genetic component. Growing up deaf in a deaf family left Mr. Barwiolek with no sense of personal limitation, although it must have appeared quixotic when, as the first member of his family to attend college, he chose to major in drama with the intention of becoming an actor.There were virtually no professional opportunities for actors who spoke only sign language. Even in New York, where Mr. Barwiolek obtained a master's degree in educational theater from New York University in 1975, there was no deaf theater company, at least until 1979, when Mr. Barwiolek and a group of fellow actors started one and turned it into a magnet for deaf and hearing audiences alike.Unlike conventional theater, in which simultaneous sign language translations are rare (and sometimes hidden in the shadows), New York Deaf Theater productions, staged at various rented theaters, offer full-throated vocal translations.Mr. Barwiolek, who appeared in several productions and directed several others, among them \"A Play of Our Own,\" \"Veronica's Room,\" and \"25 Cents,\" could not support himself with his theater work, which included international tours with a partner, J. Charlie McKinney, in a series of satires on deaf culture.To make ends meet, he spent 10 years doing social work as a deaf-blind specialist with the New Jersey Commission for the Blind, and in 1986 took the job at Union College, which offers the only degree program in interpretation for the deaf in the New York area.He was also something of an underground investigator, who knew his rights under the Americans With Diabilities Act and took fierce pleasure in denouncing, say, hotels that had no teletype phones.And woe betide the waiter who grumbled at having to write down the day's restaurant specials. Mr. Barwiolek would invariably scan the laboriously written list, then order something from the printed menu.In addition to Mr. Allicino, he is survived by his father, Stanley, of Jeannette, Pa."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/03/news/sunday-march-3-1996-sign-language-an-urban-sideshow.html", "headline": "Sunday March 3, 1996: SIGN LANGUAGE;An Urban Sideshow", "date": "1996-03-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from March 3, 1996, Section 6, Page 29Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Wisher, a former Gallaudet University athletic coach who was so struck by the graceful flow of his students' sign language that he choreographed their hand movements into an acclaimed genre of dance for the deaf, died on Sunday at the Veterans Hospital in Washington. He was 84.Mr. Wisher had been recuperating from injuries suffered in an automobile accident last April.Before he took up his position as coach and professor of physical education at Gallaudet, the school for the deaf in Washington, Mr. Wisher, a former assistant basketball coach at the University of Maryland, spent the summer of 1955 learning American Sign Language.But it was not until that fall, when he watched Gallaudet students signing the Lord's Prayer in a campus ceremony, that he had a vision of the hands as bodies on a stage.In short order he created a new form of dance, one marked by large, exaggerated movements involving hands, arms and bodies. Although the prayer and countless other works that followed are perceived by most hearing audiences as dance, to those who know American Sign Language they are also opera since the dancers, moving in synchronization with the music they never hear, use the movement of their bodies to sign the lyrics they cannot sing.Mr. Wisher's students, whose previous forays into dance had been limited to private, often furtive, mimicry of standard dance forms, were so enchanted by his initial exercises in choreography that he formed the college's first performing dance troupe, the Gallaudet Dance Company.By the time he retired as athletic director in 1981, successive versions of the company had made national and international tours and performed on television.For Mr. Wisher, an all-around athlete who coached everything from swimming to wrestling, the leap from athletics to dance was hardly a stretch.He and his wife, Anne, had been involved in dance since their days on the gymnastics team at East Stroudsburg State College in Pennsylvania.\"We even operated a Fred Astaire dance studio,\" Mrs. Wisher said yesterday, recalling that she and her husband also spent a summer at Connecticut College in the late 1940's studying with some of the greats of modern dance including Martha Graham, Charles Weidman and Doris Humphrey.Indeed, Mr. Wisher, who obtained a master's degree and a doctorate in physical education from Penn State University, regarded dance as such an integral part of the athletic experience that his doctoral thesis was \"A Modern Dance Manual for Male Teachers of Physical Education.\"In a peripatetic coaching career, he routinely used dance both as a training regimen and as a full-fledged sport, often selecting the burliest athletes and transforming them into a performing dance troupe.\"He wanted to counter the idea that men's dancing was somehow sissified,\" Mrs. Wisher explained.Mr. Wisher, whose high school specialties had been diving, hurdling, pole vaulting and high jumping, did not see dance so much as a form of athletics as he saw athletics as a variation of dance.\"Movement,\" he once said, \"was the prime interest in my life.\"Mr. Wisher, the son of a Polish immigrant, was born in Shenandoah, Pa. His original name was Wiskersky, but he changed it after college, his wife said, as the only way he could get a job in an era of ethnic prejudice.His father was killed in a coal mining accident when Mr. Wisher was 6, qualifying the youngster for a free primary and secondary education at the Girard College boarding school in Philadelphia, an experience he attributed to changing the course of his life.\"He always said that if it hadn't been for Girard he would have become a coal miner, too,\" Mrs. Wisher said.Mr. Wisher, who served in the Navy during World War II and was coaching at Maryland when he was recalled to active duty during the Korean conflict, came to Gallaudet by accident.\"Maryland saved his job for him, but not his seniority,\" said his wife, recalling that her husband was so miffed by what he saw as an injustice that he started looking for another job and found one at Gallaudet, a college he had never heard of.Mr. Wisher had also never known a deaf person before. It gave him a certain advantage at a time when sign language was actively discouraged by traditional educators of the deaf, and the belief that those who could not hear music could not dance was so ingrained that it took someone who did not know any better to show the deaf and the world otherwise.In addition to his wife, of College Park, Md., he is survived by a daughter, Judee Thompson-Judy of Waldorf, Md.; a sister, Anna Benjamin of Forty Fort, Pa., and a brother, Anthony Wisher of Reading, Pa."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/08/nyregion/new-york-school-for-the-deaf-stresses-need-for-early-training.html", "headline": "New York School for the Deaf Stresses Need for Early Training", "date": "1995-10-08T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 8, 1995, Section WC, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

They saw a flashing strobe light, which prompted them to stand up and wave the fingers on their hand and then move their left fist across their outstretched right index finger, indicating in sign language: \"Fire Practice.\"They filed out of the building behind their teacher, holding hands as all preschoolers are taught to do. What makes this fire drill different is that Nathan and his classmates are deaf.The New York School for the Deaf here is one of the oldest institutions in America dedicated to teaching deaf children. Fanwood, as it is commonly known for its original site in Manhattan, has always been at the forefront of promoting the rights of the hearing impaired. Through their early childhood intervention program they are enabling students to develop the basic communication skills that are the building blocks for highly functioning adults.\"We call the program an infant program, but we are also training the parents in auditory awareness,\" said Nancy Howard, principal of Fanwood. \"This little deaf child is probably the first deaf person they ever met, so it is very foreign and frightening to them.\"The program starts with frequent home visits by teachers and trainers, and then at about 14 months they start coming to the school for interaction and play with other deaf children. Signing is used immediately, and parents are strenuously encouraged to learn American Sign through the school. Toddlers start out using rudimentary signs, which are similar to baby talk.The early-intervention program begins with sign language as the primary means of communication. The deaf community is divided on the issue of using signs or teaching oral communication through lip reading and speech training. The philosophy of Fanwood is to use both but to introduce intense signing at the earliest stages.Tammy Rogers, a preschool teacher who originally taught in an oral-only program, said she believed that exclusively teaching oral communication in the early years is too frustrating for students and teachers. \"Lip-reading skills develop more when you have a communication base of sign language,\" Ms. Rogers said.The children begin to communicate with visual aids like drawing and writing, and as a result, written communication develops more quickly for deaf students.Without early intervention, deaf children enter school far behind hearing children, who usually begin school with a sizable vocabulary. Basic concepts like where an apple comes from or what it is called are usually absent with deaf children. \"The hearing component has to be set up and modeled for a deaf child so that they have a starting point for a teacher to build on,\" Ms. Howard said.Ninety percent of the 500,000 deaf people in the United States are born to hearing parents. The cause of deafness is usually genetic, but many children lose their hearing from illness, fever or adverse drug reactions. People are considered profoundly deaf if they have 80- to 100-decibel hearing loss.For a child living in a hearing home, daily life can be so frustrating that it leads to behavioral problems. If the deafness is not diagnosed early, children may live for years not knowing their name.Deborah Lee Rose, an assistant preschool teacher who is deaf, came to Fanwood when she was 3. She came from a hearing family in Poughkeepsie where she was unable to communicate with her parents. \"I felt helpless and my parents felt helpless until I started coming here,\" Ms. Lee Rose said.In 1975 the Education of the Handicapped Act required school districts to teach handicapped children in the same schools they would attend if they were not handicapped. While this was perceived by many as a civil-rights victory for the handicapped, it was vehemently opposed by many members of the deaf community. Most had had frustrating experiences in mainstream education and by this point the deaf community was independent and self-supporting with its own university, Gallaudet in Washington.Dr. Robert Davila, the headmaster at Fanwood, is a strong opponent of mandatory mainstream education for the deaf. As the Assistant Secretary for Special Education under President George Bush, he achieved the highest rank in Federal service ever attained by a deaf person. He opposed initiatives to include the deaf in mandates for mainstream education for all handicapped Americans.\"I could not come out as a total inclusionist on this issue,\" said Dr. Davila. \"Mainstreaming has hurt the deaf in a lot of ways.\"At Fanwood there is constant discussion of deaf culture. Like many minority groups, the deaf have their own language and an intense feeling of camaraderie, which comes from common experience and frustration. The week of Sept. 24 was Deaf Awareness Week, and the campus was the center of many activities,ranging from theater to forums on issues within the community.Interpretive services have become a growing occupation as more deaf adults are working in the hearing world. Many interpreters at Fanwood are hearing children of deaf parents who learned sign language as infants so they could communicate with their parents.Technology has expanded the horizons of deaf people over the last 10 years. Closed captioning on television and film, teletype communication and the Internet have alleviated some of the most common frustrations. In the past, deaf people had to go to a foreign movie to take advantage of subtitles or drive to someone's house to find out if the person they wanted to see was home.Technology has also improved early intervention. Custom-made amplification devices with FM communicators used by teachers help focus on individual needs. Computer programs with strong visual emphasis give children cognitive training, which doesn't require spoken communication.Early in the 20th century, Fanwood students were trained to be printers and milliners so they could have a vocation that would not require spoken communication. Now through early intervention the possibilities have greatly expanded.\"By using your hand, the highest number that you can count to without speech is the number 5,\" Ms. Howard said. \"But here, using sign language, you can count to a million.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/09/theater/theater-review-gay-jewish-and-deaf-the-limits-on-sharing.html", "headline": "Gay, Jewish and Deaf: The Limits on Sharing", "date": "1995-09-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from September 9, 1995, Section 1, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

And when characters in this earnest, thoughtful work, which is performed at the Vineyard Theater in a combination of spoken English and American Sign Language, ask, \"What word am I looking for?\" there's no guarantee of a satisfactory answer.The most bracing point made in this portrait of a Seattle architect trying to sort out the conflicting claims of being gay, Jewish and deaf, is that each person's vocabulary is unique, with all the limitations and potential that implies.Albert Rose (Mr. Merkin), the play's protagonist, comes to realize he will never be entirely understood by either his cautious, conventional parents (Michael P. Ralph and Margaret Arnold), who are deaf, or by his old-world grandmother (Helen Slayton-Hughes) and his thoroughly modern lover (Jon Wolfe Nelson), who are not. The idea of any fully shared language is, it seems, only a myth.While the conclusions of \"Language,\" directed with polish by Mr. Emery, are far from facile, its presentation of them can be, suggesting the precise, good-willed didacticism of an After School Special. The play makes its points very clearly but often at excessive length and at the expense of specific characterization. This is mostly a dialogue of archetypes: between parents and child, the deaf and the hearing and lovers from different worlds.The production does ingeniously sidestep the tedium of straightforward simultaneous translation by giving its main characters \"shadows,\" or interior selves, who turn signed language into spoken words and vice versa. Often one finds oneself confusing the two, and there are some funny, acutely observed social scenes that explore the frustrating levels of possibility for misinterpretation.Among the appealing cast, Mr. Merkin, in particular, has a fluid, cleanly defined expressiveness that reminds us that the theater can be an ideal medium for sign language. LANGUAGE OF ONE By Drew Emery and Lewis Merkin; directed by Mr. Emery; sets by Beowulf Boritt; costumes by Elizabeth Hope Clancy; lighting by Ellen E. Bone; sound by Mr. Emery.

You saved me,\" the 15-year-old girl, Sonya Kinney, said after the hearing, speaking through an interpreter as she clung to her new guardian, Joanie Hughes.The girl's mother, Christyne Kinney Estes, who did not attend the hearing, told social-service investigators that she believed the child should not rely on sign language and should develop her speaking skills, according to court records. Sonya uses hearing aids in both ears and can understand someone speaking slowly using simple words.The girl's father, Norman Kinney, testified at the hearing that he had never learned sign language because he felt guilty about Sonya's disability. He said that he would now learn sign language if Sonya would live with him and teach it to him.Ms. Hughes, 40, was hired in 1987 by the New Hanover County school district to interpret for Sonya, the first deaf child to enter a county elementary school under a program that integrates handicapped and nonhandicapped students.After the parents' divorce, custody of Sonya, her twin brother and her two older sisters was given in 1986 to her mother, who remarried. Mr. Kinney moved to Florida and is more than $20,000 behind in child support payments, court records show.In 1990, Mr. Kinney moved back to Wilmington and briefly lived with his children, his former wife and her husband in a trailer.In her lawsuit seeking permanent custody of Sonya, Ms. Hughes asserted that both parents were unfit. Social-service investigators testified at the hearing that they had removed Sonya from her mother's home after contentions that she had been sexually abused by her stepfather. No charges were filed against the stepfather, who died in January.In her decision, Judge Holt said that both parents' failure to learn sign language had prevented Sonya from communicating her fears about her stepfather.In January, Sonya and her twin brother moved in with Mr. Kinney, who works as a house painter.At the hearing, Mr. Kinney acknowledged that he had a drinking problem but said that he had controlled it somewhat.In March, according to testimony, Sonya asked her father if she could live with Ms. Hughes, and Mr. Kinney agreed. But later he argued with Sonya about her Social Security disability check, refusing to give her the $458 she received each month. Then he demanded that she move back in with him, but under a court order she had remained in Ms. Hughes's temporary custody.Ms. Hughes is divorced and lives with her two daughters, Traci, 21, also a sign-language interpreter, and Kelli, 19.Mr. Kinney said he would appeal the court's decision.\"My old family is very mad, and I'm very sad about that,\" Sonya said after the hearing."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/13/nyregion/helping-hands-aren-t-always-outstretched-to-deaf-blind.html", "headline": "Helping Hands Aren't Always Outstretched to Deaf-Blind", "date": "1995-05-13T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 13, 1995, Section 1, Page 21Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

She maneuvers her way around Manhattan using a cane, and wearing a sign that asks for help crossing streets. She talks on the phone using a teletype machine hooked up to a Braille translator. She communicates with her son by sign language that he speaks into her palms.One thing she clearly cannot do is read a typewritten letter, like the one the state sent her six months ago to tell her that she was losing her state assistance. It was only when Ms. Jackson called the state to request repairs to her Braille machine, her link to the world, that she learned she was no longer a state client.\"It was like throwing ice water in my face,\" she said in an interview using her Braille machine at her sparsely furnished East 14th Street apartment.Like Ms. Jackson, other deaf-blind people, their relatives, and even some of their social workers say they consider the state social service bureaucracy insensitive and often unhelpful to the deaf-blind. They say that deaf-blind people often find themselves caught between two state agencies, one for the deaf and the other for the blind, and that neither agency has mastered what it takes to help people with both disabilities. They tell of waiting one to three years to get even the most basic equipment and services, like a walking cane, transportation to a job, or training on how to get around their neighborhood.Social workers and disability specialists say the deaf-blind often fall between the cracks of the state system because their numbers are relatively small and they often literally cannot voice their complaints. The State Commission for the Blind has been particularly slow to adjust to their needs, they say: until recently, none of the counselors for the deaf-blind clients even spoke sign language -- which can be \"spoken\" into a hand.The Commission for the Blind, a division of the State Department of Social Services, serves about 100 deaf-blind people in New York City, a total of 450 deaf-blind clients throughout the state. In addition to rehabilitation and vocational training, the commission also provides mobility and communications equipment to the deaf-blind.Daniel Callahan, the State Commission for the Blind's regional director in New York City, would not comment on specific cases, but defended his agency's work with the deaf-blind.\"There have been some pretty dramatic improvements in services for the deaf-blind in the last two years,\" he said. \"Maybe we're not moving fast enough, but we're moving in the right direction.\"Joe Cioffi, a rehabilitation specialist for the deaf-blind who has worked for the commission for 14 years, said he had become increasingly frustrated by what he sees as the agency's cavalier attitude toward his clients -- a problem he never encounters in New Jersey, he added.\"The deaf-blind are the easiest group to sweep under the rug because they can't just pick up the phone and complain, and to a large extent they live in total social isolation,\" he said.Harvey Kwitkin, for example, has been waiting for a year and a half to get van service so he can rejoin the labor force. The 59-year-old deaf man suffers from Usher's syndrome, a congenital disease that causes about 6 percent of the deaf population to go blind gradually. People suffering from Usher's syndrome, which has no cure, account for about half of the deaf-blind population in New York. Other major causes of deaf-blindness include rubella and diabetes.Until his eyesight started to fail, Mr. Kwitkin worked for a Long Island pharmaceutical company for nearly 30 years, filling packages and stuffing envelopes. Mr. Kwitkin continues to ride the subway on a familiar route from his Manhattan apartment to his barber in Brooklyn, but he has accepted his need for special transportation to get to a new job, said Mr. Kwitkin's brother, Beryl.\"We worry about his traveling on his own all the time, but to tell him to stop would decrease his independence, and that's all he's got,\" Beryl Kwitkin said. \"We're not asking for more than he's entitled to. He just wants to be able to work again.\"Harris Hand, who also has Usher's syndrome, first sought help from the commission in the summer of 1993 when he realized he could no longer safely get from his apartment in Co-op City in the northeast Bronx to his clerical job at the New York Society for Certified Public Accountants in midtown Manhattan.In the 13 months it took for the commission to evaluate him and get him a walking cane, he had several near accidents in city traffic, and one outright accident: a taxi drove over his right foot, he said. Mr. Hand did not buy a cane on his own because he didn't know what kind to get or how to use one.\"I worry a lot about the fact that I am going blind,\" Mr. Hand said. \"I'm getting an ulcer thinking about it, because I've heard stories about how hard it is to get things from the commission. I'm very afraid they will close my case, and then what will happen to me?\"Assemblyman Steven Sanders recently held hearings in New York City and in Rochester on the needs of the deaf and deaf-blind.\"What we heard was shocking, and it wasn't so much a lack of services as it was a total lack of sensitivity on the part of the very people who are empowered to be advocates for the deaf-blind,\" he said. \"There definitely has been a pattern of neglect that borders on malfeasance.\"Mr. Sanders has asked the Governor's office to investigate the commission and to re-examine several cases, including Ms. Jackson's.Donna Leshne, a counselor with Vocational Educational Services for Individuals With Disabilities, a state agency that works with the deaf, said a fundamental problem is that jurisdictional rules prohibit a deaf-blind person from having an open case both at her agency and at the Commission for the Blind.Past experiences with deaf-blind clients who have become lost in the system have provoked Ms. Leshne to go out of her way to keep her clients out of the commission's jurisdiction. \"I'll go in a back door to get them information and services,\" she said.Serving the deaf-blind is also complicated by cultural differences that separate the deaf and blind communities.Deaf people in many ways form a separate culture, because they have a language, Ms. Leshne said. \"Very often, blind people don't identify with deaf people for the same reason sighted people don't, because they don't speak the language,\" she said.For Ms. Jackson, seven years of struggling with the commission is enough. Ms. Jackson, who went blind 14 years ago and deaf 7 years ago, plans to leave New York for Pittsburgh. \"From what I've heard, the services for the deaf-blind are better there,\" she said.Ms. Jackson said she understood that services for the deaf-blind can be expensive, particularly for clients like her. She wants to go to college and eventually get a job working with computers. But while the State Commission for the Blind has provided her with special phone equipment and has given her mobility training to help her learn her neighborhood, it will not give her transportation to a college, an interpreter to help her understand lectures, or a reader to help her with printed school materials.Ms. Jackson said she was told she was being cut off because she would not enroll in a sheltered workshop where she would work packaging items or performing other forms of what she considers menial labor. Commission officials declined to comment on Ms. Jackson's case, but the letter she received from the agency classified her vocational goal as \"homemaker\" and said her case was being closed because she had \"made a satisfactory vocational adjustment.\"\"I don't think I'm better than anybody else, but I have better skills than that,\" she said. Before she completely lost her hearing, Ms. Jackson taught Braille.The underemployment of deaf-blind people is just a symptom of an attitude that permeates the commission, she said.\"By not admitting we have skills, they don't have to dish out money to give us things that we deserve, things like better education and transportation,\" Ms. Jackson said. \"They don't want to admit that if we are given the chance and the proper kind of help, we can do just about anything.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/nyregion/about-long-island-deaf-team-carries-on-to-a-0-14-record.html", "headline": "Deaf Team Carries On, to a 0-14 Record", "date": "1995-03-05T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 5, 1995, Section LI, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

But for 25 years there has always been a season for the boys' varsity basketball team at the Mill Neck Manor School for Deaf Children.\"It's such a tradition here,\" the principal, Dennis Tobin, said. \"If just one kid benefits from it we'll keep the team going.\"The only deaf team in a league of private high schools on Long Island, Mill Neck Manor has a record of 0and 14. The roster stands at only six players, including one girl. At times the fans in the bleachers number even less. Yet the team plays on.\"It doesn't matter that we have a losing record,\" Andre Colon, 15, said through a sign-language interpreter, Anna Marie Trotta. \"Or that we don't have many players. I am proud of what I do. I am proud to be on this team.\"At Mill Neck basketball is a game of sight, with little sound. Communication between the coach and the team members, and the cheerleaders and the fans, is all in sign language. That can be a plus in a close game, the coach, Tim Sorrentino, said. \"I'm supposed to stay in the coach's box. But because I'm signing to the players the refs let me go further. I use that to my advantage.\"At a game against Old Westbury School of the Holy Child, Mr. Sorrentino raced back and forth along the sidelines, signing encouragement to his players. His team had taken an early lead.\"What's different about a game with a deaf team,\" the referee, Ed Rua, said, \"is they don't have any crowd reaction when they score.\"There was reaction. Mr. Rua just didn't see it.\"It's different for the hearing culture,\" Nidia Chevez, Mill Neck's point guard said through the interpreter. \"They go, 'Wow!' or, 'Yeah!' when someone scores. In deaf culture we cheer with our bodies.\" Instead of clapping, fans wave their hands over their heads. \"That way we can see them,\" she said.Waving and smiling were the Mill Neck cheerleaders, who never stopped trying to rally their team. One minute they were signing \"C-H-I-E-F-S,\" the team nickname. The next minute they were trying to form a pyramid. \"It's important to them that they come out and support the team,\" said Christine Zembar, the cheerleading coach.In many ways the basketball team serves as a symbol for the Mill Neck students. It is an opportunity, school personnel say, to show the world that regardless of disability there is no difference in a child's desire to compete and excel.For more than 20 years Mill Neck has played \"hearing schools,\" as the students call them. When enrollment was high, the team did well. In 1988 its record was 19 and 2. But with medical advances, fewer children have been born deaf, and fewer students need to attend specialized schools.\"For many years rubella was the No. 1 cause of deafness in children,\" Mr. Tobin said. \"But the medical profession figured out how to control it, and we had no more deaf babies.\"Mainstreaming, too, has been a factor. Today the school, which takes students from Queens, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, has a total enrollment of 90, compared with 193 in the early 80's. In the junior and senior high division there are 33 students. That means almost 20 percent of that student body has to play basketball to field a varsity team.Last year there were only five players, and in a tournament game one fouled out. \"So we played with four,\" Mr. Sorrentino said. \"And we won.\" They also won the tournament's Sportsmanship Award.This year the team has one substitute, but it is not Miss Chevez, 17, of Hempstead, the only girl to play in the boys' league. At 5 foot 1, she has earned a position as starting point guard, \"She's a hustler,\" Mr. Sorrentino said. At a tournament for deaf schools last weekend she made the all-star second team.Nidia was born with hearing but lost it at 1 1/2 after a high fever. Her basketball prowess began when her three brothers \"forced me into it,\" she said. \"They wanted to play 2 on 2. They needed a fourth. That was O.K. with me. I was always a tomboy.\"Playing in a boys' league has its challenges, she said. Traveling to away games she has to wear her uniform under her clothes, because she never knows what the facilities for her will be. At home games she has the spacious girls' locker room all to herself.Perched atop a hill in one of the most affluent communities on the North Shore, Mill Neck seems an idyllic setting for sports and learning. The nearest neighbor is the chairman of the Long Island Lighting Company, William J. Catacosinos.Formerly called the Lutheran School for the Deaf, Mill Neck is privately owned, but state financed. Students are bused in, which makes it difficult for them to get together off school grounds. It is up to teachers like Mr. Sorrentino, the physical education instructor, to establish an esprit de corps.At 5 foot 4, Mr. Sorrentino may be one of the shortest coaches in basketball, but he has always loved the game. He is hearing impaired and grew up in a deaf family. When he was a student at Malverne High School, he said, \"I wasn't permitted to play basketball there because of my hearing problem. The school doctors were afraid it might endanger what little hearing I had. So I played in a C.Y.O. league. I averaged 15 points a game.\"On the current Mill Neck team, only one player, Tommy Paulay, 17, of Wantagh averages more than that. Tommy's average is 16. Nidia is second highest, with 6. Israel Guerrero is the third highest scorer.For players like Imran Alam, 18, and Mandeep Singh, 15, the sport of basketball is new. \"This is my first year playing,\" Imran signed. \"I am the rookie.\"With a bit more basketball experience is Andre Colon of Flushing. \"When I was about 9,\" he signed, \"I started playing with my hearing friends. I was born deaf. But my whole family can hear. Sometimes I wish my family was deaf. I think it would be easier to communicate with them.\"Little communication is needed on the court, he said, even with his hearing friends. \"Most of the time we used body language.\"This may be one of the few sports teams that doesn't have special hand signals for plays. \"That's because all our signs mean words,\" Mr. Sorrentino said, \"which is fine until you play another deaf team. Then they can read what you're saying.\"At a game against a hearing school, Holy Child, the only noise in the gymnasium was the squeak from sneakers on the hardwood floor. \"It's a different kind of game when we play them,\" the captain of Holy Child, Chris Caputo, said. \"They're not talking but still they're playing. You have to pick up your level, because they're not clapping or shouting to each other. There is little emotion out there.'Maybe not verbally, but physically Mill Neck was a blur of intensity. With dribbling, shooting and signing, the five players never stopped moving.For all their enthusiasm, they draw little fan support. At the Holy Child game, just five people were in the stands rooting them on. All worked at the school.\"My parents have never seen me cheer,\" signed a cheerleader, Chrissie Laurice of Huntington.It is even difficult to get students to the games. They are concerned about missing their buses home.But for the boys' varsity of Mill Neck, the passion in playing is not measured by the cheers of a crowd. It's the same as in city playgrounds or under a suburban hoop attached to the garage.\"For us,\" Nidia signed, \"the joy is in seeing the ball go in the basket.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/04/nyregion/sign-language-teachers-halt-suicide.html", "headline": "Sign Language Teachers Halt Suicide", "date": "1995-03-04T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 4, 1995, Section 1, Page 22Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Clutching a steak knife and leaning out over the street, the man seemed alternately ready to jump or to cut his own throat, the police said.But when Emergency Medical Service technicians arrived at 4:38 P.M., the man appeared unable to hear them and would not speak. Indeed, he had left a note on the ledge explaining that he was deaf and needed someone who could communicate in sign language, because he \"had a problem,\" said a police spokesman, Detective Julio Martinez.That is when two officers from the 13th Precinct ran to Junior High School 47, the School for the Deaf, and found the two teachers, Dorothy Cohler, 53, who is hearing-impaired, and Joel Goldfarb, 49, who is legally deaf.During the tense hour that followed, Mr. Goldfarb and Ms. Cohler stood on the roof of 257 Park Avenue South, about 30 feet from the man, signing to him as a team of police hostage negotiators looked on. Mr. Goldfarb used sign language and finger spelling to communicate with the man, and Ms. Cohler relayed what the man said to the police.\"We told him we could help him if he came down,\" Mr. Goldfarb said later, as Ms. Cohler interpreted. \"We just kept telling him that.\"The two worked frantically as the light began to fade and it became hard for the man to see Mr. Goldfarb's hands. About 6:20 P.M., as rescue workers inflated air bags on the street, he stepped down.\"It was getting very cold outside, and finally he said, 'I'll throw my knife down,' \" Mr. Goldfarb said.The man, whom the police would not identify, was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center for observation."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/nyregion/neighborhood-report-lower-manhattan-housing-for-deaf-independence-community.html", "headline": "Housing for the Deaf: Independence and Community", "date": "1995-02-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 26, 1995, Section 13, Page 7Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Until last year, she and her family -- her husband, Michael, and sons Terrence, 8, and David, 6 -- lived with her parents on Long Island. She had not returned home because of hard times. She had never left.\"My parents didn't think I could live independently,\" said Mrs. McCall, who is deaf, through an interpeter. \"They didn't want me to move here.\"Mrs. McCall's experience is not unusual among residents in her new building on the Lower East Side, which has 40 rental units for deaf people with low incomes. Many had never left home before moving into the six-story building, with its state-of-the art technology, which offers them a first chance at independence.The building, at 174 Forsyth Street, features several devices for the deaf: a door in the lobby with a light instead of a buzzer, fire alarms and smoke detectors that light up, a video intercom system that allows tenants to see visitors and teletypewriters, known as TTYs, for telephone communication.Opened last March by the New York Society for the Deaf and financed by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, the building offers not only independence but an end to the isolation many residents say they had felt.\"Often they are the only deaf people in their family,\" said David Edleson, the associate executive director of the society. \"We wanted to give them a sense of community.\"Mr. Edleson said he hopes to start a sign language class for police officers from the Fifth Precinct and to get an interpreter for community meetings, such as those held by the Sarah Roosevelt Park Association.There is a big need for housing for the deaf, Mr. Edleson said. The society has proposed building a similar building next door and one on the grounds of Co-op City in the Bronx. It already operates a 135-unit building for elderly deaf people at East 13th Street and Avenue B.Some tenants work, while others receive public assistance, he said. Some are blind or physically disabled as well as deaf. Single people must earn less than $16,700 and families less than $23,850; rent is 30 percent of annual income. Most apartments are occupied by single adults, but there are four two-bedroom units for families.Mrs. McCall's husband, a hospital cook, is deaf, but their children are hearing, like the other eight youngsters in the building. \"Living on my own is a struggle,\" she said, \"especially with two children. But that's life. I'm taking care of my children, and I feel very capable.\" M.W."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/magazine/the-big-city-sign-language.html", "headline": "Sign Language", "date": "1995-01-01T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 1, 1995, Section 6, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Pataki has already taken a bold step to protect public spaces and curb juvenile delinquency. Without making any formal announcements or adding to the budget deficit, he has begun the most impressive anti-graffiti campaign in the history of New York.Traditionally politicians have dealt with the problem of graffiti by throwing money at it. They've hired workers to sandblast it. They've paid sociologists to study the self-esteem of urban youths who desperately try to attract attention and mark their turf by spray-painting their \"tags\" -- their gang colors and their names -- on public property. But until now politicians haven't dealt with a root cause of graffiti: their own bad example.To see where spray-painting gangs get their inspiration, all you have to do is take a drive on the New York Thruway -- or, to be precise, on what most people call the New York Thruway. If you look closely in places, you'll see signs identifying it as the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway. The public has ignored the former Governor's proprietary relationship to the highway, but over the years the signs seem to have provided self-esteem to his Republican followers. They became infuriated four years ago when a rival gang in control of Albany put up new tags in key locations.At the state borders, where it's crucial to mark turf, the Democrats took down the old signs -- \"Welcome to the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway\" -- and put up new ones announcing \"Welcome to the New York Thruway\" and \"Mario M. Cuomo, Governor.\" The new signs also added the name of Peter Tufo, the chairman of the Thruway Authority, who explained that the changes were made \"in the context of improving our tourism signage.\" Unfortunately, he didn't elaborate on why this particular improvement was needed -- he didn't, for instance, reveal how many confused tourists had been pulling off the road to ask gas station attendants, \"Does your state have a governor?\" or \"Could you direct me someplace I could find the name of the Thruway Authority's chairman?\" -- and his explanation only left Albany's irate Republicans determined to avenge their gang's humiliation.As of today they have a chance to put new tags up, but their leader has called off the graffiti war. Pataki has decided not to put his name on the \"Welcome to New York\" signs on the Thruway or the other roads entering the state -- more than 200 of which were adorned with Cuomo's name. In his zeal to cut the budget, Pataki has decided to leave the spaces blank after Cuomo's name is removed. He didn't make a big deal of this change -- the new policy was revealed only in response to a reporter's question -- but we shouldn't let Pataki's modesty blind us to the significance of the act.When a politician shows that he has more maturity than an adolescent with a spray can, this is rare statesmanship. As a symbolic act of restraint, the policy has already had an impact on the bureaucracy in Albany: Peter Tufo has decided to risk the quality of the Thruway's tourism signage by removing his name as well. And there are those -- well, I'm not sure there's anyone except me -- who hope this policy will inspire an even more radical war on graffiti.As long as we're removing politicians' temporary tags from highway signs, why don't we abolish the permanent tags they put on roads and every other kind of public property? Why don't we stop them from naming things for themselves and their friends? Naming a public facility is essentially a payoff using public money, as the leaders of the village of New Square, N.Y., nicely demonstrated last year by naming their new state-financed housing complex Mario Cuomo Plaza. At the dedication ceremony in August, Cuomo's housing director summed up the situation: \"We will not be forgotten by you, and you will not be forgotten by us.\"Of course, there may be times when a politician deserves having something named after himself. In gratitude for the drama that Cuomo provided three years ago, when he kept two planes on hold in Albany as he agonized whether to go register in the New Hampshire Presidential primary, we might want to name an airport waiting lounge for him. But we ought to offer him and all politicians a deal: If you want something named after yourself, you have to die first. We should pass a law, the Eponymy Proscription, forbidding any public facility from being named after a living person -- or better yet, anyone who hasn't been dead for at least 25 years. Give posterity a chance to put accomplishments in perspective.Maybe the next generation will see the logic -- it escapes me -- of naming the Central Park Reservoir after Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis because she liked to jog around it. But will future New Yorkers understand the signs that went up last year on the Tappan Zee Bridge? It was renamed after a man who served as Governor of New York for a year. Despite all that he accomplished during those glorious months in 1974, I suspect that posterity will be baffled by the upstream sequence of political leaders honored at Hudson River crossings: Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Malcolm Wilson. Meanwhile, we're stuck with the bill for the name change. The state spent $6,000 to put up new signs -- and then had to replace them because Wilson's first name was misspelled as \"Malcom.\"We could make one exemption to the law: If you want to pay to build and maintain a public facility, you can have your name on it without having to die. Otherwise, we should recognize that putting a name on something amounts to giving away a public resource. If McDonald's has to pay for a billboard on a highway, why shouldn't Mario Cuomo? If private philanthropists have to donate $10 million to put their names on tiny buildings, why should Brendan T. Byrne get his name on an enormous arena for free?The Byrne Arena in the Meadowlands, whose lobby wall is decorated with a bust of the former New Jersey Governor, is the most appalling bit of official graffiti in the New York area. It was named while he was still in office, in 1980, and soon provoked a major controversy, even moving one politician to verse. The Mayor of Freehold Township, Arthur R. Kondrup, wrote a poem proposing that the arena be renamed for Vince Lombardi, whose name already graced a rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike. One stanza proposed: \"So up with Vince and down with Brendan,/It's time to change the plaques./All honor to a sporting great,/And none to one who sports with tax.\" The possibility of swapping the names, unfortunately, has never been seriously pursued. Given Byrne's shamelessness, it would probably be unfair to pin the name even on a rest stop. But maybe we could find an appropriate spot there for his bust."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/enabling-the-deaf-to-hear-surgery-that-cuts-two-ways.html", "headline": "Enabling the Deaf to Hear: Surgery That Cuts Two Ways", "date": "1994-10-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "WHEN 3-year-old Marisa Mittiga of Manalapan rides in her parents' car, she is visibly startled by music coming from the radio. Her parents, Dominick and Camille, couldn't be more pleased. \"It's a start for someone who is profoundly deaf and has never heard any sounds before,\" Mrs. Mittiga said. Their daughter can now react to such sounds thanks to a an electronic device in her ear known as a cochlear implant. Part of the device is surgically inserted under the skin behind an ear and has a tiny tube that extends about an inch into the inner ear (the cochlea). The device restores a level of auditory sensation in those who are profoundly deaf, and allows many adults, and a few children to recognize speech without lipreading.But the surgery is very expensive and the results vary widely.\"We are giving her a tool to help her,\" Mrs. Mittiga said. \"It's the most advanced technology in existence to enable her to speak. Most parents will do whatever they can to benefit their child.\"Yet the surgery, particularly when performed on young children, has drawn sharp criticism and in some instances, has split the deaf community. The National Association of the Deaf, based in Silver Spring, Md., opposes the surgery in part because it says it deprives the nonhearing person of the deaf culture and language. Some opponents maintain the procedure is dangerous and the results less than expected. Others assert that parents have no right to make such a decision for a minor. In addition, some deaf people candidly acknowledge that those who have the implants might be shunned by other deaf people.In a position paper, the National Association of the Deaf states that, \"the parents who make the decision for cochlear implants are often poorly informed about the deaf community, its rich heritage and promising futures, including communication modes available to deaf people and their families.\"Allan Karp, who is deaf, is president of the association's New Jersey affiliate, which is based in West Trenton and which represents 720,000 people. While he has no problem with adults opting for the surgery, he is adamantly opposed to parents making the decision for their young children.\"It's like we deaf parents deciding to have our hearing children's hearing organs removed so they could be deaf like us,\" Mr. Karp said. \"It is the exact same principle.\"It is important for a child to receive an implant before the age of 5 because it is during this time that children normally develop speech habits, educators say.Dr. Jed A. Kwartler, who performed the state's first cochlear implant in 1993, said a large benefit of the surgery was the safety factor that it added to a child's life. \"A child who is profoundly deaf cannot be let out of sight,\" he said. \"They cannot hear a doorbell or a car horn. The implant allows them to respond to such sounds in their environment that increases their safety value and their interaction in a sound-dominated world. It lets a parent breathe a little easier.\"Unlike a conventional hearing aid, which amplifies sounds, the cochlear implant works by bypassing damaged inner ear structures to send electrical signals directly to the auditory nerves. The 90-minute operation and follow-up rehabilitation costs $25,000 to $40,000.The surgery entails an incision behind the ear under the skin in the hairline and is invisible to the naked eye. The implant stays in the ear and is attached to the skull. Externally, the device has a microphone and a box the size of a deck of cards that codes the sound which extracts composition of speech and sends the signal to the internal part. The box is worn in a harness around the child and the connecting tubes are visible behind the child's ear. The microphone picks up a sound and sends it through the cord to the speech processor, which codes the sound. The sound message is then sent to the inside parts of the ear. The implant decodes the message and passes it along the electrodes. The messages go to the hearing nerve and then to the brain and the person hears sound.Four weeks after the surgery the unit is turned on. The child and parent must then go through what is known as \"mapping\" with an audiologist to attain the correct frequency of channels to elicit hearing. Dr. Kwartler and educators are quick to point out the surgery is not a panacea for deafness. The cochlear implant is only the beginning of a long process that involves an audiologist, a speech therapist and several educators.\"The implant is only a small piece of the picture,\" said Claire Kantor, executive director of the Summit Speech School in New Providence, where 4 of the 90 students have had cochlear implants. \"Much training is needed following the surgery.\"Dr. Kwartler said that during a six-month screening process of candidates for the surgery, parents wee made aware of the time commitment and follow-up involved. \"The realistic expectations are stressed,\" he said. In June 1990, the F.D.A. approved the use of the Nucleus 22 channel implant, an advanced model made in Australia and distributed by the Cochlear Corporation of Englewood, Colo. To date, 106 children in the New Jersey and New York area have received an implant.In a statement regarding the effectiveness of the implants, the Cochlear Corporation said, \"All children implanted to date with the Nucleus 22 channel system obtain useful sound information. All can detect sounds at normal listening levels.\"Yet the degree of success does vary with each child. Dr. Kwartler concurred with studies done by the Indiana University School of Medicine, which indicates that about 10 percent of implanted children become \"stellar\" performers or have an understanding of all that is said to them. Fifty percent will understand 40 to 80 percent of words spoken and 75 percent will understand sentences when their hearing is supplemented by lip reading and physical cues. At the heart of the implant controversy is the use of American Sign Language, which is the first language used by the deaf community. It has its own syntax and is an integral part of the deaf culture. Some deaf people perceive the choice of surgery as an affront to the entire deaf community. \"Children who have cochlear implants will certainly be mocked by their peers,\" Mr. Karp said. \"They will be forced to speak and not use sign language by their parents and audiologists. The deaf community is a very close one. Yet the deaf community will mock these peoples and they will feel left out of the community and certainly suffer as a result.\"Mr. Karp said two of his friends have had implants as adults and they have secretly told him they have lost friends in the deaf community because of the procedure. \"It's as though they have leprosy,\" he said. \"They are now living hermit lives because they try to talk without using A.S.L. and this, quite frankly, turns the deaf community off.\"Laura McKirdy, principal of the Lake View School in the Mountain Lakes public school system, has not witnessed this behavior in any situation among the 11 children implanted with the device who attend the school. The school, which has 185 deaf and hard-of-hearing children from first grade through high school age, teaches sign and spoken language and a communications program that includes English, facial expressions and cued speech. \"No children have been made fun of or treated any differently,\" Dr. McKirdy said.As a member of the deaf community, Richard Herring, the director of the state's division of the deaf and hard of hearing in Trenton, said he personally did not believe there was any sense of being ostracized by those who chose to have the surgery. What educators have observed thus far of children with implants has been positive. \"The biggest change I've seen in our children with these implants is an increase in their speech production,\" Dr. McKirdy said. \"By this I mean the child's ability to reproduce or produce sounds of speech. Other than this they are more auditorily tuned in to the environment.\"Dr. McKirdy said specific examples of their progress included hearing and responding to their names and being alert to sounds not heard before, like a fire alarm.Mrs. Kantor said she has witnessed growth in those students with implants in the area of socialization as well as language acquisition and development. \"We have seen that peer interaction is definitely more focused,\" she said. All of this success takes time. \"There is no great instant miracle with the cochlear implant,\" Dr. McKirdy said. \"It is incorrect to think this is a bionic ear and have great expectations when in reality it is a helpful device when backed up with therapy and work. The reality is that it all takes time.\"While Dr. Kwartler said there had been no major side effects as a result of the surgery, and that it carried the same risk as any other surgery, Mr. Karp said he had friends who have had the implant and now suffer from facial numbness and daily headaches. Advocates and opponents of the cochlear implant agree that any decision should be based on a lot of research. \"We give parents the facts and it is then up to them,\" Mr. Herring said. Parents who seek advice at the Summit Speech School are reminded by Mrs. Kantor that all children must live in the hearing world. \"One of our goals is to provide an option to be in that hearing world if one so chooses, and the cochlear implant is a means to that goal,\" she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/03/nyregion/deaf-boy-4-loses-hand-in-blast-of-firecracker-in-queens-home.html", "headline": "Deaf Boy, 4, Loses Hand in Blast Of Firecracker in Queens Home", "date": "1994-09-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from September 3, 1994, Section 1, Page 23Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

He was in stable condition last night at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan.The hospital's chief resident in hand surgery, Dr. Geoffrey Fenner, said most of Rayangelo's hand had been destroyed. \"There was no semblance of normal hand anatomy,\" he said. At Grandmother's HomeRayangelo was at the home of his grandmother, Doris Figeroa, 1322 Gateway Boulevard, Far Rockaway, when the accident occurred about 9:30 A.M., said a police spokeswoman, Officer Bernadette Rainy.\"The grandmother had just fed him and went to another room when she heard the explosion,\" Officer Rainy said. The boy's uncle, whom the police could not identify, ran downstairs and drove Rayangelo to St. John's Episcopal Hospital nearby. Officers responding to the grandmother's call placed remnants of the boy's fingers in ice and took them to the hospital.An Emergency Services officer, Bill Fischer, who has done volunteer work with the deaf for 12 years, flew with the boy aboard a police helicopter to Bellevue. Because of his injury, and with an intravenous line in his other arm, Rayangelo, who has been deaf since birth, could not communicate. Using sign language, \"I told him to relax, the doctors are going to fix him,\" Officer Fischer said.The news that Rayangelo's hand could not be saved hit hard, he said, \"because of my work with the deaf and also because he's the same size as my 4-year-old son.\" Signing With One HandAdele Agin, director of program services at the Lexington Center for the Deaf in Jackson Heights, Queens, said it was very likely the boy would be able to learn to sign with only one hand. \"It takes a little rearranging, compensating, but he'll certainly be able to communicate,\" Ms. Agin told The Associated Press.Dr. Fenner said Rayangelo would soon enter physical therapy and be fitted with a prosthetic device that should allow him to \"carry on daily functions.\"The police were investigating to determine what type of firecracker caused the injuries, and how it got into the grandmother's house."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/magazine/defiantly-deaf.html", "headline": "Defiantly Deaf", "date": "1994-08-28T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 28, 1994, Section 6, Page 40Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Maybe if I have time I'll get to that later.\"A Deaf woman standing nearby throws in a question for my benefit: \"If you could change being Deaf or being black, which would you do?\" The student looks confused, and is suddenly shy. Her signing gets smaller, as though she doesn't want everyone to see it. \"Both are hard,\" she signs back.Another student intercedes. \"I am black and Deaf and proud and I don't want to be white or hearing or different in any way from who I am.\" Her signs are pretty big and clear. The first student repeats the sign \"proud\" -- her thumb, pointing in, rises up her chest -- and then suddenly they are overcome with giggles and go back to join the picket line.This principle is still new to me, but it has been brewing in the Deaf community for some time: while some deaf people feel cut off from the hearing world, or disabled, for others, being Deaf is a culture and a source of pride. (\"Deaf\" denotes culture, as distinct from \"deaf,\" which is used to describe a pathology.) A steadily increasing number of deaf people have said that they would not choose to be hearing. To them, the word \"cure\" -- indeed the whole notion of deafness as pathology -- is anathema.My guide here is Jackie Roth, one of the protest's organizers -- a Lexington alumna, an actress and an advocate with a practice in cross-cultural sensitivity training for hearing people. Charismatic, self-assured and sharp, she has excellent oral skills and lip-reads well. She speaks and signs simultaneously, which has made her a natural for communicating with the hearing world, and, therefore, an object of suspicion among the Deaf (a position made more difficult by the fact that she has, like many influential Deaf leaders, a hearing spouse). She is unyieldingly ambitious.\"I'm Deaf of Deaf,\" she says. \"I've always said that I'd get to the top and open as many doors as I could for the whole Deaf community. Every deaf child should know he can do anything except hear.\" Since 90 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents, Deaf of Deaf carries a certain exclusivity and prestige: Deaf of Deaf have usually grown up understanding from an early age the issues that other deaf people may not take on until much later in life. \"My father was a dreamer. If he hadn't been deaf, he would have done big things. His family was so ashamed of his being deaf. My mom was a pragmatist, but my father used to say I could do anything. If I said I wanted to be a singer, he never said, 'Deaf girls can't.' He just told me to sing.\"With time, I will learn how unusual such attitudes are. \"When I mentioned a deaf dentist to my deaf mother,\" the superintendent of Lexington, which is located in Jackson Heights, Queens, tells me, \"she said, 'How good a dentist can he be if he's deaf?' \" A powerful sense of self is, for most empowered Deaf, a product of the last 10 years. \"My dad worked his whole life in a factory, printing,\" Jackie says. \"It's one of those traditional deaf trades. The machines are so loud you can't talk anyway; if you're already deaf you won't sue when you lose hearing from the noise. Dad had to settle for that. It was the 40's, about as low a time as there was for being deaf in America. He told me never to settle.\" In Deaf culture, everyone begins with family and school history, then leads back to the topic at hand; it's part of the structure of intimacy I will encounter here. \"Lexington isn't going to settle either,\" says Jackie.An hour after I meet the two proud students, I attend a meeting between the nine-member core committee that organized this protest and the chief executive of the school. Jackie opens. \"We do not accept the process by which a new C.E.O. has been named this week to the Lexington Center for the Deaf,\" she says. \"We would like him to resign, and for a new search process to take place.\" Every detail of the baroquely complex search process is called into question. They want to oust the new chief executive, R. Max Gould, who would oversee the component institutions of the Lexington Center. Most would like to replace him with a Deaf candidate, but whether the new chief executive is Deaf or not, they want him to be approved by the Deaf community.The center's director of public affairs says that the protests will peter out soon, that students just want an excuse to miss classes, but that is not my impression. \"There are no Deaf role models at Lexington,\" Jackie tells members of the press four days later as the marches continue. Her signs, like her voice, are impatient, quick, funny and fluid. \"Few Deaf teachers and even fewer Deaf administrators.\" The protesters -- mostly Lexington students -- watch closely. Some are wearing big placards: \"The Board Can Hear but They Are Deaf to Us\" and \"Board Who Can Hear Don't Listen. Those Who Can't Hear Do Listen.\" Some are wearing \"Deaf Pride\" T-shirts or buttons. Individuals climb a low wall so everyone can see their rallying cheers, and the crowd chants back to them, many hands moving in repeating patterns.The faculty representatives to the core committee -- Maureen Woods, Jeff Bravin and Janie Moran -- are especially vigilant. \"Do you think the protest will work?\" I ask. Maureen's signing is methodical and impressive. \"There is no choice,\" she says. \"It must work.\" Jeff interrupts. \"The pressure has been building, maybe since the school was founded in 1864. Now it's exploding, and nothing can stop it.\"A few days later, at another protest, Jeff and his grandmother chat congenially. \"My father and my grandfather went to Lexington,\" Jeff says. \"I am Deaf of Deaf of Deaf. We're ready to take what should be ours.\" Jeff is 25, a member of the \"rubella bulge.\" In the early 60's, a rubella epidemic resulted in a very high incidence of deaf children, and they have made up most of the leadership of the Deaf Pride movement.Concurrent with these protests, Jackie is giving a performance in the New York Deaf Theater's adaptation of \"The Swan.\" The play describes how a deaf woman of great passion (Jackie) leaves her hearing lover and finds true love with the Swan, who enables her imagination. The lover uses signed English as he speaks; the Swan begins with no language but learns perfect American Sign Language (A.S.L.), the language of the American Deaf, which has its own syntax. Signed English, the use of word signs in English-language word order, is not actually a language at all; cumbersome and slower-paced, it is often used when hearing and deaf people interact. For Jackie's character, love is a liberation from the limitations of hearing culture. As her language, which had suffered the cramp and limitation of her lover's English-oriented signing, opens up into the bodily richness of the Swan's pure A.S.L., she discovers her Deaf self and becomes free.\"I didn't learn real A.S.L. until college,\" says Jackie, \"and what a spreading of the wings it was when it happened! Lexington's tradition of arrogant oralism -- they've got a lot to make up for.\" That Jackie should take so strong a stand against oralism -- a philosophy that the deaf should learn to speak like hearing people -- is striking, since she is an oral \"success story,\" a woman who can carry on a spoken conversation with little apparent difficulty, who could, if she wanted to, pretty much pass for hearing and who is sometimes dismissed by Deaf purists as \"not really Deaf.\" When Lexington was founded as the first great bastion of oralism in America, it was the idealist wish of hearing people to teach the deaf to speak and read lips so they could function in the \"real world\" from which they had been excluded. How that dream went horribly wrong is the grand tragedy against which modern Deaf culture has constructed itself. WORDS, WORDS, WORDSThe story of the Deaf is the history of Deaf education, and is recounted in Harlan Lane's \"When the Mind Hears,\" then analyzed in his \"Mask of Benevolence.\" These are the seminal texts of the Deaf movement. In 16th-century Spain, for example, only those who had given confession were allowed to inherit property or title, so inbred noble families undertook the oral education of their deaf children. But it was more than 200 years before the Abbe de l'Epee pursued a vocation among the poor deaf of Paris, learned their manual language and used it to teach written French, so freeing the deaf from their prison of illiteracy and isolation.In 1815, the Rev. Thomas Gallaudet of Connecticut traveled to the institute founded by de l'Epee in Paris, and persuaded Laurent Clerc, a teacher, to accompany him to America to establish a school in Hartford in 1817. A golden age for the American deaf followed. Clerc's French sign language mixed with indigenous American signs and a dialect used on Martha's Vineyard (where there was much hereditary deafness) to form American Sign Language. Deaf people wrote books, entered public life, achieved. Gallaudet College was founded to provide the highest advanced education to the deaf and is still the world's only Deaf university.In \"Seeing Voices,\" Oliver Sacks suggests that once the deaf were seen to function so broadly, it was natural that they should be asked to speak. Alexander Graham Bell led the oralist movement, which culminated with the dread Congress of Milan in 1880 and an edict to ban the use of sign. The insistence on teaching English only (which prevailed until the 1980's; \"I got my hands rapped if I signed,\" Jackie recalls) served not to raise deaf literacy, but to lower it.Forbidding sign turned children not toward spoken English, but away from language. \"We felt retarded,\" Jackie says. \"Everything depended on one completely boring skill, and we were all bad at it. Some bright kids who didn't have that talent just became dropouts.\" Even those who developed pronunciation lost out. \"History lessons,\" Jackie says. \"We spent two weeks learning to say 'guillotine' and that was what we learned about the French Revolution. Then you go out and say 'guillotine' to someone with your deaf voice, and they haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about -- usually they can't tell what you're trying to pronounce when you say 'Coke' at McDonald's.\"Learning was supposed to happen through lip reading, a remarkably inexact science; most lip movements are associated with more than one sound, and the lip reader must guess and intuit in order to make sense of what is being said. \"Pat, mat, bat,\" Jackie mouthed. \"Now, did I say the same word three times or did I say three different words?\" For someone who already speaks English -- someone deafened postlingually -- the technique can be developed, but for someone with limited English, it is an excruciating endeavor. \"Socially or in secret,\" Jackie says, \"we always signed. No theory could kill our language.\"Though at least 30 percent of deafness is genetic, more than 90 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents. So most deaf children enter families that neither understand nor know their situation. They must identify in their peer group; they are first exposed to Deaf ways in school. When you meet a deaf person, his school is a primary mode of self-identification; it's usually told after his name but before his job. \"Lexington\" and \"Gallaudet\" were among the first signs I learned.The Deaf debates are all language debates. \"When I communicate in A.S.L., my native language,\" M. J. Bienvenu, a political activist, said to me, \"I am living my culture. I don't define myself in terms of 'not hearing' or of 'not' anything else.\" A founder of the Bicultural Center (a sort of Deaf think tank), M. J. is gracious, but also famously terrifying: brilliant, striking-looking and self-possessed, with signing so swift, crisp and perfectly controlled that she seems to be rearranging the air in front of her into a more acceptable shape. Deaf of Deaf, with Deaf sisters, she manifests, like many other activists, a pleasure in American Sign Language that only poets feel for English. \"When our language was acknowledged,\" she says, \"we gained our freedom.\" In her hands \"freedom\" -- clenched hands are crossed before the body, then swing apart and face out -- is like an explosion.The fact that A.S.L. is a full (though not written) language, with a logical internal grammar and the capacity to express anything that can be expressed verbally, eluded scholars until William Stokoe published his ground-breaking \"Sign Language Structure\" in 1960. This became the basis for the Deaf activism of which Lexington's is the most recent example. \"To establish the validity of A.S.L.,\" Stokoe says, \"we had to spend a long time dwelling on how it resembles spoken language. Now that the validity of A.S.L. has been accepted, we can concentrate on what's interesting -- how the life perceptions and experiences of a native A.S.L.-user will differ from the perceptions and experiences of hearing people.\" Or, as M. J. put it, \"There are many things that I can experience for which you have no equivalent.\"Perception of A.S.L. uses the language center of the brain more than the visual-emotion center. Deaf children show no predisposition to spoken language; they respond intuitively to sign, and acquire it exactly as hearing children acquire spoken languages. During the critical period for language acquisition -- at its height between 18 and 36 months, dwindling around 12 years -- the mind can internalize the principles of grammar and signification. This paves the way for human thought. (There is no rich abstraction without words.)Once you have learned one language, you can go on, at any age, to learn more or other languages. Spoken-written language can readily be taught to the deaf as a second language. But to bring up deaf children without sign models is terribly dangerous. Though some remarkable ones acquire English through lip reading and residual hearing with constant attention, more often deaf children without exposure to sign bypass the key age for language acquisition without really acquiring any language at all. Once that happens, they frequently fail to develop full cognitive skills; they may suffer permanently from what has been described as a preventable form of mental retardation.Helen Keller famously observed that being blind cuts people off from things, while being deaf cuts people off from other people. Poor communication skills result in psychosis; the National Institutes of Health had a workshop this June on the link between poor hearing (nonsigners) and violence. Deaf of Deaf learn sign as a first language at home and are often surprised to discover that other systems of communication are used elsewhere. For the deaf children of hearing parents, school is often the place where they first encounter sign. It is not just social or intellectual stimulation that school may provide; when it is the beginning of language, school is the first awakening of the mind. As I slide deeper into Deaf culture by way of the Lexington protests, I see how a language has defined a system of thought -- and I begin to imagine what M. J. may be able to experience that I may not. THE BEST TIME TO BE DEAFOn Monday May 2, the demonstrators go to the Queens Borough President's office. It is a beautiful, sunny day, and the demonstration, though still in deadly earnest, has that air of festivity that clings to anything for which people are skipping work or school. Jackie Roth is holding forth, and so are a variety of distinguished Deaf leaders. And Greg Hlibok, a leader of the Deaf President Now movement, is expected.In March 1988, Gallaudet University, the center of American Deaf culture, announced the appointment of a new president. Students had rallied for the school to have its first Deaf president, but the chairman, remarking that \"the deaf are not yet ready to function in the hearing world,\" announced that a hearing candidate had been selected.In the following week, the Deaf community as a political force came abruptly into its own. The movement that had begun with Stokoe's validation of A.S.L. took its next great leap forward. The Deaf President Now movement made it clear that the Deaf community was able to function at any level it chose. In a week, they closed down the university, won substantial coverage in the media and staged a march on the Capitol with 2,500 supporters. The chairman resigned, and her place was taken by Jeff Bravin's father, Phil Bravin (who is also on the Lexington board). The board immediately named the first Deaf president of Gallaudet, I. King Jordan. Late-deafened in a motorcycle accident at 21, King Jordan is the most unaffectedly bicultural person I have met; against all the predictions of the hearing world, he has proved a remarkable leader while vastly increasing the school's endowment.Deaf President Now is Lexington's inspiration. At the Borough President's office, Hlibok is electrifying. An articulate signer can build up a picture in front of himself, and the iconic content of A.S.L. provides much of its immediacy and power. Like M. J., Hlibok takes over a substantial block of space in front of himself when he signs. He says that the Lexington board members are like adults playing with a doll house, moving deaf students like dolls. He seems to create the house in the air; by the time he has finished, you can see it and the interfering arms of the board reaching into it. It is as if his fingers have left trails of light behind them that hold the pictures he is drawing. His wrists snap sharply with conviction, and his hands open and close as if they might eventually stop in the shape of fists. The students cheer, many of them by raising their hands over their heads and waving them, fingers splayed, in Deaf applause.In the midst of the Lexington fracas, Max Gould, the newly appointed chief executive, resigns. There are waves of astonishment. Gould claims that his appointment has been muddying the real issues facing Lexington. Seizing the air of opportunity, a board member proposes Phil Bravin as board president, and the incumbent withdraws. The Gallaudet scenario has repeated itself. Many Deaf people, when they are very excited, make loud sounds, often at very high or very low pitches, wordless exclamations of delight. In the halls of Lexington, students cheer, almost incredulous that their actions could have been fruitful, and anyone hearing is transfixed by the sound.\"It was a real sense of deja vu,\" Phil Bravin would say to me one afternoon a few months later. \"It was so much like Gallaudet all over again, and it showed that that victory was just the beginning. It was also the best thing that could have happened to those students, no matter how many classes they missed during the protests. You can't learn civil rights from a textbook. Some of them came from families that said, 'You're deaf; don't shoot too high.' Now they know better.\"At Lexington graduation, a week later, Hlibok is the speaker. In the midst of a hackneyed, boring speech, he says, rather casually, \"From the time God made earth until today, this is probably the best time to be Deaf.\" At a victory celebration the next day, Jeff Bravin says, \"We'll be running our own show now.\" Jackie Roth says: \"It's all great. But the battle's not over.\" And indeed, within a month a new saga will begin over the appointment of a principal for J.H.S. 47, New York City's only public school for the deaf; once more, the Deaf will be excluded from the selection process. SAVE THE CHILDREN\"Mainstreaming\" (or \"inclusion\") -- \"the backlash,\" as M. J. Bienvenu calls it -- is making schools ever more the locus of Deaf struggles. The Americans With Disabilities Act, in an attempt to give full educational benefits to people once shunted into second-rate special schools, has recommended that schools be made more fully accessible. Public law 94-142 maintains that everyone who can use ordinary schools should do so. For the deaf, often physically unable to learn the mainstream's means of communication, this is the worst disaster since the Congress of Milan. \"Children from Spanish-speaking homes may learn English at school as a second language,\" says M. J. \"Children from nonsigning homes who are taught only in English at school may never learn language at all.\" The Clinton Administration has not been receptive to calls for separate Deaf schools. \"It is a terrible abuse,\" says Oscar Cohen, Lexington's superintendent. Jackie Roth says, \"It makes me sick with rage.\"\"There are some children who can function well in mainstream schools,\" says Robert Davila, an Assistant Secretary of Education under George Bush and a leader of the Hispanic Deaf community. \"They need help from supportive families, special abilities, good language of some kind and constant individual help from teachers. Many children, even if they overcome the incredible obstacles, will be so lonely there. The Deaf school where I went was my salvation.\"According to the Rowley decision, which upheld a school district's refusal to provide interpreter services to a deaf girl on grounds that she was passing, it is the obligation of the schools into which children are mainstreamed to give \"sufficient\" education rather than to \"maximize\" those students' potential. Their social welfare is not a concern.Once considered the vanguard of Deaf separatism, M. J. Bienvenu's Bicultural Center now focuses on cooperation; it laid the groundwork for the Bi-Bi (bilingual, bicultural) movement in education, which is the Deaf community's answer to mainstreaming and an alternative to the trend in Deaf education for \"total communication.\"\"Total communication\" means speaking and signing at once, and it's difficult to do. Non-A.S.L. signed languages, predicated on oral syntax as they are, are sometimes nearly incomprehensible. And the structures of English and A.S.L. are completely different; you can no more speak English while signing in A.S.L. than you can speak English while writing Chinese. In English, words are used in sequence; A.S.L. often uses words simultaneously, or amalgamates them into composite signs. So in A.S.L., one gesture could mean \"He moved from the East Coast to the West Coast.\" If you sign \"he,\" then \"moved,\" then \"from\" and so on, logic disappears; a visual grammar conveyed sequentially is \"unnatural\" and counterintutitive.In Bi-Bi, children are encouraged to develop sign as a \"natural\" first language; written English is taught as a second language, and many students seem to excel at it, running close to their hearing counterparts. (It should be noted that, on average, deaf high-school graduates have a fourth-grade reading level.) The technique is gaining: Eddy Laird, superintendent of the Indiana School for the Deaf, has been one of the first to institute Bi-Bi on a full scale. It has also been used at the schools on the Gallaudet campus.Spoken English is taught but not emphasized within the Bi-Bi system. The system's successes are astonishing, and yet the lack of spoken language is a real disability. It is striking that many of the most extreme anti-oralists themselves have and use excellent oral skills. \"They're incredibly useful, and anyone who can learn them should,\" Jackie Roth acknowledged. \"I happen to have a skill there, and it's been invaluable for me. But speech can't be taught at the cost of human growth. Balance!\" A 'FAMILY' GATHERINGFresh from Lexington, I go to England to meet leaders of the British Deaf community. Word of the protests has reached them through the Deaf media (a broad range of local and international newspapers, newsletters, special television programs, fax and E-mail), but in Britain there has been no equivalent of Gallaudet's Deaf President Now; the situation I describe seems inconceivable. \"We're 40 years behind,\" says Doug Alker, the only Deaf executive at the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (which the Deaf call Really Not Interested in the Deaf). \"Most deaf people in Britain see themselves as victims.\" Hearing people often make the mistake of assuming that sign is a universal language, but there are almost as many signed as spoken languages. American Sign Language is related to French sign (because of Laurent Clerc), but British sign is extremely different.I also visit the famed Deaf Scottish musician Evelyn Glennie, who can feel the trembling of the separate instruments of an orchestra, can modulate her voice's timbre with real beauty, can even understand words through vibration. Her solo percussion performances astonish. \"If had a deaf child,\" she says, \"I would teach him by holding him against my body all the time, so he could feel the vibrations of my speech. I would lie with his hands on my throat, hold him against my heart, lay him on the piano so he could learn about sound and music from the air. With a hearing child, I'd do the same. Your ears are just one of a multitude of ways of experiencing sound.\"Back in the United States, I attend the biennial National Association of the Deaf convention, which takes place this year in Knoxville, Tenn., with almost 2,000 Deaf participants. At Lexington, I saw Deaf people stand up to the hearing world. I learned how a TTY (a telephone cum typewriter device for the Deaf) works, met pet dogs who understood sign, talked about mainstreaming and oralism and the integrity of visual language. I became accustomed to doorbells that flashed lights instead of ringing. But none of this could have prepared me for the immersion that is the N.A.D. convention, where the brightest, most politicized, most committed Deaf gather for political focus and social exchange. The association has been the center of Deaf self-realization and power since it was founded in 1880. There, it is not a question of whether the hearing will accept the existence of Deaf culture, but of whether Deaf culture will accept the hearing.I arrive the night of the president's reception. There are 1,000 people in the grand ballroom of the Hyatt Regency, the lights turned up because these people are unable to communicate in darkness. The crowd is nearly soundless; you hear the claps that are part of the articulation of A.S.L., the clicks and puffing noises the deaf make when they sign, and occasionally their big uncontrolled laughter. People greet each other as if they have been waiting forever for these encounters -- the Deaf community is close, closed and affectionate.Deaf people touch each other far more than the hearing, and everyone here hugs friends. I see demonstrators I got to know at Lexington and people I talked to only in formal interviews; here at the N.A.D., there are no barriers and boundaries, and I, too, find myself hugging people as if I have known them forever. Yet I must be careful of the difference between a friendly and a forward embrace; how you touch communicates a world of meaning in Deaf circles. I must be careful of looking abstractedly at people signing; they will think I am eavesdropping. I do not know any of the etiquette of these new circumstances. \"Good luck with the culture shock,\" more than one person says to me, and I get many helpful hints.As I look across the room it seems as if some strange human sea is breaking into waves and glinting in the light, as thousands of hands move at stunning speed, describing a spatial grammar with sharply individual voices and accents. The association is host to the Miss Deaf America pageant, and the young beauties, dressed to the nines and sporting their state sashes, are objects of considerable attention. \"Look how beautifully she expresses herself,\" says someone, pointing to one contestant, and then, of another: \"Can you believe that blurry Southern signing? I didn't think anyone really signed like that!\" (Regional variations of sign can be dangerous: the sign that in New York slang means \"cake\" in some Southern states means \"sanitary napkin,\" which led to considerable confusion at mealtimes; my own poor articulation led me to invite someone not to have \"lunch,\" but to have \"a lesbian.\")The luminaries of the Deaf world -- activists, actors, professors -- mix comfortably with the beauty queens. I am one of perhaps a dozen hearing people at this party. I will soon come to understand better how factionalized the Deaf community is. (M. J. Bienvenu and Jackie Roth and Greg Hlibok, for example, do not seem to like each other, though \"all the factions always pull together when necessary,\" M. J. reassures.) I will hear of the crab theory (if one crab is strong enough to climb out of the barrel, the others pull him back down; Deaf people use this metaphor to describe their community all the time), and I will see how petty ideology has split a community that once stood firmly united. Nonetheless, the basic fact of Deaf culture remains. I have heard Deaf people talk about how their \"family\" is the Deaf community. Rejected in so many instances by parents with whom they cannot communicate, united by their struggle with a world that is seldom understanding of them, they have formed inviolable bonds of love of a kind that are rare in hearing culture. At the National Association of the Deaf, they are unmistakable. Disconcerting though it may sound, it is impossible, here, not to wish you were Deaf. I had known that Deaf culture existed, but I had not guessed how heady it is.The association members are a tiny minority, less than 10 percent of the nation's Deaf; most deaf people are what the Deaf call \"grass roots.\" The week after the convention, the national Deaf bowling championships in Baltimore will attract a much larger crowd, people who go to Deaf clubs, play cards and work in blue-collar jobs. Below them in the Deaf status structure are the peddlers (the Deaf word for the mendicants who \"sell\" cards with the manual alphabet on subways -- the established Deaf community tried as early as the 40's to get them off the streets); on Lexington Avenue around 103d Street in New York, some homeless deaf were livingon the roof of a building. \"Those people also,\" says Jackie Roth, \"whatever they have lost, have this connectedness in their own Deaf communities. It comes with the territory, so long as they are not isolated from other Deaf people.\"During the following week, I will do dozens of interviews, struggling to pick up the subtleties of A.S.L. accent that betray so much of the meaning of what people are saying. I will discuss the Deaf travel industry with Aaron Rudner, of Deafstar Travel, who started this business going, and with Joyce Brubaker, of Deaf Joy Travel, who is organizing the first Deaf gay cruise. I will watch videos of eloquent signers telling stories. I will attend seminars on A.S.L. usage, on AIDS, on domestic violence. I will talk to Alan Barwiolek, who founded the New York Deaf Theater, about the difference between plays translated for the Deaf and Deaf plays. I will see Deaf comedians. (Ken Glickman, a.k.a. Professor Glick: \"Deaf and dumb? No, I'm deaf and bright. You must be hearing and dumb or you wouldn't have asked me that. You think I'm hearing-impaired? I think you're deaf-impaired, and I can sell you, cheap, a deafing aid. This ball of cotton wool can help any profoundly hearing person who needs it. Put one in each ear and we'll be making a start. My blind dates are always deaf dates. You ever been on a deaf date? You go out with someone and then you never hear from her again.\") Over dinner, Bernard Bragg will do his lyrical signed translations of William Blake while his pasta gets cold. (Signers can talk with their mouths full, but they can't easily cut up their food and talk at once.)Gary Mowl, head of the A.S.L. department at National Technical Institute of the Deaf, has come to the conference with his children. He often corrects their grammar and usage in A.S.L.. The importance of having a correct language -- \"Gallaudet A.S.L.,\" an answer to standard English -- has only recently been recognized. \"People ask why you need to teach A.S.L. to native signers. Why do English-speaking students study English?\" I think of the sign used by the Deaf gangs of Harlem and the East Village , which is completely incomprehensible to an A.S.L.-user.Late one night, I am watching captioned television with Deaf friends. \"When I was little, before captioning came in,\" one says, \"we used to watch TV as a family. It was great. We would compare notes on what we saw and propose our own versions of the plot. Later, if we saw other Deaf friends who had seen the same show, we would all discuss what we thought had happened. We would construct personalities and events from our guesswork and imaginations; it was practice for the guesswork and humor we need to interpret the world. We laughed so much, and it brought us so close together.\" He stops for a moment, and we both look back at the television with its neatly typed messages. \"Of course having captions on the news is great, but -- this is so boring by comparison to the old days.\"I get into a lot of conversation about interpreters: the shortage of competent interpreters is appalling. There is always competition between CODA (Children of Deaf Adults; refers only to hearing people) professional interpreters and non-CODA ones. The complexities and ambivalences of CODA-Deaf relations, humorously but knowingly conveyed by Lou Ann Walker in \"A Loss for Words,\" are a big part of Deaf culture. (I have the good fortune to work with a CODA named Marie Taccogna, a gifted interpeter who translates both language and culture.) At public meetings, there are often interpreters who are \"doing some kind of a dance,\" says Rob Roth, who is at the National Association of the Deaf to represent AT&T, \"which is lovely as interpretive performance but conveys no information in a language I speak. Hearing people love their picturesque eloquence.\"A New York City court recently refused to get a new interpreter for a plaintiff who couldn't understand the trial as it was interpreted to her. There are lawsuits pending involving Beth Israeland New York University hospitals for failure to provide interpreting services. Early this year, Leah Hager Cohen -- daughter of Oscar Cohen -- published an eloquent book, \"Train Go Sorry,\" which follows the careers of a few students at Lexington, and through a stunningly empathetic examination of their stories and her own creates a brilliant narrative of Deaf culture. One of the most moving passages in that book describes the death of Leah Cohen's grandfather. Oscar tried to stay in the hospital to interpret for his father, but was prevented on grounds that the hospital had an interpreter. The interpreter was in fact off-duty for the weekend, and Oscar's father died without being able to communicate with his doctors, without knowing what was happening to him or where he was going, without being consulted about his own treatments.On Thursday, there is a College Bowl involving Gallaudet, the National Technical Institute of the Deaf and California State University at Northridge. I am impressed by the questions (I cannot answer more than half), and I remember how, 20 years ago, the deaf were generally held to be somewhat retarded. Friday night is Miss Deaf America. For the talent section, two girls do monologues about AIDS. There is some signed poetry, some signed music. The National Deaf Dance Theater, whose members pick up the nuance of music through its vibrations, do a dramatic stage piece, and Bob Daniels, a partly deaf performer, does a dance and sign number to \"With You on My Arm\" from \"La Cage Aux Folles.\" The emcees are Bernard Bragg (who could, tonight, be Bert Parks) and Mary Beth Barber (who was Miss Deaf America in 1980). For the onstage interview, each of the semifinalists is asked how she feels about doctors' attempts to cure the deaf. \"If someone's unhappy with being deaf and he wants to change it, that's up to him,\" says Genie Gertz, Miss Deaf New York, succinctly. \"I wouldn't ever change it. Why would I?\" I am in the cheering section for Genie, the beautiful daughter of Russian Jewish parents who came to this country from Leningrad when she was 8. In an eloquently rendered monologue written for the talent section, she tells the story of her parents' struggle against Communism, and of the freedom everyone found in the United States -- which included, for her, the move from being a social misfit to being Deaf and proud. I have made endless jokes about the Miss Deaf America Contest and yet in reality it's surprisingly moving. It is such a striking idea, such a radical one, that you can be Deaf and glamorous.The V.I.P. party after the gentle, radiant Miss Deaf Maryland has won is back in the grand ballroom at the Hyatt. I am talking to Alec Naiman, whom I first met at Lexington. A world traveler, he was one of the pilots in this year's Deaf fly-in at the Knoxville airport. We are discussing a trip he made to China. \"I met some Deaf Chinese people my first day, and went to stay with them. Deaf people never need hotels; you can always stay with other Deaf people. We spoke different signed languages, but we could make ourselves understood. Though we came from different countries, Deaf culture held us together. By the end of the evening we'd talked about Deaf life in China, and about Chinese politics, and we'd understood each other linguistically and culturally.\" I nod. \"No hearing American could do that in China,\" he says. \"So who's disabled then?\"At 2:30, I still have not left. I remember that one Deaf sociologist is writing a thesis on Deaf goodbyes. Until the 1960's, deaf people had no means of communication except letters, telegrams or personal appearances. If you wanted to organize dinner with a friend, you had to go to his house; you could take two days just inviting people to a party. Saying goodbye was never easy; you would suddenly remember whatever you had forgotten to tell, and, knowing it would be some time before you could make contact again, you would keep saying goodbye, and you would keep on not leaving. \"It's a Deaf party,\" people had said to me of more than one event. \"It'll go on forever.\" And so this evening, it is impossible to tear yourself away. People are even more physical, more flirtatious than usual. Upstairs there is dancing to loud, pulsing music whose beat goes right along the floor and up your legs. No matter how great the noise, you can dance and sign -- the blurring edge between what bodies say to each other as bodies and what they say to each other with words. I finally tear myself away near 4. But I am of the impression that some people will never leave, that the sun will rise and set before that intense, exuberant conversation will draw to a close. FINDING THE CURE, FIGHTING THE CUREHow to reconcile this Deaf experience with the rest of the world? Should it be reconciled at all? M. J. Bienvenu has been one of the most vocal and articulate opponents of the language of disability. \"I am Deaf,\" she says to me in Knoxville, drawing out the sign for \"Deaf,\" the index finger moving from chin to ear, as though she is tracing a broad smile. \"To see myself as Deaf is as much of a choice as it is for me to be a lesbian. I have identified with my culture, taken a public stand, made myself a figure within this community.\" Considerably gentler now than in her extremist heyday in the early 80's, she acknowledges that \"for some deaf people, being deaf is a disability. Those who learn forced English while being denied sign emerge semilingual rather than bilingual, and they are disabled people. But for the rest of us, it is no more a disability than being Japanese would be.\"This is tricky territory. If being deaf is not a disability, then deaf people should not be protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act. It should not be legally required (as it is) that interpeters be provided in hospitals and other public service venues, that a relay operator be available on all telephone exchanges, that all televisions include the chip for caption access. It should not be necessary for the state to provide for separate schools. Deaf people should not be eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance (which they often claim). Those who say that being deaf is not a disability open themselves up to a lot of trouble.FEW WORDS provoke a more passionate response in deaf people than \"cochlear implant.\" Approved in 1985, cochlear implants are the closest thing to a \"cure\" for deafness. A tiny chip is surgically implanted in the inner ear and connected to a magnet just under the skin, which attracts another magnet in a transmitter attached behind the ear. A wire leads from that to a \"speech processor\" you can clip to your belt. The processor converts sound into electrical impulses and sends them to the implant, which conveys them to the brain, where they are processed as sound would be. The result is an approximation of hearing.Supporters say implants allow people to overcome a terrible disability, giving those who would be marginalized access to normal life. Opponents complain, first, of the limitations of the implant itself: that it is dangerous, deforming and ineffectual; that it makes people un-deaf without making them hearing. They object also to the very idea of trying to cure the deaf. Paddy Ladd, a British Deaf scholar, calls implants \"The Final Solution.\" The problem is worsened by the fact that the implants are most effective when put in children at about age 2. (\"Like the Nazis,\" says M. J., \"they seem to enjoy experimenting on little children.\")Decisions about implanting are therefore usually made by parents, most often by hearing parents (though Hearing Health magazine published an anecdote of a 90-year-old deaf mother who tried to browbeat her 70-year-old son into getting implants). This feeds into an ongoing debate about who the \"parents\" of deaf children are -- their biological progenitors or the Deaf community.Cochlear implants are not very dangerous. Surgical complications are unusual, though several surgeons scoffed at the Cochlear Corporation's assertion that the surgery is \"comparable to a tonsillectomy\"; some people have suffered disfiguring facial paralysis that appears to be connected to the surgery. The implant has been around for only about 30 years, but so far they have not caused the complications that have resulted from other placements of foreign material in the body. (Deaf activists talk about the horrors of silicone implants and pacemakers.) The implant interferes with certain diagnostic tests (magnentic resonance imaging, etc.), but the electronic stimulation the implant creates appears to have a positive effect on the nerve tissue that surrounds it. Having a wire coming out of your neck can make you look like an extra from a bad \"Star Trek\" episode, but it is possible to grow hair so the wire is generally hidden. Much National Association of the Deaf propaganda about the danger of implants is alarmist; some of it is positively inaccurate.The question of the effectiveness of the implants is more complicated. Cochlear implants are sometimes very effective, often somewhat effective and sometimes practically useless. A late-deafened adult who \"regained\" his hearing with an implant said it made everyone sound like R2D2 with laryngitis. For late-deafened people, however, implants can be a godsend; the approximation of sound they provide is sufficient for people already functional in spoken language to understand much of what they hear. Lord Ashley, the Member of Parliament who has been one of Britain's most inspired campaigners for civil rights, was deafened 20 years ago and now has implants; he spoke on the phone with apparent ease, and said that he has no trouble speaking to people he knows, one on one, though he might have difficulty with a new voice or with a busy conversation.Prelingual deaf adults who have the implants often find them ineffective or just irritating; whether this is because they are unaccustomed to interpreting sound and would find that difficult even if they were given perfect hearing is unclear. For small children, there have been mixed results. The F.D.A. failed to set language acquisition as one of the criteria for approval. Almost all children with implants have some \"useful\" perception of sound, but the sound they receive is often too garbled for them to interpret it as language, and so some fall into that frightening category of the cognitively retarded who develop no real language. The Cochlear Corporation can provide the statistics to show that many implanted children learn more and better oral language, but \"more and better\" is not really enough, especially if this is to be your sole mode of communication forever.The problem -- in practical terms -- is that parents too often want to believe that the implants make their children hearing, which they do not do. Implants are not a cure; to treat them as a cure is a dire mistake. The children who receive them are often not given any special Deaf education. Dr. Robert Ruben, an ear-nose-and-throat specialist at Montefiore Hosptial in the Bronx, said: \"If I had a deaf child, I would implant one ear, leaving the other free in case cures develop that require an intact inner ear. I would bring up that child bilingually. Parents could phase out sign later on if they wanted, but it should not be abandoned until it becomes clear that the child can develop satisfactory oral language. The worst mistake is for parents to neglect the one most important thing -- that language of any kind, no matter what kind, must somehow be got into the child soon enough.\" There are also miracle stories of children for whom the implant has been peerless, but they are unusual and unpredictable.The implant destroys all residual hearing a child might have. Though accurate hearing tests can be done on infants, it is impossible to determine how well those children might use their residual hearing. Anyone with a hearing loss over 90 decibels is classified as \"profoundly deaf.\" I met people with a 50-decibel hearing loss who could understand me only with interpretation or lip reading; Jackie Roth is categorized as \"profoundly deaf,\" but I could talk to her as I would to a hearing person. \"I don't know,\" she says to me. \"I just get a lot when people speak to me.\" Hearing loss is measured as an average of loss in various registers, so someone with a 100-decibel loss could have good perception for very high frequency sound -- and most sounds operate at many frequencies. Further, detection of sound and discrimination of sound are two separate abilities. Some people can discriminate sound well beyond their ability to detect it. So deciding which children are so deaf that they need implants is not easy, because by the time you can detect discriminatory abilities, it is too late for the implants to be the basis of primary language acquisition.Cochlear implants remind me, more than anything else, of sex-change surgery. Are transsexuals really members of their chosen sex? Well, they look like that other sex, take on the roles of that other sex and so on, but they do not have all those internal workings of the other sex, and cannot create children in the organic fashion of members of the chosen sex. Cochlear implants do not allow you to hear, but rather to do something that looks like hearing. They give you a process that is (sometimes) rich in information and (usually) free of music. They make the hearing world easier, but they do not give you hearing. What they give you has value, so long as you know in advance what that is.While the implant debate rages, doctors are searching for more sophisticated and effective cures for the deaf. There are many kinds of deafness, but most come from the loss of the auditory hair cells in the cochlea. These cells, which receive sound in a form in which it can be conveyed along nerve pathways to the brain, are produced in the first three months of the embryonic period and then incapable of regenerating. Once you lose them, conventional wisdom has always had it, they're gone. In the early 1980's, Jeffrey Corwin, working with sharks in Hawaii, noticed that adult sharks have larger ears than baby sharks -- larger in their number of hair cells. This indicated that it is possible for hair cells to be produced by vertebrates in a postfetal state; and subsequent research demonstrated that fish can produce hair cells throughout life, even to replace hair cells that have been lost. A few years later, Douglas Cotanche discovered that baby chicks whose hair cells were partly destroyed regenerated hair cells; observable lesions of the inner ear simply disappeared. When deafened chicks were tested, it was confirmed that they had recovered hearing.This blew away the notion that hair cells cannot regenerate. In 1992, researchers in Jeffrey Corwin's lab fed retinoic acid to pregnant mice, and the result was that the mice were born with extra hair cells. Building on this, a few scientists began work to see what effect retinoic acid might have on the inner ear of mammals past the usual prenatal stage for developing sensory cells, and in April 1993, a team of researchers working under the supervision of Robert Ruben published an article in Science in which they described their unprecedented success at causing the regrowth of hair cells by treating excised portions of the damaged inner ear of an adolescent rat with retinoic acid and calf serum. It is possible to kill the hair cells of mammals after birth and then get them to regrow.It has not yet been possible to stimulate this growth in a live animal, but, according to Dr. Ruben, successful in vivo work is just around the corner. \"I would hope to see trials in humans by the end of the century,\" he said. If it were possible to cause regrowth of cochlear hair cells in human beings, almost all deafness could be treated. Since most deafness is degenerative (those born deaf have lost the cells in utero; almost no fetus exists that doesn't develop the cells at some stage), the question would be whether the new hair cells would remain alive in the inner ear, or whether they would die off again as their predecessor cells had done. There can be no question, however, that if hair regeneration were possible, there would be treatments for many deaf people. \"From the time God made earth until today, this is probably the best time to be Deaf,\" Greg Hilbok said; and yet this is also the moment when the Deaf population is dwindling as it has never done before. Even now, deafness is defined as a \"low-incidence disability\"; there are 20 million deaf or hard-of-hearing people in the United States, but the profoundly deaf population is only about 2 million. Even without cutting-edge research, the control of childhood diseases is shrinking that population. As it gets better and better to be deaf, it also gets rarer and rarer. MAKING THE IRREGULAR REGULARWhat to say, then, of the cries of genocide, the resistance to the whole idea of curing the deaf? I have heard of a couple who opted for an abortion when they heard that their child was hearing, so strong a view did they hold on the superiority of Deaf ways. But I also met many Deaf individuals who objected to the way that the Deaf leadership (focused around the National Association of the Deaf) has presumed to speak for all the deaf people of America. There were plenty who said that being deaf is of course a disability, and that anything you could do about it would be welcome. They were righteously indignant at the thought of a politically correct group suggesting that their problems weren't problems. I also met people who subscribed to the old deaf self-hatred, who were ashamed and saddened when they gave birth to deaf children, who felt that they had always been second-class people and that they could never be anything more if they were deaf. Their unhappy voices cannot be forgotten; in some ways, it doesn't matter whether M. J. Bienvenu \"cures\" them of their ignorance or Dr. Ruben \"cures\" their ears, but they are out there in numbers and need help from someone.Most hearing people respond to cries of genocide with an arrogant shrug. Of course if you can help deaf people you should help them. Give them hearing. Let them escape from their prison of silence. The triumph at Lexington this year coincided with the Stonewall 25th anniversary celebrations in New York, and one could not help being struck by the parallels. Here were thousands of people converging on New York to celebrate an identity that, 25 years ago, was described not as an identity, but as an illness. Unlike other minority groups, gay men and women are members of a culture that does not include their parents; most are born to parents who would have liked them to be born otherwise. In a procreative society, their condition has been described as a handicap. Twenty-five years ago, before the principle of gay rights had been broadly articulated, few people questioned that it was right and fit to try to cure homosexuality -- a terrible misfortune despite which (rather than because of which) some people managed to function at a high level.Lewis Merkin is an actor and playwright, co-author of a remarkably moving play, \"Language of Love,\" which the New York Deaf Theater will open here in December. It is \"the personal odyssey of a Deaf gay man.\" Born to grass-roots deaf parents in Philadelphia, with very good residual hearing, he grew up between the Deaf and hearing communities. \"I could fit in almost well enough in the hearing community, almost well enough to pass,\" he said. \"When I was about 18, I had to sort of come out of the closet as a Deaf person. I had to admit how much I couldn't hear, and to recognize that I would always speak with an 'accent.' I stopped going to parties and pretending I could follow everything going on. I stopped struggling against something I would never be able to change.\" Within a few years, Merkin had grown fully into a Deaf identity, and he became an actor, appearing in the role of Orin in \"Children of a Lesser God\" on Broadway.He describes the parallel journeys of gay and Deaf identity. \"When I was growing up, I looked around at these grass-roots deaf people, who were marginal, unimportant, not part of society, completely dependent on others, with no education, people who saw themselves as second-rate. And I recoiled. I thought, that's not me, and I felt sick at the thought that I was deaf. It took a long time for me to understand what it meant to be Deaf, what a world was open to me. When I first began to think about being gay, I saw limp-wristed drag queens and guys in leather hanging out on street corners, and again I thought, that's not me, and I hated the idea of being gay. And it was only with time that I came into a real gay identity.\"The Deaf community is riddled with prejudice; deaf people tend to be conservative, and can be very intolerant of minorities or of other handicaps. Deaf parents are no happier about gay offspring than are hearing parents -- though, interestingly, the incidence of gayness within the Deaf community is perhaps 15 percent higher than in the hearing world. There is a kinship between the groups. It has been suggested that as many as 90 percent of hearing-Deaf marriages end in divorce, but the majority of successful Deaf-gay relationships appear to be between Deaf and hearing individuals. \"What we have experienced is so similar,\" M. J. told me. \"If you are deaf, you know almost exactly what it is like to be gay, and vice versa.\"Some opponents of the implants have demanded that young children not be implanted, and have proposed that people choose when they are 18 whether to have the implants or not. But if you are 18 and asked to make a choice, you are choosing not simply between being deaf and being hearing, but between the culture you have known and the culture you have never known. By then it is too late; your experience of the world has been defined by being Deaf, and to give it up is to reject who you have become. It lacks dignity: it is an admission of inadequacy, a discarding of your self.It's hard to have children who are different from you. If gayness could be detected in infancy and easily \"corrected,\" then many parents would happily pay through the ears for the surgery. \"In a world full of childhood cures,\" said Rob Roth, \"I would be neither Deaf nor gay. That doesn't make me feel bad about myself, but I know it's true.\" Many gay men and lesbians would have been glad, at 8 or 10 or 12 or 14, to become \"normal,\" even if, a few years later, they had grown into selves defined by the experience of gayness. Most Deaf children of hearing parents have had periods of rejecting their Deaf identity. Twenty-five years ago, the arguments for curing gayness seemed as unarguable as the arguments for curing the Deaf seem to be now. When and how did the shift from the pathological to the cultural view of gayness take place? How did we get from hormone injections and electroshock to gay soldiers and domestic partnership?It is tempting, in the end, to say there is no such thing as a disability. Equally, one might admit that almost everything is a disability. There are as many arguments for correcting everything as there are for correcting nothing. Perhaps it would be most accurate to say that \"disability\" and \"culture\" are really matters of degree. Being Deaf is a disability and a culture in modern America; so is being gay; so is being black; so is being female; so even, increasingly, is being a straight white male. So is being paraplegic, or having Down syndrome. What is at issue is which things are so \"cultural\" that you wouldn't think of \"curing\" them, and which things are so \"disabling\" that you must \"cure\" them -- and the reality is that for some people each of these experiences is primarily a disability experience while for others it is primarily a cultural one. Some blacks are handicapped by blackness; some who are gay are handicapped by gayness; some paraplegics thrive on the care they receive and would be lost if their mobility were returned. Some deaf people are better off deaf and some would be better off hearing. Some could perhaps be both: \"I would never want to move away from my Deaf identity,\" Jackie Roth said. \"But if I could have full hearing, without complications, I would like to have it.\"There is something eerie and sinister about the image of a world sanitized of irregularity; there is a terrifying point when good works become fascistic control. If therapists who set out to \"cure\" gayness had succeeded, and succeeded fast, there would probably never have been a gay civil rights movement, and we would have lost all the singular contributions to the mainstream that an acknowledged gay culture has provided. The National Association of the Deaf convention demonstrates amply that the Deaf have as much of a culture as anyone. There is a race going on. Running on one team are the doctors who will make the deaf hear. They are humanitarian miracle workers, and they are bringing something very valuable to the many nonhearing individuals who would like to know sound and to speak. On the other team are the exponents of Deaf culture. They are visionary idealists who are trying to preserve a remarkable and seductive community.If Deaf culture can be made as visible, important and proud as gay culture now is before the cure is perfected, then perhaps the accomplishments of the rubella bulge activists will allow for a long history of Deaf culture. Perhaps, like the search for a cure to gayness, the search for a cure for the deaf will be dropped by respectable institutions -- which would be both a bad and a good thing. If the cure comes before the search for it is obviated, then virtually all hearing parents and many grass-roots deaf parents will cure their children, and the tremendous accomplishments that have followed the Gallaudet uprising will be the conclusion rather than the beginning of a story. Then the history recounted in this article will be as poignant and remote as a tale of Babylon. This, too, would be both a bad and a good thing. As genetic engineering progresses, we may be able to cure everything, and how we will decide which good and which bad we prefer will be increasingly important. \"Our situation also bears on yours, on the whole world's,\" M. J. Bienvenu said, her signs almost mockingly urgent. I think she is right. This race may be a good indicator for how we value difference altogether."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/business/technology-a-work-in-progress-sign-language-telephones.html", "headline": "Technology;\nA Work in Progress: Sign Language Telephones", "date": "1994-08-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 21, 1994, Section 3, Page 7Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The joke relies on timing, body language and audience rapport.The difference here is that Dawn, who is 12, is deaf, as are the three schoolmates she is entertaining. What's more, her schoolmates cannot see her directly. They are watching a personal computer screen showing an outlined image of Dawn performing sign language.Dawn and her friends are communicating through a sign language telephone that is being developed at the A. I. duPont Institute, a children's hospital in Wilmington, Del.The system is necessary because sign language requires fluid motion, so much so that deaf people have difficulty understanding the jerky pictures that are transmitted by even the most expensive video phones.\"We look not for the quality of the picture, but for the quality of the movement,\" said Richard A. Foulds, director of the University of Delaware's Applied Science and Engineering Laboratories who heads the development of the project.The sign language telephone operates with computers, not telephones. It is a custom-designed circuit board that fits into an I.B.M.-compatible PC. Users need a video camera or camcorder, which can be plugged into the back of the system. As the camera takes in images of a person performing sign language, the circuit board strips out unimportant information.The only elements retained are the \"luminance valleys,\" which correspond to the edges of a person's fingers, clothing and facial features. The result is a black-and-white outlined drawing of the person. Mr. Foulds said transmitting only the essential elements of an image -- so-called \"edge detection\" -- reduces the number of bits, or pieces of information, in the original image 3,500 times. With a grant of $375,000 from the United States Department of Education and access to the duPont Institute's resources, the staff of Mr. Foulds' laboratory set up operations at the hospital in 1989 to develop communications technology for people with various disabilities.Full-motion movement is vital because the grammar of sign language happens in time and space, unlike that of English, which happens with subjects, verbs and adjectives. And in sign language, a sign does not represent a single word. To discuss a train ride, Dawn runs her fingers down her forearm and motions her head as if she is looking out a window.While the technology of the sign language telephone is not yet commercialized, Mr. Foulds said he planned to transfer the technology to a for-profit company. If the circuit boards were mass produced, he said, they would sell for under $500.Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0Feb. 4, 2022, 1:43 p.m. ETHere\u2019s what you need to know about the January jobs report.Architects at a prominent New York firm drop their unionization bid.Hertz hires a former Goldman Sachs finance chief as its C.E.O.It wasn't until the 1950's that deaf people began communicating over phone lines using adapted teletype machines, called telecommunications devices for the deaf, or T.D.D.'s. But those machines, as well as the closed-caption decoders built into television sets, rely on written English.For a deaf person, learning to read is at least as challenging as it is for a hearing person to learn a second language, says Anita B. Farb, associate director of the National Association of the Deaf in Silver Springs, Md., an advocacy group for the 24 million deaf and hearing-impaired Americans. For people who are born deaf, Ms. Farb said, \"sign language is their native and natural language.\"The potential for the sign language phone to be the next big leap in telecommunications among the deaf has other research laboratories working on the technology. Engineers at British Telecom are developing their own system. And AT& T Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, N.J., has been working on edge-detection technology to enhance communications among hearing people since 1988. Kicha Ganapathy, head of machine-perception research at Bell Labs, said the outlined images add information to conversation.Deaf people tend to agree that there is no substitute for sign language. In formal tests of the sign language telephone at Gallaudet University in Washington, a liberal arts college for the deaf, conversations between 13 pairs of subjects were studied. Of those, 11 pairs \"were able to tease, laugh, argue, discuss business, and sometimes discuss highly personal matters without becoming frustrated,\" the study said.While 55 percent of the participants said they preferred the system to T.D.D.'s, some complained that the sign language telephone had blind spots and produced ghost-like images. Since the test, researchers at the duPont Institute have integrated a T.D.D. into the system.Younger deaf people have taken to the sign language telephone more readily than older ones. At a demonstration at the duPont Institute earlier this month, Dawn and her friends, who are students at the Margaret Sterck School, a school for the deaf in Newark, Del., were chattering away on the system in no time.Dawn's joke about the men on the train, who are also deaf, went over particularly well. The Cuban, Dawn explained, lights a cigar, takes a puff and throws it out the window. We have plenty more where I come from, he signs. Then, the Russian takes a sip from a bottle of vodka and throws the rest out the window. We have plenty more where I come from, he signs. Just then, a conductor walks by and starts speaking to the men, not realizing they are deaf. The American picks up the conductor and throws him out the window. Well, the American signs, we have plenty more where I come from.As the kids laugh, a teacher translates for the hearing bystanders, who do not seem amused. \"You have to understand,\" the teacher says, \"a big part of deaf humor involves making fun of hearing people.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/nyregion/soapbox-in-the-city-of-the-deaf.html", "headline": "SOAPBOX;\nIn the City of the Deaf", "date": "1994-08-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 21, 1994, Section 13, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Only visual pollution intrudes. One can improvise and imagine hearing different visual disturbances: trucks, subways, the mouths of people moving in conversation, children at play, ambulances racing down the street. But all of this can be instantly shut out by closing the eyes. It is a restful quiet, impenetrable, safe. In fact, for all its disadvantages, deafness offers an occasional bonus. The chance to pick up cheap real estate near busy airports, for example. It's no accident that the Lexington School for the Deaf, in Jackson Heights, is located right under an active flight path at La Guardia Airport.New York without a soundtrack can also have a fascinating Alice-in-Wonderland quality, a quality that I, totally deaf, find always stimulating, sometimes harrowing. New Yorkers are in a rush, even when going nowhere. Unless they know you, they seldom have the patience or time to listen carefully to people who may communicate differently.Recently, I made a late-night withdrawal from a midtown automatic teller machine. The money came out, together with a transaction record, but no card. Swallowed whole. My only recourse was to pick up the phone and speak and listen. The phone hung mutely in its cradle, mocking me. Frantically, I accosted a passer-by to help, but she fled, reacting to all the scam warnings the banks pass out. I slept uneasily that night and was first in line at the bank next day to retrieve my card.Traveling about in the city can have its pitfalls. On the subway one must be alert and sensitive to crowd movements that seem out of the ordinary. They can signal a delay in the train schedule, a cancellation, a change in the route. At least twice a month I find myself a hapless prisoner on what I expected was a local train, only to find it metamorphosed into an express and was roaring past my stop. Another mystery I often confront: The train comes in, doors open, nobody gets on. Why?Communication can be even more uncertain in a taxi. So many cabdrivers these days are recent arrivals from foreign countries with only limited English-language skills. Writing down one's destination doesn't always help, for there may be a reading problem as well. The times are legion when I have sat at the edge of my seat, arms hanging inside the driver's compartment, signaling with my finger to go left or right as the journey proceeds.For some reason -- is it a friendly look, alert eyes? -- I am seldom able to take a walk without someone asking directions or the time. Often, a key word like \"Broadway\" will cue me in, and I'll happily share my knowledge. If I'm unsure of the question, however, and the speaker's lips are impossible to understand, I'll cut it short with a shrug and an \"I'm sorry; I don't know.\"The time of day is easy. Most of the time you see a wrist being tapped; the word \"time\" is nearly always easy to lip-read. But there are exceptions. Last summer I was sauntering down Seventh Avenue in short sleeves and -- as I later pieced it together -- someone asked me for the time, only I didn't get a single word. I retreated into my private fortress, a pair of shrugging shoulders and an \"I'm sorry; I don't know,\" all with a very visible watch hugging my wrist.One of these days I'm going to keep a promise I made to myself and start wearing boots at the supermarket. I tend to become engrossed in reading labels for ingredients and food values, with my cart parked squarely in the middle of an aisle, blocking traffic. No amount of \"excuse me's\" gets me moving, and finally, in exasperation, shoppers simply bump into my ankles with their carts and shove me aside. The scars on my ankles attest to their fiery tempers.For all its culinary delights, New York can be a minefield for the deaf diner. The rapid-fire delivery of the specials of the day is best ignored, for it is almost impossible to keep up. One can ask for a written bill of fare with these items listed, but who wants to bother? Once I tried to be a big shot; to impress my deaf dining companion, I ordered pea soup from the spoken list of specials. What came was bean soup, which I loathe. Of course, they look alike on the lips.Speaking of big shots, let's look at the \"yes\" syndrome. Many deaf people (including me at times) prefer to keep their hearing loss a private matter. One pretends to understand everything by nodding, smiling, saying \"yes.\" It's simply a case of convenience, of speeding things along, of getting an encounter over with. But you can get into trouble.At a restaurant, the waiter asked something I couldn't lip-read. I boldly answered, \"Yes.\" When a bottle of Chardonnay arrived for my inspection, I finally got the message -- but I didn't want wine. So I sent it back with a very confused waiter. The \"yes\" syndrome is in bad odor within the growing movement called Deaf Pride. No longer is it thought clever to hide one's deafness and pass as a \"hearie.\" Be yourself, so they say, and if the hearing person cannot make himself understood, that's his problem, not yours.I confess to being a middle-of-the-roader here. An \"Excuse me, I must run\" will do nicely in many cases when confusion arises. But if the nature of the conversation is such that good understanding is vital -- like discussing a braking problem with a car dealer -- then I will insist on paper and pencil if necessary. After all, a runaway car can produce different results than a simple breakdown in casual conversation."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/weekinreview/june-19-25-court-is-deaf-to-singer-s-wail.html", "headline": "June 19-25; Court Is Deaf to Singer's Wail", "date": "1994-06-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 26, 1994, Section 4, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The pop singer lost his bid in a London court last week to be freed from the shackles of a 15-year contract with Sony Music that he said condemned him to \"professional slavery.\"Some slavery. Mr. Michael, who is all of 31, acknowledged that he has made more money than he knows what to do with, and the judge ruled that his contract was similar to those of other superstars. Record sales will determine how much Mr. Michael ultimately earns from Sony. Asked his worth, he scribbled down the amount, allowing only the judge to see it.Mr. Michael, however, has always contended that the case was not about money, but artistic freedom. He wanted to shuck his sultry, bare-chested image so that he and his music would be taken more seriously. Sony, he said, wanted to keep him packaged as a sex symbol, and when he refused, punished him by failing to promote his latest album, \"Listen Without Prejudice, Volume I\" as aggressively as it should have.Poppycock, said Justice Jonathan Parker in a 270-page ruling that had record companies worldwide sighing with relief. There was no evidence that Sony had failed to promote the singer, said Justice Parker, who suggested that the biggest problems were Mr. Michael's manager, Rob Kahane -- whom the judge described as a \"thoroughly unreliable and untrustworthy witness\" -- and, perhaps, Mr. Michael's own ego. The singer owes Sony six albums on a contract that could run until 2003. He has vowed that he will never record for the company again, and is considering an appeal. In the meantime, he is being consoled, if the London tabloids are to be believed, by a new friend and big fan, Princess Diana. RICHARD W.

Usually these people, like the estimated five million other Americans who are deaf, must wait for popular films to come out on closed-caption videocassettes.But with the help of three technologies being tested that day, the deaf viewers were able to sit in the theater and see the movie's dialogue in captions that would not distract people in the audience who could hear. Some of the test participants watched the movie through transparent plastic panels, with the captions reflected onto the panels from a moving-text display at the rear of the theater. Others read the dialogue on small monitors attached to the seatbacks in front of them. A third group wore special video glasses that made the captions appear to float at the bottom of the movie screen.All three technologies still need a lot more rehearsal. Participants complained that the display panels and monitors required too much glancing back and forth between text and screen, while many deemed the video glasses too heavy. But the tests offer hope that the deaf and the seriously hard of hearing may be able to join the movie-going mainstream, staying current with an integral part of American popular culture.\"At work, people will talk about movies they saw over the weekend and I've never been able to join in,\" said Carol Zurek, a 38-year-old test participant from Salem, Mass. \"I can't see the film until months later.\"The Academy Award-winning actress Marlee Matlin, who is deaf, refers to movies as one of the \"last frontiers\" for people with hearing problems. Deaf people don't go to movies \"because they don't want to make fools out of themselves,\" Ms. Matlin said. \"When you're an actress, you should go. But I can't, so I don't go.\"For the movie industry, using captions would be a way to add millions of Americans to the first-run box-office market -- a market expected to set a record this year, with revenue of more than $5 billion in the United States alone.Thus the emphasis on technology giving deaf people access to theaters, technology that will become widespread within the next four years, predicts Larry Goldberg, director of the National Center for Accessible Media.The center, operated by the Boston public television station WGBH with support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, is tackling movie theaters as one of nearly two-dozen projects to provide media access to a wide range of disenfranchised communities. WGBH has a long tradition in this field, having introduced the concept of closed-captioning for television 22 years ago.Movie industry executives say it is too soon to estimate the cost of captioning all films and equipping theaters to play them. It may be too great to be recouped from the tickets sold to the totally deaf, but proponents of the technology note that there are also some 20 million Americans with serious hearing problems -- a big group of consumers to draw upon. And as the baby-boom generation grays, the ranks of the hard of hearing will probably increase.\"We're committed to making the movie experience accessible to people with disabilities,\" said Allen R. Cooper, vice president of technology evaluation and planning for the Motion Picture Association of America. He said that movie studios have closed-captioned thousands of their films on video at their own expense. \"But there's a limit to what we can do alone. This requires the cooperation of the production, distribution and exhibition communities as well.\"Forging such cooperation is a goal of the WGBH center, which is working with the National Association of Theater Owners, the Motion Picture Association of America, the National Film Board of Canada and various movie and technology companies.Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0Feb. 4, 2022, 1:43 p.m. ETHere\u2019s what you need to know about the January jobs report.Architects at a prominent New York firm drop their unionization bid.Hertz hires a former Goldman Sachs finance chief as its C.E.O.CURRENTLY, most movie theater chains will lend their hearing-impaired customers earphones that receive wireless signals from the projection booth to amplify the soundtrack. But people who have used the earphones say this cinematic equivalent of shouting is only marginally effective -- and totally useless, of course, for those who are completely deaf. Thus the interest in closed-caption systems.Don Glisson, WGBH's technology guru on the project, said that the technical challenge is not in the captioning, a skill mastered long ago. The trick, he said, is to display the captions in a way that doesn't distract people who can hear.The devices tested by WGBH here at the headquarters of the General Cinema theater chain were an amalgam of new ideas. But it was clear from the screening that they are merely crude forerunners to an eventual solution. Among other ideas being considered are polarized glasses that would reveal otherwise invisible captions.Mr. Goldberg said that whatever devices eventually are used, they must be cheap enough to be used anywhere in the theater. \"We don't want to ghettoize deaf people,\" he explained.Another big technical challenge is synchronizing the captions with the action, which is much more difficult with 35-millimeter motion-picture film than with magnetic video tape. In WGBH's \"Line of Fire\" test, the captions were synchronized with the film by custom software. The laborious programming required, Mr. Glisson said, would be too costly for mass-market film releases.Movie studios like MCA-Universal, and sound companies like Dolby Laboratories, are at work encoding digital information that could be placed between the sprocket holes of 35-millimeter film. This new \"data channel\" would have enough room to carry not only captions, Mr. Glisson said, but potentially subtitles in up to a dozen languages.Not everyone agrees that WGBH should be so intent on making captions invisible to people who can hear the soundtrack. Many deaf people, including those at the WGBH screening, would prefer English subtitles right on the screen so that special devices would not be necessary.Barbara Montan, co-director of the Tripod School in Burbank, Calif., a school for both deaf students and those who can hear, argues that \"open captioning\" should not be ruled out as an option. \"Why should we caption for foreign audiences and not our own deaf audience?\" she said.The movie industry has an answer, harsh though it may sound. \"Captions?\" said Mr. Cooper of the Motion Picture Association. \"It won't happen. It distracts from the motion picture experience.\" AN AGE OF ICONS TROUBLES THE BLINDWHILE Information Age devices can help the physically impaired lead more mainstream lives, technology's forward march can also pose special problems. Take personal computers. Software systems like Apple's Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows, which use on-screen menus and symbols, have been lauded for improving the look, sound and feel of computers. But for blind people, it's often a case of too much look and too little sound and feel.Blind computer users typically rely on small specialty providers of hardware and software that enable an audio device to read aloud the text on the screen. (Print-outs are in Braille.) But the software written to speak to blind computer users, based as it is on the written word, is often stumped by the proliferating on-screen symbols and icons in today's popular software programs.\"People are going to Windows, and it's a pain, but we have to go along,\" said David Andrews, director of the International Braille and Technology Center for the Blind, in Baltimore, which evaluates technological products for use by the blind.The growing popularity of software using \"graphical user interfaces,\" as the symbol-based systems are known, can present at least temporary setbacks to blind employees. \"My company made a sweeping decision to switch to OS/2,\" an I.B.M. operating system with a graphical user interface, said Curtis Chong, a senior systems programmer for the IDS Financial Corporation in Minneapolis, who is blind. Mr. Chong was a longtime user of Microsoft's MS-DOS software, which uses only typewritten commands. \"I will have to start with a human reader while I learn how to use it,\" Mr. Chong said of OS/2. \"And afterwards, if I bring in some new programs, I might have to ask for a reader to make sure I know how to run them.\"It's not just computers that are causing problems.

A bit uncomfortable selecting mutual funds and stocks himself, he relies heavily on his broker, Stephen Hopson of Merrill Lynch.What sets this investor-client relationship apart from most is how the two communicate: by sign language at Mr. Hopson's office in Manhattan and by telephones equipped with keyboards and digital message displays. Both Mr. Buzzard and Mr. Hopson are deaf.As brokerage firms work to accommodate clients with special needs, some are going even further, believing it is good business to actively solicit groups that have been overlooked. And people with hearing impairments are getting much of the attention, at least in part because they are at a great disadvantage in a service business that relies heavily on phone contact. \"It's a vast untapped market,\" said Christopher Sullivan, manager of Deaf/Hard of Hearing Investor Services at Merrill, noting that 24 million Americans are deaf or hard of hearing.Whatever their investing styles, the deaf often have to break through certain barriers to achieve financial security. They may not know where to turn for financial advice in an easily accessible form, said Louis J. Schwarz, a certified financial planner in Silver Spring, Md.Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Sullivan, both of whom are deaf, communicated with the reporter by reading her lips. The deaf, they said, may avoid brokers and financial planners out of fear of being misunderstood or exploited, and are concerned about a loss of confidentiality if family members or others serve as interpreters.Although many businesses, including brokerage houses and banks, are expanding services partly in response to the Americans with Disability Act, Merrill has a head start.It began its program for the deaf in 1990, and has served about 2,000 clients, said Mr. Sullivan, who became a technical analyst at the firm in 1987. At a seminar last Saturday for the Empire State Association of the Deaf in Hempstead, L.I., Mr. Hopson used sign language to communicate with the audience, while an interpreter repeated his comments orally and written material was flashed on a screen. Merrill's clients can check account balances and obtain other information through teletypewriters, or TTY's, devices for typing and receiving print messages by phone. Calls are routed to 81 financial consultants trained to work with the deaf. \"We applaud the efforts of Merrill Lynch in making their investment services accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing people,\" said Nancy J. Bloch, executive director of the National Association for the Deaf, an advocacy group in Silver Spring.Toll-free TTY numbers are also offered by Dean Witter Reynolds, Fidelity Investments, Paine Webber and Charles Schwab. Most TTY numbers of brokerage firms and mutual funds are listed in a directory published by Telecommunications For the Deaf Inc., a nonprofit group in Silver Spring. The $20 directory is available by calling (301) 589-3786 or TTY, (301) 589-3006.In addition, all public phone companies must offer relay phone services for the deaf as of Monday."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/us/pride-in-a-soundless-world-deaf-oppose-a-hearing-aid.html", "headline": "Pride in a Soundless World: Deaf Oppose a Hearing Aid", "date": "1993-05-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 16, 1993, Section 1, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

From it comes a second, related sign for a deaf person who thinks like a hearing person: the same finger, circling forward in front of the forehead.It is not a compliment.A generation after the language and values of deaf people began to win recognition and respect in the hearing world, things \"hearing\" have acquired a strong stigma at centers of deaf culture. Nowhere is this pride and prejudice more poignant than in the bitter debate over deaf children and a medical device offering them a limited ability to hear. Kindness or Cruelty?For doctors and parents -- about 90 percent of the quarter-million people who were born deaf or became deaf in early childhood have hearing parents -- these recently approved inner-ear implants, known as cochlear implants, offer their children a window on the world of sound. But leading advocates for the deaf say it is brutal to open a child's skull and wind wires through the inner ear, or cochlea, just to rob that child of a birthright of silence.In its formal statement on cochlear implants, the National Association of the Deaf deplores \"invasive surgery on defenseless children, when the long-term physical, emotional and social effects on children from this irreversible procedure -- which will alter the lives of these children -- have not been scientifically established.\" A cartoon in Silent News, a newspaper for the deaf published in Rochester, shows a gleeful doctor and inane parents grinning down at Dr. Frankenstein's monster.\"From the point of view of the deaf person, I can quite agree and sympathize that their culture and their language are as acceptable as anyone else's,\" said Dr. Charles Berlin, an expert on the inner ear and cochlear implants at the Kresge Hearing Research Laboratory at Louisiana State University in New Orleans.\"But nobody can make me say that a pathological cochlea is acceptable and should be allowed to continue to exist as long as I can do something about it,\" he said. \"I am dedicated to curing deafness. That puts me on a collision course with those who are culturally deaf. That is interpreted as genocide of the deaf.\"A spokeswoman for the company that makes the implants, Cochlear Corporation of Englewood, Colo., said 2,630 people in the United States and Canada had received implants since the first trials a decade ago. Usually, the operation costs $25,000 to $35,000.After the incision heals, surgeons wind a wire in the patient's inner ear and place a miniature receiver under the skin behind the ear. The apparatus is completed a month later with a miniature computer that detects sound. The computer, which can be worn on a belt, sends electrical signals to the implanted receiver, which then stimulates the auditory nerve, creating sound. How the sound is interpreted, whether as noise or as words, seems to depend on how young the person was when the implant was received, how long the person has been deaf and whether the recipient knew speech before becoming deaf. Described as Safety AidTo a doctor like Mary Joe Osberger, director of research in the department of Otolaryngology at Indiana University School of Medicine, the implant, in most cases, is a safety aid. \"It allows them to orient to relative events in the environment,\" she said, adding, \"We have compelling data to suggest auditory input improves visual attention.\"To an educator and linguist like Scott Liddell, who is not deaf but has spent a career working among the deaf at Gallaudet University here, the implant is another misguided effort to help deaf children learn a language -- the spoken word -- that will never really be their own.Dr. Liddell, chairman of the university's department of linguistics and interpreting, said the typical deaf child can only acquire \"some English -- and that very late.\"Emphasis on English, he said, comes at the expense of early immersion in the visual pageantry of silent life and language. American Sign Language, he said, \"is the only language deaf children can acquire on a normal schedule.\"In a more general illustration of deaf culture's attitude toward the hearing world, a cartoonist for Silent News, Bruce Hanson, shows a jackboot labeled \"Hearing\" crushing small figures labeled \"Deaf.\" Excluding Parents Who HearOsmond Crosby, a McLean, Va., scientist whose 6-year-old daughter Dorothy Jane is congenitally deaf and whose 3-year-old daughter Carina has a significant hearing loss, angrily brandished the cartoon in a recent interview at his home. \"There's only one place for me in that cartoon,\" he said. \"As an oppressor. That's unfair. That's wrong. That makes me mad.\"Janet Micari, the mother of Jason, a 9-year-old North Virginia boy who is deaf, said in an interview: \"The deaf community has to realize that we are a part of it. You'd better believe I'm a part of it. I consider my child deaf. But I consider him part of my community.\"Jason Micari, deafened by meningitis in infancy, took part in one of the earliest tests of the cochlear implant, before the Food and Drug Administration approved it in June 1990 for use in children. His mother said he was doing well in public school, where he is taking special classes for the deaf. Another early implant patient, Louis Weiss, a 14-year-old deafened by disease, is an honor student at Earle B. Wood Middle School in Rockville, Md. Meeting Half WayTom Willard, editor of \"Silent News,\" stressed the wide variety of viewpoints among those who do not hear about those who do, saying, \"I've got one foot in the deaf world and one foot in the hearing world.\"Hearing parents, he said, can have a place in deaf culture if they \"learn sign language and a basic understanding of deaf culture.\"\"I think it is wrong for a hearing parent to deny a deaf child their cultural identity and force them to be hearing,\" added Mr. Willard, who lost his hearing as a teen-ager. \"Everyone should try and meet in the middle.\"Many hearing parents are immersed in deaf culture. \"I'm the parent of a deaf child,\" said Krista Walker, an assistant to Rosalind Rosen, president of the National Association of the Deaf. \"I've been to conferences on 'who owns the deaf child.' It's natural to want your child to be part of your community. The irony with deaf children is they will be part of another culture. You cannot identify with concept of deafness if you still have hearing.\"Deafness itself eludes precise definition, said Dr. Thomas E. Allen, director of the Gallaudet Center for Assessment and Demographic Studies. \"It's not like blindness, with a nice legal definition,\" he said. Surveys by the National Center for Health Statistics indicate that 21 million Americans have some hearing loss. Extrapolating from the self-reported figures, given in 1990-91, the Government estimates that 450,000 people are deaf in both ears; about 250,000 were born deaf. The Deaf Grow StrongEnrollment in the nation's 60 residential schools for the deaf, which are viewed as important incubators of deaf culture, has been declining, educators at Gallaudet say. The drop reflects the lower birth rates of the late 1970's and early 80's, the successful efforts to control rubella, which can cause deafness in a fetus, and the mainstreaming movement bringing handicapped children into regular classrooms.But American Sign Language has flourished. After the Mark Medoff play and movie \"Children of a Lesser God\" gave the hearing world a sense of the anger that deaf people can feel at their treatment, hearing entertainers and educators reached out.Deaf students at Gallaudet needed no hearing help in 1988. Their protests against having a hearing president were successful, and I. King Jordan became the university's first deaf president since its charter in 1864.But the most important touchstone of deaf culture seems to be the reverence for American Sign Language. With this has come a disdain for other modes used to help the deaf communicate with the hearing -- from \"oralism,\" which includes lip reading and was the dominant teaching tool for generations, to manual representations of English, like signed exact English and cued speech. Cued speech renders English syllabically by using 32 signs, all shown near the face, for most of the phonemes that make up everyday speech.Louis Weiss, the 14-year-old from the Washington suburbs, is among the minority of deaf children relying on cued speech. When he rides the school bus home, says his mother, Judy, other deaf children, using sign language, tease him about his \"dumb\" kind of speech. Ostracism of PeersCheryl Heppner, director of the Northern Virginia Center for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Persons, said: \"I know kids can be cruel. It isn't something that only hearing kids have cornered the market on. It always saddens me to see people who are themselves oppressed can be just as oppressive.\"But, she said, \"if parents choose to raise their children only using cued speech, they are cutting off a great source of information and many, many possibilities for learning.\"And, she added, children whose basic mode of communication is cued speech and those with cochlear implants face ostracism in parts of deaf society. \"I am often mistaken for a hearing person by deaf people who have never met me,\" she said. \"My signs are very English-oriented, and I speak, so they assume I'm hearing. Even after they find out I'm deaf they will regard me with suspicion.\"Mr. Crosby and his wife, Deborah, do not believe a cochlear implant is right for Dorothy Jane, although she hears little more than muffled sound even with powerful hearing aids. They fear damaging her residual hearing. Nor will they consider an implant for Carina, who with conventional aids hears at the edge of the normal range.But the Crosbys are also wary of the militants of deaf culture. When, at a meeting with deaf educators, they heard the plea, \"give us your deaf children\" to be taught in residential schools, Mrs. Crosby responded tartly: \"Fine. Give us all your hearing children.\" The offer, she said, was declined.The Crosbys say they want their children to know deaf culture, and to know English. \"To me it's about choices,\" Mrs. Crosby said. \"If, at 20, Dorothy Jane wants to turn off her voice, that's fine. I want her to have a choice.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/arts/classical-view-no-wonder-strauss-was-deaf-to-debussy.html", "headline": "No Wonder Strauss Was Deaf To Debussy", "date": "1993-04-04T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 4, 1993, Section 2, Page 31Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

He spoke of \"the restraint of this form of art,\" its \"shades and half-tones,\" its \"little touches of color.\" None of it worked.By coincidence, I recently saw \"Pelleas\" at the Seattle Opera, in a new production by Neil Peter Jampolis (with striking sets by Dale Chihuly), just a week after having seen Strauss's \"Ariadne auf Naxos,\" in Elijah Moshinsky's beautiful though slightly busy new production at the Metropolitan Opera. The juxtaposition revealed reasons for Strauss's bafflement. Both \"Pelleas\" and \"Ariadne\" were composed early in the century and heavily influenced by Wagner, and each deals with a mythic subject and rejects realism. Yet they occupy different musical universes, representing opposite poles of the modernist movement.\"Ariadne\" is a deliberate composite of allusions to opera's past. The prologue shows an opera composer and cast preparing for a performance of a new opera seria, only to learn that the rich Viennese patron has hired a commedia dell'arte troupe to perform at the same time. The music derives much of its strength from its miscellaneous styles, which shift as quickly as the farcical goings-on and include mock-Rossini, hints of Viennese coffee-house tunes, standard operatic melodrama. When the Composer sings of the \"mystery of life,\" the music turns to ersatz Wagner, as if to rib the Composer's piety.The score's musical masks, with their winks to the audience, are stripped away when Zerbinetta, the coquettish commedia interloper, sings \"Ein Augenblick\" and when the Composer hails music as a \"holy art.\" In these moments of great sincerity, the music is completely Straussian. Zerbinetta observes that no one can know what is real on a stage; she may appear joyful but really be sad. The Composer defends his belief in music's powers. Both are preoccupied with art's illusion. For one, even when playful, art causes delusion; for the other, in the form of opera, it is revelation.THE LISTENER IS CAUGHT between these two views; the opposition is never resolved. The same thing happens during the work's second half, when the Composer's \"Ariadne\" is performed. Even apart from the commedia interruptions, the opera-within-an-opera presents a peculiarly divided pair of lovers. Ariadne is submerged in a world of illusion, believing Bacchus to be the god of death; Bacchus dwells on his escape from Circe's sorcery, worrying that Ariadne might have similar magical power.Bacchus and Ariadne, with their jarringly mismatched fantasy lives, are as different as Zerbinetta and the Composer, yet Strauss treats their meeting as if they were partaking in a heroic romance. The glorious music makes it seem as if Siegfried were rescuing Brunnhilde, or Tristan and Isolde were finally uniting. Meanwhile, Hugo von Hofmannsthal's libretto makes their love antiheroic, overturning traditions and expectations. The audience is both moved by events and distanced from them, reminded of the past while leaving it behind.\"Pelleas\" is another matter. Debussy also wanted to depart from operatic tradition; he once joked about producing the work in Japan, where there would be no set expectations or interpretive habits. But he does not separate the work from the past by using irony or pastiche or sly reference; he tries to dissolve time completely. Although \"Pelleas\" resembles \"Parsifal\" in this respect, Debussy eliminates Wagner's drive toward resolution and fulfillment. The score uses a motif for each major character and even combines them. But these motifs are not used to italicize events; they seem to float in a musical stream, carried by its currents.Maurice Maeterlinck's play, which forms the basis of the libretto, acts similarly. The characters have no background in time and seem suspended in their mythic kingdom. Melisande has a mysterious past that is never known; Pelleas is always about to leave but never does. Six months pass as easily as a minute. Debussy treats this world of caverns and stagnant pools and deep wells the way he treats the sunken cathedral in his piano prelude: it has its own watery pulse. When Golaud brings Pelleas into the castle vaults, repetitions of a whole-tone scale create an eerie morbidity.Debussy's music actually tries to eliminate all sense of difference and division. It cushions the listener, even dissolving distinctions between sung and spoken language. (Debussy wanted his singers to emulate speech.) Boundaries between the real and the unreal become porous. In contrast, Strauss's music thrives on differences and divisions, on operatic numbers and set pieces, on contrasting styles and sudden juxtapositions. Debussy dissolves history into dream language; Strauss turns history into a burlesque.No wonder Strauss couldn't hear anything in \"Pelleas.\" He was eavesdropping on a parallel universe: similar goals, opposite ideas. We dwell somewhere in between. Perhaps someone should consider performing \"Pelleas\" and \"Ariadne\" simultaneously."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/11/obituaries/tom-cunningham-32-worker-with-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Tom Cunningham, 32, Worker With the Deaf", "date": "1992-12-11T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 11, 1992, Section D, Page 19Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Other children tease her about her hearing aid, mimic her when she uses sign language or parrot her speech.But twice a month Christina retreats from a world where she often feels unwelcome to take part in a program that tries to reduce the isolation of children who are deaf or hard of hearing. The program at the Rhinelander Center gives the children a chance to learn and play with others like themselves in the kind of nurturing atmosphere that may be absent from their homes, schools or neighborhoods.\"It's not like I have to pretend here,\" said 12-year-old Christina, who is hard of hearing. \"I can be myself.\"Last Saturday, Christina and about 50 other children jammed the ground floor of the Rhinelander Center, which is run by the Children's Aid Society, one of seven charities aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.The children, who ranged in age from 5 to 14, spent the day working with computers, drawing and painting, playing games and dancing. Instructors who are deaf and hard of hearing guided them through the activities, thereby serving as mentors and role models as well. Good for Self-EsteemSome children in the program attend schools for the deaf. But most are in special classes at mainstream public schools in New York City, often with only a few other children who are deaf or hard of hearing.\"When they all come together, they can see they have a common language and it's good for their self-esteem,\" said Kimberlee Pelkey, supervisor of the program. \"Here, they're normal, because they have that factor in common.\"The children meet on the first Saturday of each month at the center, at 350 East 88th Street in Manhattan. On the third Saturday they visit attractions like the Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange, N.J., the New York Hall of Science in Queens and the Big Apple Circus. They also see movies, with the help of sign-language interpreters.The program is free and is financed by New York City and The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Since the early years of this century, the fund has given money to charities like the Children's Aid Society so they can brighten the lives of thousands of children and adults.This year's Neediest appeal ends on Feb. 28. All contributions go directly to the charities because The Times pays for the fund's overhead.The four-year-old program at the Rhinelander Center has proved so popular that there is a waiting list for some age groups. So it is not surprising that children like 11-year-old Stephen Hilburn, who is deaf, cannot wait for Saturdays to come.\"It's a wonderful program,\" said Anabella Hilburn, Stephen's mother, who attends a workshop at the center for parents of deaf and hard of hearing children. \"He's so excited to meet his friends that I don't have to wake him up on Saturday mornings.\"Christina, who loves to play dodge ball with Stephen, said the program was filling a void in her life.\"I don't have sisters or brothers, so it's nice to be around other kids,\" she said. \"There are a lot of nice people and activities here.

Not every word they spoke was understandable, but sentences did ring out: \"I making cake.\" \"Look at this!\" \"I'm making balls.\"One girl made only sounds. All but two wore hearing aids. They are enrolled in the only completely auditory-aural program for young hearing-impaired children in New Jersey. No sign language is used at the Summit School.Most of the 90 children at Summit have severe hearing loss, which means they cannot hear speech, unaided, in a one-on-one situation. Using hearing aids, they are taught to maximize their residual hearing and to speak in order \"to take their place in a hearing world,\" said Claire Kantor, the school's executive director. Hearing loss can be identified within the first few days of life, Ms. Kantor said. But it is not usually diagnosed until months go by and suspicious parents prod a reluctant pediatrician for a referral to an audiologist. It is not unusual for Ms. Kantor to receive a frantic call from a parent at an audiologist's office.Ms. Kantor invites parents to \"come and see the program\" at the school. \"The parent must see another deaf child,\" she said. Parents might observe a 21-month-old like Kimberly Lin in a small classroom. Her hearing aids rested neatly behind her ears, and she was learning the word \"more\" as she splashed her hands in a pan of soapy water.Her teacher dipped a large wand with rings at the end into the bubbly water. As she waved the wand, bubbles floated through the air.Kimberly's mother yelled, \"Bubbles, bubbles, pop.\"Learning to Say 'More' When the bubbles disappeared, the teacher loudly asked, \"More?\" Soon, Kimberly would have to say \"more\" to get the teacher to create more bubbles.Some educators of the deaf, parents of deaf children and deaf adults prefer a philosophy of total communication to the exclusively aural-oral method that is used at the Summit School. In a total communication program, signing, listening, speaking, lip reading, reading and writing may all be used to promote communication. Historically, signing has been the natural language of the deaf, and auralism gained momentum only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Alexander Graham Bell's prestige as the inventor of the telephone made him, a speech teacher, a well-known and highly respected spokesman for the aural method. It was not until the 1960's that sign language began to gain respect as a means of communication for deaf people.Today, many of those who identify themselves as deaf contend that deaf children should be taught to sign and that insisting on speech while excluding signing may mean imposing a frustrating, uncomfortable and unnatural behavior on a young person.\"In the aural method, you grow up feeling like your parents are trying to make you something you are not; they want to make you appear to be hearing,\" said Jane Hecker-Cain, a former teacher and now state coordinator of library services for the deaf and hard of hearing.The advocates of signing speak of a deaf culture that is characterized by a shared language, American Sign Language, and a multitude of experiences and behaviors that link deaf people together. A special kind of humor and a singular literature, deaf heroes, deaf performers and deaf artists help define deaf culture. Parents' Reaction When parents learn that their apparently perfect baby is hearing impaired, they grieve, Ms. Kantor said. They have known this child as a typical baby and now have to come to terms with a child with a hearing loss, she said.Ann Buckley, the school's director of development, said: \"The natural reaction of a parent hearing that the child is deaf is to stop talking to the baby, and that's the very worst thing they can do. At that point they need to just pour language into that child. But they need somebody to help them realize that the child must wear his hearing aids or he's not getting any of the language that they're putting into him.\" The speech school's early intervention program consists of two individual 45-minute sessions a week for the parents or primary care giver and the baby, Ms. Kantor said. \"The goal is to make the parents or primary care giver as comfortable and as knowledgeable as possible in working with the child. They are the primary teachers.,\" As time goes by, parents become more comfortable with the hearing aids and with the fact that they have a hearing-impaired child. Sibling involvement is encouraged.\"We do a lot of family counseling with the entire family,\" Ms. Kantor said. The school does not charge parents anything. Partial financing is provided by a state Early Intervention Program grant. The remaining expenses are covered by fund-raising of nearly $250,000 a year.The school's eligibility rules for attendance are the existence of developmental delays in speech and language or hearing impairment from fluctuating to profound.Making Parents Advocates Families come from many areas and some are brought in transportation provided through Medicare or Ambicare. \"Our goal is to make each parent an advocate for her child for the next 21 years,\" Ms. Buckley said. But when the child enters the general school population, \"the mother may have to ask for decoded videotapes, a classroom in a quiet location, not next to the bandroom, and possibly an oral interpreter.\"\"It's a hearing world out there,\" Ms. Buckley said. \"When these children go to the post office or the bank or the library, rarely is there someone who can sign. Bcause it is a hearing world, we want to give them the option of speaking.\"Gertrude S. Galloway, superintendent of the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf in West Trenton, agrees that oral speech education has value, but she feels it is more appropriate after the child has acquired sign language, not before. Ms. Galloway, who has been involved with deaf education for more than 20 years, was a deaf baby of deaf parents.\"I was the product of oral speech education, but I knew sign language before enrolling in the program,\" she said. \"So, learning to speak was not as frustrating for me as it was for other students. Deafness is not a tragedy; the tragedy is denying the person to communicate in his own way. A deaf child is a normal child that can't hear. Ears do not count; it is what is between your ears that counts.\"Backer of Cultural Approach Ms. Galloway advocates a cultural, not a pathological or medical, approach to a deaf child to make him or her feel all right. She does not like terminology like hearing impaired, disability or rehabilitation. \"Deaf are deaf, period,\" she said.Harvey Miller, a lawyer who is a hearing parent of a deaf child, was a founding member of Parents for Deaf Awareness, which is based in Wayne and has 700 members. Mr. Miller's son is now a teen-ager who plays football.Mr. Miller and his wife, Naomi, learned to sign so they could communicate with their son while teaching him to speak. Like other signing families, the Millers can use sign language to communicate across a football field or talk to someone down the block or in the library.For Mr. Miller, the most important aspect of being a parent of a deaf child is reflected in the motto of the Parents for Deaf Awareness organization: \"A deaf child has the right not to be a stranger in his own home.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/26/nyregion/edna-levine-75-a-psychologist-who-founded-programs-for-deaf.html", "headline": "Edna Levine, 75, a Psychologist Who Founded Programs for Deaf", "date": "1992-04-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 26, 1992, Section 1, Page 38Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.She died of a heart ailment, a friend said.Dr. Levine devoted her career to the problems of people with impaired hearing as an advocate, author, teacher, researcher, clinician and trainer of other professionals.She organized the first comprehensive dictionary of sign language in 1964, which standardized the signs. She formed the Deaf Repertory Theater, helped create the Foundation for the Deaf and worked on adapting telephones for the deaf, including experiments with video telephones.As a psychologist, Dr. Levine focused on helping deaf people cope with feelings of social isolation from hearing people. Directed U.N. ProgramShe directed a 1972 United Nations Task Force on Deafness and a 1974 national conference on training psychological workers for the deaf. She initiated the New York State Psychiatric Institute's mental health program for the deaf and founded New York University's research and training center for deafness rehabilitation, a forerunner of centers elsewhere.Among her books were \"Youth in a Soundless World\" (New York University, 1956), \"Psychology of Deafness\" (Columbia University, 1960) and \"Lisa and Her Soundless World\" (Human Sciences, 1974), which was chosen as the children's book of the year by the Child Study Association of America. Her other honors included an honorary doctorate from Gallaudet University, which educates deaf students.She was a past president of the Psychology Commission of the World Federation for the Deaf and a former board member of the American Psychological Association, the American Hearing Society, the Inter-Branch Library Association of New York and the New York League for the Hard of Hearing.Dr. Levine, who was not deaf, was born in New York City and got started in the field after she trained as a teacher at the Lexington School for the Deaf in Manhattan. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate in psychology at New York University, where she later taught educational psychology for 15 years. She also earned a master's in special education at Columbia.Her husband, Dr. Matthew Levine, a psychiatrist, is deceased.

She could not read lips or understand sign language, and it was not clear to her lawyer and the officials at the Montgomery County Court in Rockville, Md., how she could participate in the case.But Mrs. Levinson, of Potomac, Md., said yesterday that the hearings in May had gone \"wonderfully.\" For the first time in Montgomery County, officials acquired a court reporter with special computer equipment that instantaneously translated the proceedings onto a display screen for Mrs. Levinson to read.Although the technology is not new, it has been hard to come by. It has been used in more rudimentary forms since the start of the 1980's. In Mrs. Levinson's case, the court had no such reporter available until a volunteer from another county came forward. A Standardized ToolBut in recent years it has gone from being an exotic feature of futuristic courtrooms to a standardized tool for court reporters, and has been adopted by courtroom reporting schools as part of their curriculums.Like the captioning for the deaf that appears in television programs, the special system involves a 23-key computerized stenotype machine that translates the reporters' stenographic codes into English. Court reporters said someone trained in the latest reporting techniques could capture up to 260 spoken words a minute at an accuracy level of about 98 percent. The words are then be displayed on several screens simultaneously, only seconds after they have left the speaker's mouth.While earlier systems were not mobile, the recent models incorporate the latest lap-tops and portable computers, allowing a court reporter to take it to depositions and a wide variety of places.And the cost of the equipment has dropped by as much as 50 percent, making it more affordable for the average court reporter, who generally buys his or her own equipment. A spokesman for the Stenograph Corporation in Mount Prospect, Ill., a subsidiary of the Quixote Corporation, said the price of a typical system has been reduced to about $15,000 from $30,000 a few years ago.\"The capability is now there for everyone who wants it,\" said Judith Brentano, the president-elect of the National Court Reporters Association. \"We want all court reporters to be trained in this.While it is not known exactly how many court reporters can do this type of stenography, Ms. Brentano said that the services were available in almost every state, and that at least 300 reporters were using it.The system, which is known as \"real-time\" court reporting because the words appear almost at the same time they are spoken, could be introduced into hundreds more courtrooms next year. A new Federal law, the Americans with Disabilities Act, mandates that all government legal proceedings be made accessible to deaf people who participate in trials. Some Prefer Sign LanguageFor deaf people who are fluent in sign language, Ms. Geer said, a sign language interpreter may be a more effective way to communicate, but she added that many people who become deaf later in life are more comfortable reading than signing.Courts sometimes have to pay as much as three times more for real-time reporting, although court reporters said the pay varies with individual reporters.\"Some reporters charge more because it's much more stressful,\" said Merilyn Sanchez, who has been a court reporter in a special computer-equipped courtroom in Phoenix for several years. Ms. Sanchez said her pay was no different than that of other court reporters, but agreed that the work was more stressful.\"You have to create something perfect right away -- you can't clean it up later,\" she said. \"It's kind of like taking a typing test with five people looking over your shoulder.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/21/books/justice-blind-deaf-and-mean.html", "headline": "Justice Blind, Deaf and Mean", "date": "1991-07-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 21, 1991, Section 7, Page 24Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

TEXAS By Randall Dale Adams, William Hoffer and Marilyn Mona Hoffer. 347 pp. New York: A Thomas Dunne Book/St. Martin's Press. $19.95.In Dallas County, Texas, one November night in 1976, fate arranged a deadly introduction. Randall Dale Adams, a 28-year-old drifter and day laborer, ran out of gas and was picked up by a passing motorist in a blue Mercury Comet. The Samaritan was a teen-ager named David Harris. That same evening a Dallas police officer stopped the Comet, which was traveling without headlights, and as he approached the driver's window, someone inside the car pulled a revolver and fired six times, killing him.The exhaustive manhunt that ensued led the Dallas police to Mr. Harris, who \"confessed\" that his companion had been the triggerman. On the strength of the young man's testimony, Randall Adams was condemned to death -- a conviction that was destined to become one of the most celebrated miscarriages of justice in recent history, chronicled first in Errol Morris's 1988 documentary, \"The Thin Blue Line,\" and now by the aggrieved man himself in \"Adams v. Texas.\"I'll warn you right now that this book is the print equivalent of the now infamous videotape showing Los Angeles police officers beating a black motorist. The reader finds himself screaming at the louts who administer justice in Dallas County to please stop beating on this man. Mr. Adams was clearly an innocent hitchhiker. He was not in the car when the murder occurred, having been dropped off at his motel sometime earlier. Although his shaggy appearance made him seem more suspect than the baby-faced David Harris, he had no criminal record; the teen-ager had a history of offenses. On the night of the murder, Mr. Harris was not only carrying a stolen gun but driving a stolen car, and in the days following went on a crime spree of burglary and armed robbery.With such an obvious suspect in hand, why did the District Attorney of Dallas County go after Mr. Adams? The answer seems infuriatingly simple: When a cop dies, the killer must pay with his life. David Harris, as a juvenile, was too young to be executed.Mr. Adams's collaborators, William Hoffer -- who specializes in tales of outrage (he is the co-author of \"Midnight Express\" and \"Not Without My Daughter\") -- and Marilyn Mona Hoffer, document in admirable detail the condemned man's trial, during which a club of good old boys gave him the bum's rush. The prosecutor, Douglas D. (Mad Dog) Mulder, had never lost a criminal case and was not someone who handed over exculpatory evidence with a smile -- if at all. (Mr. Morris, who was given unrestricted access to the District Attorney's files, found a document supporting Mr. Adams's claim of innocence.) Judge Donald J. Metcalfe was a cop buff who wept at a mention of the \"thin blue line\" -- a term Mr. Mulder used to describe the police officers who stand between the citizenry and the legions of destruction. Judge Metcalfe refused to admit evidence concerning Mr. Harris's crime spree, but allowed a highly dubious trio of prosecution witnesses to be introduced so late in the trial that the defense could not impeach their testimony.Mr. Adams might well have been put to death had not a sudden judicial interest in the constitutionality of Texas jury selection focused national attention on his case. The United States Supreme Court finally threw out Mr. Adams's conviction in 1980, and after a last-ditch round of chicanery Dallas County decided not to retry him. By then, however, he had spent 12 years in prison.\"Adams v. Texas\" underscores the scandalously capricious nature of American justice, in which a death row inmate must hope for a hot issue or, better yet, a film maker to plead his case. The problem is, this point was already made by \"The Thin Blue Line,\" whose montage of talking heads and fragmentary re-enactments captured the texture of characters and events so brilliantly that any book published in its wake must necessarily produce insights that go beyond it. Unfortunately, \"Adams v. Texas\" does not. We do not learn much about Mr. Adams's early life or values, I suspect because too close an inspection might make him appear less than saintly. This was a blue-collar guy who admittedly smoked marijuana and watched a couple of pornographic movies with Mr. Harris before going home on that fateful November evening. Yet his voice, informed as it is by the sedate sensibility of his collaborators, comes across as stilted, even prudish.Mr. Adams is also snide about Mr. Morris (with whom he had some disagreement over rights), referring to him as \"the Easter bunny who gathered the eggs of evidence into one basket so that we could present them to the court.\" This seems ungracious, inasmuch as it was the film maker who got Mr. Harris to admit on tape that Mr. Adams was innocent. Mr. Harris, sentenced to death after being convicted for another murder, finally testified in 1988 that Mr. Adams \"knew nothing\" about the murder of the police officer.The Hoffers try to position Randall Adams as Everyman. This nightmare, they seem to say, could happen to you. But that misses the point. What happened to Mr. Adams would probably not happen to me or to anyone else with an expensive attorney and the means to raise hell. It happens to the poor, the confused and the powerless, who can be safely scapegoated. That Mr. Adams prevailed is no credit to the justice system, only to his perseverance and dumb luck. \"Adams v. Texas,\" whatever its limitations, is a well-deserved victory lap."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/05/us/experts-find-deaf-can-hear-at-high-ultrasonic-ranges.html", "headline": "Experts Find Deaf Can Hear At High Ultrasonic Ranges", "date": "1991-07-05T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 5, 1991, Section A, Page 10Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The ultrasonic speech must be conducted by an awkward laboratory device that transmits it through the bones of the skull, but when delivered in this manner even those who are profoundly deaf can comprehend the words.The findings raise the possibility that people may have a second, previously unknown acoustical organ that is distinct from the cochlea of the inner ear, which detects the sounds of everyday life. And they suggest a new approach for designing devices to help those who can hear little or nothing in normal audio ranges.The results of the research were reported today in the journal Science. Deaf Respond to Sound\"Clearly there is a system that will respond to sound even in deaf people whose cochleas have been badly destroyed,\" Dr. Martin L. Lenhardt of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, the main author of the report, said Wednesday in an interview. \"That suggests there is some compensatory mechanism at work.\"But scientists do not know what kinds of deafness might be helped by the new approach.Much remains to be done before any sort of hearing aid based on the new approach will be available, but the researchers hope eventually to have a little patch the size of a quarter that can be taped to the neck to translate normal speech into ultrasonic tones for those who are partly or wholly deaf. The research was financed in part by Hearing Innovations, a company in Tucson, Ariz., that holds patents on the method.Other doctors who have heard about the new results say they are cautiously impressed, but they add that they need far more data to be thoroughly persuaded.\"It's an intriguing idea, but one would have to say this goes very much against the conventional wisdom,\" said Dr. Noel L. Cohen, chairman of the department of otolaryngology at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan and one of the nation's leading authorities in the study of hearing impairments. \"From what appears in the paper, it's difficult to understand exactly what they're claiming their results are. It could be very exciting, a really major breakthrough, but on the other hand it could be pie in the sky.\" Comparative Animal StudiesResearchers have been dabbling since the 1940's with comparative studies of how different animals respond to ultrasonic frequencies. Dogs can hear extremely high-pitched tones, as can many small mammals, reptiles and insects, but humans were thought to be limited to sounds below 20,000 cycles a second. Standard human speech falls between 300 and 3,000 cycles a second.Some experiments indicated that humans could detect tones slightly above the uppermost range if the sound were conveyed so close to the head that the bones were vibrated. But scientists thought such ultrasonic noises would be perceived as nothing more than monotonous squeals and thus could hardly serve to convey information like speech.But while pursuing an effort to help the endangered sea turtle by deterring it from treacherous beaches through the use of ultrasonic alarms, Dr. Lenhardt said he found he could discern considerable modulations and tonal differences in frequencies supposedly way above his hearing capacity, in the range of 30,000 cycles a second and beyond.He said he and his colleagues could hear the ultrasounds by using a device the size of a video-cassette recorder that is attached to the head and vibrates it extremely rapidly. When the head is vibrated at such high frequencies, Dr. Lenhardt said, \"you perceive the vibrations as sound.\"Going further, the researchers tried translating words into these same high frequencies and conducting them through the vibrating device. They found they could easily make out the ultrasonic tones as distinct words 'It Sounded Like Speech'\"What amazed me is that when I first heard it, it sounded like speech,\" Dr. Lenhardt said. \"It was a high-pitched squeaky kind of sound, like old-time voice synthesizer, but we hadn't thought we'd be able to recognize any speech at all.\"The researchers then tested a group of people whose hearing capacity ranged from excellent to non-existent. The people were given a list of six words and were told they would be hearing one of them. The words were closely related phonetically, like socks, rocks and fox.The subjects were told to point to a picture indicating the word they had just heard. Young adults with excellent normal hearing also did well in the ultrasonic, picking the right picture more than 80 percent of the time. Older adults, who had lost much of the upper ranges of their normal hearing -- as commonly happens with age -- did not seem to suffer a similar decrement in their ultrasonic hearing, scoring almost as well as their youthful counterparts.Most encouraging to the researchers was the performance of three people who were profoundly deaf. They picked the proper word 40 to 60 percent of the time.Dr. Lenhardt suggests that an organ in the inner ear, the saccule, may be involved in responding to ultrasound. Although better known for its role in controlling balance and the perception of movement, the saccule, a tiny gel-filled structure, could also act like a high-frequency tuning fork, picking up ultrasound vibrations and transmitting them along the same pathway as signals travel from the cochlea to the brain. Thus, the vibrations from the saccule could, under certain circumstances, end up being perceived by the brain as sound."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/26/nyregion/campus-life-suny-stony-brook-sign-language-foreign-or-merely-an-easy-a.html", "headline": "Campus Life: SUNY, Stony Brook; Sign Language: Foreign Or Merely an Easy A?", "date": "1991-05-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 26, 1991, Section 1, Page 45Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

He also said the course was an \"easy A,\" which had caused its enrollment to \"grow out of all proportion\" while enrollment had dropped sharply in other foreign language courses. 60% Receive A's, Critic SaysProfessor Kerth said more than 60 percent of American Sign Language students received an A. \"This has led some of us to believe that the popularity of sign language has but little to do with the commitment to the hearing-impaired,\" he wrote, \"and a great deal to do with the grading pattern.\"In response to the memo, more than 30 students held a protest earlier this month in front of the administration building and gathered more than 1,000 student signatures urging the university to continue accepting American Sign Language for the foreign language requirement.\"The professor is afraid of losing his job,\" Dane Spirio, a junior English major from Old Bethpage, L.I., and organizer of the protest, said of Professor Kerth. \"He's afraid fewer people will take his class because of sign language's popularity.\"Prof. Roman de la Campa, chairman of the department of comparative literature, called for \"controls\" on the American Sign Language courses. He said he thought sign language should be allowed to fulfill the foreign language requirement, but not in its present form. Instructor's Response\"When you have hundreds of people taking a course, and over 50 percent get A's, there is a question,\" Professor de la Campa said. He added that sign language courses \"should have full-time faculty who have a scholarly investment.\" The courses are currently taught by adjunct professors who are hired course by course.Lou Deutsch, chairwoman of the Hispanic language department, said American Sign Language was not a foreign language and condemned the frequency of high grades in the class.But Mark Aronoff, chairman of the linguistics department, said, \"The internal structure of the words is similar to Latin, Sanskrit, Navajo or Eskimo.\"Lawrence Forestal, a sign language instructor, said Mr. Kerth's information on the number of students who received A's was \"exaggerated.\"Mr. Forestal, who is deaf, urged the the University Senate's Curriculum Committee, which determines student requirements, to allow sign language students and deaf people to address the committee before a decision was made. \"How can the committee set such policies without real knowledge of sign language?\" he asked.Charles Franco, chairman of the Foreign Language Proficiency Committee, said: \"I can see both sides of the argument.\" He said the committee would have a recommendation for the University Senate by the beginning of the fall semester."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/22/us/deaf-babies-use-their-hands-to-babble-researcher-finds.html", "headline": "Deaf Babies Use Their Hands To Babble, Researcher Finds", "date": "1991-03-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 22, 1991, Section A, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The motions seem to be the deaf babies' fledgling attempts to master language, said Dr. Laura Ann Petitto, a psychologist at McGill University in Montreal. She is the principal author of the new report, which is appearing today in the journal Science.The new research strongly suggests that the brain has an innate capacity to learn language in a particular, stepwise fashion, by stringing together units into what eventually become meaningful words, Dr. Petitto said. The brain will progress from one stage to another regardless of whether language is conveyed through speaking, hand-signing or presumably any other method of communication, she added.The results contradict a widespread assumption among linguists that the maturation of the vocal cords affects language development among infants.\"For centuries, people thought that speech is language and language is speech,\" she said. \"There's been a whole complicated notion that the structure of the motor apparatus and the unfolding of the mouth muscles actually influenced the structure and development of language.\"But in showing that deaf babies babble with their hands in a manner that has all the basic elements of vocal babbling, she said: \"We've decoupled language from speech. We've torn them apart.\" Praise for StudyOther researchers in the field of early language development praised the new study as significant and extremely well designed.\"I think this is important work,\" said Dr. Richard P. Meier, an assistant professor of linguistics and psychology at the University of Texas. \"It's been suggested that all children pass through a regular sequence of milestones in speech acquisition, from simple cooing early on, to structured babbling at eight months, to the first word at about 12 months. This work gives us a new dimension of how language matures.\"Dr. Marilyn M. Vihman, who is doing research on language acquisition at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., said the latest results offered further proof that babbling is a crucial step in language deveopment. \"You'll see the emergence of babbling at the same age in any infant who has been exposed to language regardless of other things, including intelligence,\" she said. \"Babies babble regardless of whether the language spoken at home is English, Japanese, French or, it seems, sign language.\" Videotaping InfantsDr. Petitto and her graduate student, Paula F. Marentette, videotaped five infants at ages 10, 12 and 14 months. Two of the infants were deaf children of deaf parents who use American Sign Language to communicate, while the other three were hearing offspring of hearing adults. The researchers analyzed every hand gesture of the infants and compared the two groups.They found that the hearing children made many hand gestures, but that the gestures never became organized or repetitive. By comparison, the deaf babies soon began showing evidence of using about 13 different hand motions over and over again. Nearly all of them were actual elements of American Sign Language: gestures that do not in themselves mean anything, but have the potential to indicate something when pieced together with other gestures.Sign languages are structured much like any spoken language, Dr. Petitto said. Distinct gestures and hand shapes are the equivalent of syllables, and thus must be presented in a series to assume any sense. Reinforcement From ParentsShe believes that the deaf parents noticed the nascent efforts of their children to communicate through signs and began reinforcing the gestures, just as normal parents talk back to and reinforce their babbling infants by turning the babble into words, for example, by saying \"dadadada . . . Daddy.\"But there was idiosyncratic taste at work as well. Just as one hearing baby may prefer to say \"babababa\" while another fastens upon \"gagaga,\" so one of the deaf infants tended to make her gestures in front of her torso, while the other deaf baby performed his hand signs around his head and face.The deaf babies could make noise, but they did not babble vocally like the hearing children.Dr. Petitto said that the new work also supported the theory that the basic rhthym of all languages was the same, building upon a pattern that alternates consonants and vowels. Although the analogy is only approximate in sign language, the deaf babies did alternate between mobile gestures, which are thought to be somewhat vowel-like in their rhythms, and static hand shapes, the rough equivalent of the consonant."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/16/arts/theater-of-the-deaf-names-co-director.html", "headline": "Theater of the Deaf Names Co-Director", "date": "1991-03-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 16, 1991, Section 1, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

One result is last year's Americans With Disabilities Act, aimed at eliminating barriers that prevent deaf and hard-of-hearing people -- among others -- from achieving their potential. The legislation capped a push in recent years by advocates for deaf people, whose message is that deaf people can do anything that others can, except hear, said Thomas F. Colasuonno, headmaster at the New York School for the Deaf in Greenburgh.Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Dr. Colasuonno at the nonprofit day and boarding school, which was founded in 1817.Q. You were not hearing-impaired. How did you get into your field? A. I've always been interested in working with children. When I got out of the service 22 years ago I was working at a post office, when a friend said there might be a job available at St. Joseph's School for the Deaf in the Bronx. So I went there. I had had no previous experience working with deaf people. I did have an uncle who was deaf, but he was deafened later in life, not born deaf. Q. What is the purpose of the New York School for the Deaf? A. Our mission is to serve deaf people here at the school and in the community. We presently serve children from birth to 21 years old. We have just recently started an evening recreation program for deaf people, and I hope in the near future to start an evening college for the deaf with Westchester Community College. Under Federal law, children have an equal right to attend our school or a public school, or both. We are a fully certified high school, offering a full range of curriculum on all subjects. We presently have 180 students, about 35 of whom are in residence. We feel the school is not only an educational facility but a cultural center as well. It is a place where our students get most of their ability to communicate with others, because they are in a like community where they can work with others and get the self-confidence they need, like any human being needs. Q. A couple of years ago students at Gallaudet University in Washington, a college for the deaf, objected to selection of a new president who was not deaf. As someone who is not hearing-impaired, what do you think of that controversy, which ended with the selection of someone who is deaf? A. The problem faced by many schools now is having appropriate constituents as role models, which is certainly a problem in schools for the deaf. We do not have enough people at all levels of employment who are deaf. It is something we are trying to work on very aggressively at this school by, for example, sending out recruiting teams to colleges for the deaf, to attract more people to come to work at our school. The more opportunity our kids get to see appropriate role models, the better the education we can provide. What happened at Gallaudet was pretty much a response to that same phenomenon. Q. Speaking broadly, how does society and current law treat deaf people? A. I think that deaf people have gained a tremendous amount of visibility in recent years, and by gaining visibility they have gained access where they did not have it before. The increasing use of closed-captioned television has been a tremendous boon, as have other technological innovations such as the use of teletypewriters for the deaf. These allow the use of the telephone. Ironically, the telephone was invented by someone who was attempting to help someone who was deaf, but has since been unusable by deaf people. I. King Jordan, who is president of Gallaudet, says that deaf people can do anything except hear. For a very long time stereotypes on television and among people in general have not believed this to be true. That whole premise is one that is being changed now. Deaf people are making inroads where they haven't before. The basic premise now is that deaf people can do it, and how can we accommodate the environment to make sure it happens? Q. How many deaf people and hard-of-hearing people are there in Westchester? A. I can't give you a figure. Easily, there are a few thousand deaf people. One of the statistics that we do have is that the newly deafened elderly are among the fastest-growing group in the county. Certainly we are attempting to address their needs more aggressively. We are working with a group called Self Help for the Hard of Hearing, who have begun to have their meetings at our campus. That is just part of our whole mission of opening up our campus so deaf people can feel there is a place for them to go with questions and for referral services. We also have an audiological center. Q. What specifics in the Americans With Disabilities Act help deaf and hard-of-hearing people?A. The A.D.A. is tremendously helpful. First it stresses the need to accommodate the environment. It also specifically deals with some technologies, giving a national push to them. For example, there is a requirement that there be a national relay system whereby deaf people can use telephone technology. New York State already has such a relay system. It's a service that the telephone company has set up whereby some operators have T.D.D.'s -- Telecommunication Devices for the Deaf, typewriters that you can attach to your phone and receive and send messages. With this service, a deaf person with a T.D.D. can call an operator with a T.D.D. who can then call someone who is not deaf. The operator would read the message and then type the response back to the original caller. There is no national system now.There also is a new law that requires that by 1993 all television sets larger than 13 inches sold in this country must have a computer chip that allows for closed-captioned television. Up until now, anyone who wants to have closed captioning must buy a machine that costs about $250 and attach it to their television to receive these captions, which are electronically transmitted. We're not talking about giving deaf people extraordinary access; we're talking about giving them the same access that everyone else has.Q. Some people might question the expense of some things. For example, should society have to pay for sign-language interpreters so that a deaf person can serve on a jury when it would be less expensive just to excuse that potential juror?A. That person has a constitutional right to serve on a jury and should have that right. Certainly in the area of juries and in many of the professions what has historically happened is it was convenient to think in terms of economic principle. This is no longer allowable, by virtue of the A.D.A. It a simple message but it is so sweeping -- that reasonable accommodation must be made at all times.Q. What more is needed from government or private groups to help the hearing impaired?A. We need to continue to push for people to understand that deaf people are not handicapped because of what they can't do but because of what the environment hasn't done to deal with them. Deaf people can do anything. One of the reasons why a school like ours is so valuable is that deaf people don't feel these barriers at our school.We need to develop with the business community partnerships so they can have a greater understanding of the excellent work potential of deaf people. In Westchester County, year 2000 projections show there will be a tremendous shortage of mid-level and management people. We want the business community to realize that there is a large pool of people that is not adequately being sought now. Q. How helpful to your cause is County Legisltor Paul J. Feiner, with his mini-hearing on the needs of the hearing impaired?A. Paul Feiner has been a tremendous friend to deaf people in general by his direct action and by really listening. He is working, for example, to make sure that when the new terminal building is built at Westchester County Airport that it will be built with the needs of deaf people in mind.Q. How significant is it that a show like \"Sesame Street\" gives a prominent role to a deaf person?A. Again, it cannot be overstated how important it is. It shows that deaf people can be there.Q. The character plays a librarian. Is that really feasible for a deaf person? A. Yes. There are certainly a number of ways. There are computers and typewriters. There are no issues that can't be overcome here. And we at the school for the deaf want to provide a service to the business community by assisting them in complying with the provisions of the A.D.A."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/13/travel/travel-advisory-tour-for-deaf.html", "headline": "Travel Advisory; Tour for Deaf", "date": "1991-01-13T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 13, 1991, Section 5, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Paula Wilson said she hoped knowledge of it would further her career. Justine Berkowicz and her pals use it to tell secrets -- right in front of other friends who have no idea what they are saying.It is American Sign Language, and these are students at Woodlands High School who have normal hearing but are taking the course through the Foreign Language Department. Traditionally, students are required to take three years of French, Spanish or Italian; this requirement still holds, but for the first time, American Sign Language has been added to the department as an elective. Eighteen students from ninth through 12th grade are studying it.Learning Is Similar  \"The acquisition process -- the process of learning a language -- is similar whether it is a foreign language or American Sign Language,\" said Kathy Mason, supervisor of foreign languages and English as a second language at Woodlands. \"There are, of course, differences, too. You learn French, for example, by listening, and listening and repeating. You learn sign language by seeing, and seeing and repeating.\"The course, Mrs. Mason added, represents \"an important\" extension of an already-established relationship between Woodlands and the New York School for the Deaf, which is a few miles away on Knollwood Road. The School for the Deaf was founded in 1817 and moved to its current site, known as Fanwood, in 1938. In 1987, \"after three years of planning,\" John MacLean, an English teacher at Woodlands, began a drama project at the School for the Deaf, Mrs. Mason recalled. He directed a production of Thornton Wilder's \"Our Town,\" using deaf and hearing-impaired students and those whose hearing was normal.Characters and 'Buddies'  \"Each character spoke lines, and each character was also signed,\" Mrs. Mason recalled. \"There was a sort of buddy system for each character, with a deaf or hearing-impaired person and one with normal hearing playing one role. It was a wonderful collaboration.\"Some students from the New York School for the Deaf also began taking English and science courses at Woodlands through an interpreter. At about the same time, Mrs. Mason said, one of the students brought in a course calendar from a high school in Newton, Mass., which offered sign language through the foreign language department. Faculty members, administrators and students from Woodlands and the school for the deaf began discussing the possibility of offering a similar course at Woodlands. Finally, after many planning sessions and discussion groups, the course was offered for the first time this year, as an elective. How the Process Works  The yearlong course is taught daily in 45-minute sessions by John Cleary, a language and math and physical education teacher from the School for the Deaf. The 51-year-old Mr. Cleary, who has been deaf since he was 6 months old, has some speaking ability and uses a combination of sign language and speech to get his points across. The pupils, he said, are generally receptive and respectful, although during the first class in September, he saw that they were doing a lot of talking among each other. \"But my deaf students do the same thing, in sign language, in their classes,\" he said. American Sign Language, Mr. Cleary explained, had it origins in France in the early 1800's by a man named Laurent Clerc. In the 1860's, Gallaudet College for the Deaf inWashington began teaching it. Although there have been some changes in the language, he said, it remains basically the same. There is an alphabet in which different hand positions and motions signify individual letters, and there are thousands of signs that signify whole words. People who use American Sign Language use these combinations, often accompanied by emphatic movements and facial expressions. The novice must guard against using gestures that are extraneous and impromptu and therefore do not denote anything specific. Singing and Signing  The origins of some of the signs, Mr. Cleary added, is interesting: Things relating to men and boys often involve touching the forehead; female references frequently include the area just under the neck. This is because when the language was invented, men wore top hats and women wore bonnets that tied under the chin, near the chest. To teach American Sign Language, Mr. Cleary provides lists of vocabulary words, illustrates the signs and tells the students they must watch, memorize and practice. He begins with the alphabet and progresses to whole words, recounting anecdotes from real life -- involving a malfunctioning car with a high repair bill, an important basketball game -- to make lessons amusing and relevant. Recently, the class learned \"White Christmas\" in sign language, and they sang and signed simultaneously at the school's winter concert. The course fits in well with the foreign language program, Mrs. Mason said, because it requires similar mental processes to learning any foreign language. \"Your mind is like a blank tape -- you've got to fill it with enough exposure to the language so you can pull through the tape and retrieve what you need,\" she said. \"When we learn Spanish or French, we learn to communicate, we don't just learn grammar here at Woodlands. It's a living language. The same is true for American Sign Language. There are differences, but the goal, realistic communication, is the same.\" Easier Than Learning Spanish  Ms. Kelley said she had enjoyed learning sign language because it helped her relate to a 21-year-old male student from the School for the Deaf with whom she became friendly last year. \"A bunch of us would go out to sporting events, which was O.K., because he could see the action. But in restaurants, it was difficult, when we really wanted to talk, when we really wanted to be able to communicate. Learning sign language has helped me so much.\" Also, Ms. Wilson said, she has \"been having trouble with one ear and it scares me.\" She added: \"Sometimes I can't hear anything with that ear, and I get earaches. Sometimes I find myself hearing my friends completely wrong.\" She added that she also understood that some interpreting jobs pay $50 an hour to people with knowledge of sign language, and she said this would improve her chances in the job market. Becoming proficient in American Sign Language, Ms. Wilson and Ms. Kelley agreed, was easier than learning Spanish or French because the syntax and vocabulary are the same as in spoken English. On the light side, the students have enjoyed signing to each other down the hall instead of shouting, and having secretive signed conversations in front of friends who didn't have the foggiest notion of what was being said. In a more serious vein, they agreed, learning sign language has been a unifying experience for the entire class. \"You would think the kids would take advantage of Mr. Cleary because he's deaf,\" Ms. Kelley said. \"You could sit and talk to the kid next to you, like some people did on the first day. But nobody does that anymore. We all respect Mr. Cleary and we respect each other. The class is very diverse, but we are all very, very close.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/23/nyregion/new-jersey-q-a-gertrude-s-galloway-deaf-school-head-is-like-her-students.html", "headline": "Deaf-School Head Is Like Her Students", "date": "1990-12-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "WHEN Gertrude S. Galloway assumes the superintendency of the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf on Jan. 2, she will become the first deaf woman in the country to head a school for the hearing impaired. The 107-year-old school here provides academic and vocational training for 275 students from 119 school districts.In recent years, deaf students and lobbyists across the country have been increasing pressure for deaf superintendents at schools for the hearing impaired. Ms. Galloway, 60 years old, comes to her $69,000 post from the Maryland School for the Deaf, where she was assistant principal of the Columbia campus.A graduate of Gallaudet University in Washington, the only liberal arts college in the world for deaf people, she is a former president of the National Association of the Deaf and currently serves as chairwoman of the National Commission on Equal Education for Deaf Children.Deaf since birth, Ms. Galloway used an interpreter.Q. Should a hearing impairment be a prerequisite for leaders of schools for the deaf?A. Not really. Theoretically it would be nice to have a hearing-impaired leader as a role model. In the past it was not possible because we did not have many trained hearing-impaired leaders, but nowadays we do. But as for a prerequisite, I'm uncomfortable about that because there are many good hearing leaders.Q. Why are women so underrepresented in leadership positions for the hearing impaired?A. We started the women's movement about 15 years ago, which was much later than hearing women did. There were very few women leaders. For example, I didn't have a mentor. There was no one to follow, so I became what you call a pioneer. Gallaudet played a large role in the women's movement, providing training and workshops for women so they could understand their roles in this competitive world. So things are really beginning to move now.Q. What are your objectives for Katzenbach, both short term and long term?A. Short term is to familiarize myself with the school. It's a very big campus with 116 acres. I have to know my way around here, get to know the people and let children know me. I will encourage people to sign all the time in the presence of hearing-impaired children for the same reason that hearing children in public schools can overhear the teachers talking -- so that they can feel part of the school.Long term, I'd like to strengthen vocational programs. The school is known for its fantastic vocational program, and I see an increasing need for good vocational programs so that students can leave here with skills to get a job. I'd also like to expand our local parent-infant program to a statewide level. The third thing I'd like us to become is a resource center. We have a wealth of resources here -- qualified teachers, speech teachers, psychologists who can be of help to other programs for the hearing impaired in New Jersey.Q. Do you have any plans to change the way students are taught to communicate?A. I feel that American Sign Language is the primary language of deaf children in that we should focus on teaching English through A.S.L. That's a new concept. In the past, it has not been practiced because there was no curriculum or information on how to teach English through A.S.L. It's more like a bilingual program. Only recently have we recognized that deaf people are always bilingual because we really talk two different languages.Right now I'm speaking English to you, but actually if I used American Sign Language only it would be a little different language. In the past, we have tried to teach English through the normal ways hearing children learn. We don't know if it's really appropriate. We have a lot of research on teaching English to deaf children, but we have not agreed upon a final solution. A.S.L. is a possibility.Q. What kind of impact is the current state budget crisis having on your school?A. I'm not really familiar with the situation, but I just met with our principals and got the feeling the school is going through the same teacher freezes and the like that are happening to other schools.Q. Are you allowed to raise money privately for the school?A. Yes. I've discussed that possibility with my boss, Dr. Win Tillery, the director of the Division of Direct Services in the Department of Education. I also see the possibility of Federal grants. I have already been talking with people about ideas on how to get grants from the Federal Government to strengthen the program here.Q. Does your hearing impairment put you at any kind of disadvantage in terms of fund raising or lobbying?A. I don't think it will be a disadvantage because right now, people are very interested in deafness. It's different from many years ago. For example, when it was announced that I would be superintendent of the school, I got a call from a television station in California which is interested in doing a one-hour show on me and deaf people. So I think there is a new interest nationwide, and I don't think it will be a problem.Q. In recent years we've seen new laws prohibiting discrimination in housing and employment against the handicapped. How effective have these laws been in protecting the hearing impaired?A. I think the laws are great. However, I personally have some concerns about some regulations that interpret the laws, especially P. L. 94-142, which says that every handicapped child is entitled to a free, appropriate education. I agree with that concept. But the regulation interpreting that law varies from state to state so that some states are misinterpreting the law to mean that all handicapped children have to be mainstreamed. That's not the intent of the law.As a chair of a national committee who tried to see consistent interpretations of the regulations so that all deaf children get a fair, appropriate placement, I'm concerned about that. We should aim for the best placement for the child. For some children, a residential placement might be the best placement, while for other children, mainstreaming might be good. It really depends on family support, the abilities of the deaf child and other things like that.Personally, I feel that a residential school has a lot to offer. My concern with private programs is that the deaf child may be isolated and there may be no peers to interact with. The phrase \"critical mass\" is commonly used by psychologists who feel that children can develop better self-esteem when they are in a large group they can identify with. For example, if you put a white student in an all-black school, it will not help his or her self-esteem. It's also true with a hearing-impaired child.Q. You graduated from Gallaudet in 1951. Is the future brighter for deaf students today?A. Oh yes, far more than in my time. When I graduated from high school at 15, I couldn't find a job, so I went to Gallaudet to find a man. I found a man, but I didn't keep him very long. What made me determined to show the world was the divorce itself, which was a very, very devastating experience for me. I was brought up to marry and have a family, just like my mother. When the divorce happened, I was really devastated. But I was in a crowd of good people, and I had three children who gave me a lot of reasons to make it in the world.When I was 15, many people didn't know about deafness. They were afraid of us. When they looked at us signing with no sound coming out of us, they thought we were crazy. But now it's not that way. They are more sophisticated and understand deafness. So the students nowadays are very, very lucky.Q. Do you wish you could hear?A. I'd like to give you two separate answers if I may. If I find myself stuck in an elevator with a phone as the only way of communication with the world, sure, I wish I could hear. But generally, no. I like me. I think I'm doing fine. The reason I'm deaf is because my parents were deaf and it was hereditary. In order to be hearing, I would have to have another set of parents. How do I know that they would do as good a job as my deaf parents did?"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/22/us/verdict-is-upheld-in-deaf-man-s-case.html", "headline": "VERDICT IS UPHELD IN DEAF MAN'S CASE", "date": "1990-12-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 22, 1990, Section 1, Page 10Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

At the Pierce County sheriff's office he used a telecommunications device for the deaf to ask Catherine Teeters, a deaf woman with whom he was living, for a ride home.In the call, Ms. Teeters made him promise that he would not hurt her or her two children. \"I am scared to death that you will make us die in a car accident,\" she said. Key Evidence at TrialThe deputy, following a Sheriff's Department policy that makes printouts of such calls department property, pried the printout from Mr. Rewolinski's hand before he left the office. Three hours later, in a domestic dispute, Mr. Rewolinski strangled Ms. Teeters. And the printout of the call helped persuade a jury that Mr. Rewolinski was guilty of murder, rather than the lesser charge of manslaughter, at his trial in November 1987.Mr. Rewolinski's lawyer, Brady Williamson, said the warrantless seizure of the printout was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.But Justice Donald Steinmetz, in writing the State Supreme Court's majority decision, said nobody can legally expect privacy when using police phones because the police routinely record all calls.And there was no reason to make any exception for Mr. Rewolinski, Justice Steinmetz said, even though there were no public phones at the sheriff's office that could be used by the deaf.\"While it is true that, due to his and Ms. Teeters's inability to hear or speak, Mr. Rewolinski could not use an ordinary public telephone to communicate with Ms. Teeters, options other than an extended conversation with Ms. Teeters were at his disposal,\" Justice Steinmetz wrote. Opinion Termed InsensitiveIn a dissenting opinion, Justice William Bablitch said that reasoning was insensitive to the needs of the deaf.\"It is only because Mr. Rewolinski is deaf and could not make a call without using a government phone that a record of this call exists,\" Justice Bablitch wrote. \"To say that Mr. Rewolinski 'assumed the risk' of having his conversation monitored when he had no reasonable alternatives ignores reality.\"Chief Justice Nathan Heffernan agreed with Justice Bablitch, while Justice Shirley Abrahamson, who also dissented, said she would have sent the case back to the Circuit Court for an evidentiary hearing on the Sheriff's Department's policy involving the public use of police phones."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/24/arts/review-dance-nine-works-performed-by-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Review/Dance; Nine Works Performed By the Deaf", "date": "1990-11-24T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 24, 1990, Section 1, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

But dancers also need strong, reasonably sophisticated choreography that makes the most of their gifts and is sensitive to their liabilities. And choreography was the weakest element in a program of nine pieces presented by the company in \"A Sign of the Times\" on Nov. 16 at the Triplex Theater.Adrienne Ehrlich-Miller, who established the company in 1986, has gathered together a group of personable performers and engaging young apprentices. Rhondee Beriault has a wistful charm that goes well with her gentle, lyrical way of moving. Monika Barglow has an affecting brightness, and Rachel Odoroff dances with a keen edge that is unusual in this company. Christopher Smith has a jazz dancer's lithe style, precision and charm. And Samuel Caraballo's slightly brooding quality added dramatic nuance to what he did, though he seems to have a gift for comedy that was largely unexplored.Surprisingly, it was difficult to detect the dancers' inability to hear the scores used in some dances, made up for by imperceptible counting of rhythms and the use of lighting patterns to suggest the timing and sequence of a dance. A sense of the soundless world was palpable in the dances without scores, particularly in a theater-dance piece by Ms. Barglow that was developed in the company's program for deaf choreographers.There were a few standouts on the program, which also included work by Ms. Ehrlich-Miller, Mr. Caraballo, Karim Karim, Mr. Smith and Ms. Odoroff, who directs the company with Ms. Ehrlich-Miller. The most compelling, polished-looking piece was Ms. Ehrlich-Miller's \"Lion's Den,\" a sultry duet danced by Ms. Beriault and Mr. Smith to music by Peter Gabriel, which depicted love turning into cruel aggression. But the strongest dance sequences were those drawn from sign language expanded into swaying, charged motion for the entire body.The program also included \"The Flower That Shattered the Stone,\" a dance that incorporated sign language. Lori Fischer sang the John Denver song. The piece was staged by Ms. Ehrlich-Miller, and performed by Alina Engelman, Alma Lynn Flores, Sylvie Marc-Charles, Lorena Rosario and Jessica Tuitt, all impressive child performers from the American Dance Theater of the Deaf school in Brooklyn."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/nyregion/new-jersey-q-a-rose-marie-wade-helping-the-deaf-in-fighting.html", "headline": "NEW JERSEY Q & A: ROSE MARIE WADE;\n\nHelping the Deaf in Fighting Addiction", "date": "1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "LEAD: ROSE MARIE WADE lives in, and signs in, two worlds: one where people talk and listen to one another; the other, the deaf world, which is filled with silence.ROSE MARIE WADE lives in, and signs in, two worlds: one where people talk and listen to one another; the other, the deaf world, which is filled with silence.Mrs. Wade was born a normally hearing child of two deaf parents, both of whom lost their hearing as young children - her mother from spinal meningitis, her father after a bout of scarlet fever. As a result, she says, English became her ''second language'' after American Sign Language.A certified interpreter for the deaf, and one of only about 100 in the state, Mrs. Wade sees firsthand that New Jersey's estimated 700,000 hearing-impaired residents face very much the same daily and personal problems as does the hearing population.The difference, she observes, is that help for the troubled deaf, particularly counseling support for those with addiction problems, is difficult to find here. At least 10 percent of the deaf population struggles with drug or alcohol abuse, according to the Health Department.Mrs. Wade has been an interpreter for the deaf since she was 3 years old.

Q. Why does your background particularly qualify you to interpret for the deaf in sensitive circumstances like counseling? A. Because I was born into the deaf world and was signing before I spoke English, I can sense what a deaf person wants to communicate almost before he or she lets me know. Apparently I convey this to my clients, because some of them have told me they find it hard to believe I am not deaf. Q. Doesn't American Sign Language simply translate through a hand sign exactly what is being said in English? A. No. A.S.L. is a kind of manual shorthand with phrases and idioms all its own. It was developed as an ''underground communication,'' or secret language, by students of my mother's generation at schools for the deaf. These students were encouraged to lip-read and to try to speak and were not allowed to use sign language openly.Now, however, it is favored over English, since translating word for word is often time-consuming and too great a strain. As it is, a counseling session will take about 50 percent longer when interpreting is required. Q. Can you explain American Sign Language? A. Yes. In A.S.L., the sign for ''car,'' ''truck'' and the verb ''to drive'' are all the same. But in signed English, I use the original sign for the verb ''to drive,'' plus the first letter of ''car'' or ''truck.'' Q. Isn't this confusing for young people? A. It is difficult for a person who knows only A.S.L. to read and write regular English. Consequently, it is particularly important for materials written for the deaf community to be edited for simplicity. Q. How did you learn English? A. Fortunately, my parents appreciated how important it was for me to be part of the hearing world. So, when I was very small, my mother would plug a radio into the wall and let it play all day so I could hear normal conversation. Later, she did the same with a television. Q. Does the deaf population gravitate toward alcohol and drug abuse more than the hearing population? A. There are no state statistics or studies on addiction in the deaf world because New Jersey has not had much programming for the deaf in this area. I know from my clients, however, that addiction problems among the deaf mirror those in the hearing world. Q. How then can they get help? A. It is still very hard in New Jersey. Currently, only six A.A. meetings per week in the whole state have an interpreter. There is no residential care at all for the deaf here, and only a smattering of counseling centers make interpreters available for individual therapy. Q. Have you ever interpreted for someone in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting? A. Yes, but because most of the participants at the meeting can hear, the deaf person never benefits to the same degree as the others, even with the help of an interpreter. Also, my presence as a non-A.A. person is allowable only at ''open'' A.A. meetings - that is, where sometimes family members or supportive friends are encouraged to attend in order to better understand their loved one's problems. Closed meetings are not accessible to the deaf, but it is here that deeper feelings and issues often are explored. Q. Aren't there any all-deaf meetings in New Jersey? A. Apparently there have been a few attempts to make them available. But because there are so few services for deaf addicts and no communications network, a deaf person would find it nearly impossible to locate the few meetings even if they did exist. Q. Are there other factors that make recovery more difficult for a deaf person?A. Yes. People who live in the deaf world almost always battle the problem of isolation. This is created when hearing people are fearful of their own inability to deal with those who cannot hear. The deaf often see fearful behaviors as an indication that they are not liked. Q. Is that why you are able to help in a counseling setting? A. I think so. Because I'm a person from their world - and they know that - my deaf clients trust me to interpret the hearing world for them and, more importantly, they feel safe to speak about their feelings through me. Q. Trust, then, is a key issue for the deaf? A. Yes. Deaf people often feel very defensive simply because they cannot hear what it being said about them. Q. Does the trust issue complicate the recovery process? A. Yes, it does. Many addictive deaf people really want to get sober but, like anyone else, they need outside support. The way things are today, without any 12-step meetings strictly for the deaf, there is limited access to sponsorship - an important element in recovery - and limited choice in counseling.We know that the state is mandated to provide treatment for the deaf. But it is only through an adequate availability of interpreters that the offices of help can be brought to the hearing impaired."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/nyregion/new-jersey-q-a-rose-marie-wade-helping-the-deaf-in-fighting.html", "headline": "NEW JERSEY Q & A: ROSE MARIE WADE;\n\nHelping the Deaf in Fighting Addiction", "date": "1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "LEAD: ROSE MARIE WADE lives in, and signs in, two worlds: one where people talk and listen to one another; the other, the deaf world, which is filled with silence.ROSE MARIE WADE lives in, and signs in, two worlds: one where people talk and listen to one another; the other, the deaf world, which is filled with silence.Mrs. Wade was born a normally hearing child of two deaf parents, both of whom lost their hearing as young children - her mother from spinal meningitis, her father after a bout of scarlet fever.

Absent, however, are the strident voices that usually accompany an exchange between 7-year-olds.Sakina and Brian are deaf and carry on conversations with their fingers and hands - and, occasionally, arms and legs as well. Although they attend schools for the hearing impaired, the two weeks they spend together each summer are the only times they live with another deaf person.''Brian is my best friend,'' Sakina said in sign language. ''I love him.''And I love you and you and you and you,'' she added, pointing at the other members of the Cosgrove family.Sharing the Hunt for CrittersThe Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that has sent poor city children on free vacations since 1877, introduced Brian and Sakina last summer, when Sakina went from her home in the East New York section of Brooklyn to spend two weeks at the Cosgroves'. They became such good friends that Sakina returned again this summer for swimming lessons in the backyard pool and more adventures in the woods behind the Cosgrove home. She has tackled swimming above water and vows, with flip-flop gestures of her hands, to learn to swim underwater by the time she leaves this summer.Sakina and Brian while away some afternoons in the woods, collecting insects and other wildlife for Brian to take to summer school and searching for an elusive snapping turtle. ''I like finding lizards and snakes and spiders,'' Brian said, using hand signs. ''It's nice to have a deaf friend to share the hunt with.''A squinched nose and small shake of Sakina's head indicate she does not share his enthusiasm for crawly critters. But then she flutters her fingers underneath her chin a moment, gestures with her arms and grins. Roz Cosgrove, Brian's mother, translates: She is captivated by fireflies.Through Day-Glo Glasses''She couldn't wait to see them when she got here,'' Mrs. Cosgrove said. ''In the evening, she and Brian go down toward the woods and watch for them.''Sakina has also made the acquaintance of the cows at a nearby dairy farm in Sussex.While Brian has attended summer school, Sakina has taught his sisters, Megan, 9, and Amanda, 5, the latest in city dance steps. Their favorite group? ''New Kids on the Block, what else?'' Amanda said.Sakina has not gone entirely rural, however. She carries the fashions of the city in a pair of giant Day-Glo sunglasses. The lime-green of the frames contrasts with the faded greens and browns of the cornfields and pastures here, much as life in East New York differs from the rural pace of this town of 2,400.''Everything is different here,'' Sakina said. ''At home, I see bugs on TV. Here I see them for real.'' Again, the wrinkled face.''Kids can take things for granted and get to the point where they think everybody has a house in the country and a pool and a place to ride their bikes,'' said Ted Cosgrove, an insurance salesman. ''Having Sakina here makes my kids aware of those differences, so it's as much of a good experience for them as it is for Sakina.'''They Love Me'The Cosgroves are part of a Fresh Air Fund program called ''Friendly Town,'' in which up to 7,000 children from 6 to 16 years old visit host families in 315 different towns in the United States and Canada. About 2,500 more children will attend four fund camps on a 3,000-acre site in Fishkill.Those who wish to be a host family or to contribute to the fund are asked to call (800) 367-0003 or (212) 221-0900. Donations may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.About 60 percent of the children in the Friendly Town program return to their original host families year after year. Sakina and Brian are already talking about next year and have plans to write letters.What makes her visit so special? ''They love me,'' Sakina said, pointing to each member of the family with a smile, a sign that needs no translation."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/08/obituaries/c-d-o-connor-92-who-headed-school-for-the-deaf-is-dead.html", "headline": "C.

It represents the final phase of an ''accessibility modification'' undertaken as part of the County Center's renovation, said Richard Manley, director of the County Office for the Disabled. How the System Works When a hearing-impaired person arrives at an event he receives a headset - which can reserved in advance - and wears it throughout the performance, Mr. Manley said. Infrared transmitters on the stage ''bring the sounds directly'' to the earphones, he explained, blocking out most other noise such as the rustling and chatter of people seated nearby.The system may be used by people who have hearing problems but do not require a hearing aid and also by those using hearing aids. The version for the latter includes a ''T,'' or telecoil switch, Mr. Manley said, which allows the wearer to block out virtually all extraneous sounds.The system is not restricted to the theaters because a portable infrared transmitter is available for meetings and conferences in other rooms. ''This is really a step forward,'' said Mr. Manley, who is hearing impaired. ''At meetings and conferences in particular, a lot of people tend to talk at once.'' Other Modifications The Office for the Disabled has been working on the project with the county's Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation, which runs the County Center. Previous modifications have included the construction of a wheelchair ramp at the front entrance of the building; before, people in wheelchairs had to enter through a side loading area. Also, an elevator that runs from the basement to the second floor was installed.The Office for the Disabled has also worked with Self-Help for the Hard of Hearing, a support group. Recently, the county published ''Connections: A Resource Guide for People with Hearing Impairments,'' which gives information about listening devices, sign language, medical services and other programs for the deaf and hard of hearing.The American Telephone and Telegraph Company provided money for a combined booklet. There had been ''two separate books, for the deaf and the hearing impaired,'' Mr. Manley said. ''These two populations are different yet have many needs in common. We decided to present as much information as possible in one complete guide.''/NM"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/20/nyregion/suny-graduating-first-deaf-student.html", "headline": "SUNY Graduating First Deaf Student", "date": "1990-05-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 20, 1990, Section 12WC, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Moving from the world of the deaf to the hearing world has been challenging, Miss Banks said, but the 22-year-old woman, who was born hearing and became deaf as a result of meningitis when she was 18 months old, said she welcomed challenges.''Before, I was always involved where everyone was deaf, deaf, deaf,'' Miss Banks said. ''And I got bored with it. I wanted to move. When I came to SUNY I felt the school was a good one for me, because it is mainstreaming for me.'' Recently selected as one of the five ''best and brightest disabled college graduates of 1990'' by Mainstream, a magazine of the ''able disabled'' published in San Diego, Miss Banks, an actress, director and playwright, is working on establishing her own theater company for deaf minority actors in Manhattan.At Purchase, she participated in the Black Students Association and the Drama Studies Organization. She is also a member of Black Deaf Advocates, a national organization that has an office at Lehman College in the Bronx.Her desire to find a first-rate drama-studies program motivated her to leave Gallaudet in her sophomore year and apply to the State University at Purchase. When she arrived at the college, however, she realized that the campus was unprepared for her. ''They didn't know how to deal with me as a deaf person. I had a tough time finding interpreters when I first came here in the fall of '87,'' Miss Banks said, speaking in sign language to Heidi Halpine, a freelance interpreter. Few Interpreters in County Because there are only a few interpreters in Westchester, and most of them have jobs, Miss Banks said, the Office of Student Affairs at Purchasehad difficulties finding interpreters. For the first five weeks she was at college there was no interpreter and she decided to leave that first semester.However, she returned the next semester and ''the college got one interpreter who interpreted all five of my classes. They learned to get interpreters before the semester started; before that it was last minute. Each successive year it got better. Last summer I had three different interpreters. It was great,'' she said.Her love of acting and the theater began in childhood. ''I started my interest first when I saw somebody performing on TV. I felt it was different; it involved a lot of emotions and a lot of physical movement, and I just gaped and knew I wanted to act like that,'' Miss Banks recalled.Her parents have supported her pursuit of acting as a career. Her father, a medical photographer for the National Institutes of Health of Bethesda, Md., encouraged her to stay in school and get a college degree. Her mother, a supervisor for Deaf Family Services for the Association of Catholic Charities in Baltimore, told her when she was a child, ''You can do it; you can do whatever you want with your life,'' and took her to her first stage play. Building Theater Experience ''That was it, I fell in love,'' Miss Banks said. ''I knew I wanted to be an actress and become involved in the theater world and I began participating in church plays and school plays and outdoor community plays. I continued in theater through school and I'm still doing it now,'' Miss Banks said.Family encouragement continues to be strong. Her mother arranged a busload of 32 people from Washington to come and see her senior project, ''Waiting for Godot'' by Samuel Beckett, which she directed. ''They're very supportive. I love my family. Whatever I do, they come,'' she said - and that includes a 26-year-old brother, James. Her parents and brother, she said, all know sign language.The production of ''Waiting for Godot,'' which was performed at the college in March, featured five deaf actors from Lehman College in the Bronx. Miss Banks said that she felt a special affinity for the play and added that she hoped it will be one of the first productions of her new company. ''I felt I could relate to the play, and it was a challenge. I like to do complicated, very tough material, and I felt the play related to the deaf community also - it is about two homeless men who are hopelessly waiting for nothing, basically. It's the same with the deaf community. They kind of stay together and wait and have hopes something will happen to them,'' she said, adding: ''but they can't do that. They have to make something happen themselves.''After graduation, Miss Banks said she planned to live in Manhattan, where she has been interning with Amaryllis Theatrical Productions, a group of hearing actors who perform for ethnic communities nationwide.She could go back to her hometown of Washington and work in theater there, but doesn't feel that is the place for her at this time. Energetic and determined to create a place for herself in the New York theater world, she said: ''So many things are happening in New York. I want to stay here and work with my company, the Onyx Theater Company.'' Establishing the Company She is trying to arrange finances for the company, as well as to find rehearsal space and people to work with her. She already has a director of development, an administrative assistant and a directing assistant and is being helped also by the head of the Amaryllis Theatrical Productions, a five-year-old organization she said had some know-how in setting up a new organization.With her own experience of crossing the line into the hearing world, Miss Banks is aware of the distance that, as a rule, exists between the world of those who can hear and those who can't. Most of the people she and other deaf people meet don't know much about deafness - or disabilities in general, she said.''I feel hearing people should explain to children when they're young, not just about deafness but about every kind of disability so that when the children are growing up they know what to do and don't say 'Oh my God' when they meet someone disabled - it's just not the way to approach people. We're all people,'' she said.She would also like to see sign language taught in more places, especially in junior high and high school, and offered as a foreign language. She believes that if more people were motivated to learn sign language, some of the gaps between the two groups could be narrowed. A Matter of Understanding Both groups, she said, would profit by better understanding each other. ''I'd like people to know that deaf people can do whatever they want to do. It's important for deaf people to show their abilities, their skills to the world,'' she said, adding: ''I am deaf and I can't hear but I'm able to do everything but hear. So I feel that people should be more willing, more open to deaf people who want to work with hearing people.''Then hearing people will begin to understand more about deafness and communicate more. I feel that hearing people should be more understanding, more sensitive to deaf people's needs in the community.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/30/us/law-testing-privacy-rights-in-the-world-of-the-deaf.html", "headline": "  Testing Privacy Rights in the World of the Deaf", "date": "1990-03-30T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 30, 1990, Section B, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison here.But crucial evidence that helped convict him of murder, rather than manslaughter, exists for only one reason: He is deaf, as was Ms. Teeters, along with their children. That made for an extraordinary trial and, now, a novel debate over the constitutional right of privacy.Shortly before the killing, the two had an angry telephone ''conversation'' via a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, or T.D.D., which left a printed transcript of their words.That transcript, prosecutors argued, proved that Mr. Rewolinski acted with premeditation, the key element in murder. But he and his lawyers maintain that he acted spontaneously and that the transcript was illegally seized and used - that it was, in fact, wiretapping. They are seeking a new trial, or at least a reduced sentence for manslaughter.Tech v. the ConstitutionThe Rewolinski case, now before the Wisconsin Supreme Court, illustrates the difficulty of applying an abstract legal principle like the Constitution's prohibition against ''unreasonable searches and seizures'' to technology like a T.D.D. The case also highlights challenges faced by the courts in accommodating the singular world of the deaf.On the day of the killing, police officers in Pierce County, a rural area across the state line from Minneapolis, pulled over Mr. Rewolinski for speeding. He was not arrested, but he was brought into the local sheriff's office. While there, he called Ms. Teeters at their home and asked her to pick him up.They ''spoke'' on the T.D.D., which every police department receiving Federal funds is required to have. Alfred Sonnenstrahl of Telecommunications for the Deaf, a deaf rights group in Silver Spring, Md., said there are 250,000 to 300,000 such machines now in use around the country.Mr. Rewolinski and Ms. Teeters began arguing, a common occurrence in their relationship, which was fraught with abuse, infidelity and discord. ''I am scared to death you will make us die in car accident,'' Ms. Teeters typed into the machine, with the words appearing simultaneously on a video screen and on a cash register-like tape at the sheriff's department.''You just turn steering wheel, never know,'' she added.At other points she asked if he planned to rape her, and Mr. Rewolinski conceded that he had hit her a month earlier.Battling for a TapeWhen he left the sheriff's office, he ripped the tape off the machine and tried to take it with him. But, asserting that it was state property, a sheriff's deputy tore it out of Mr. Rewolinski's fist.A few hours later, Mr. Rewolinski killed Ms. Teeters.An extraordinary eight-day trial was held in November 1987, in a rural Wisconsin courtroom specially outfitted with five interpreters of sign language, three video monitors for displaying simultaneous written translations and a screen around the defendant to keep any deaf witnesses or deaf spectators from intercepting his signs to his lawyers. A jury convicted Mr. Rewolinski of murder.What Might Have BeenNow 39 years old, he is serving his time in the prison here, a forbidding, Dickensian structure with turrets and crenellations that is nearly as old as the state of Wisconsin itself.To his lawyers, the central issue is what happened to him at the sheriff's office hours before the killing. Had he not been deaf, the lawyers say, he could have called home from any public telephone and his incriminating words could not legally have been recorded, seized and used against him. Nor, they say, would they have been recorded over an ordinary phone in the sheriff's office.As a private citizen who was not under arrest at the time, they say, Mr. Rewolinski was entitled to assume that his conversation was not being monitored. Seizing the paper tape, they say, amounts to after-the-fact eavesdropping or wiretapping by the authorities.Their argument comes down to this: Mr. Rewolinski's dependence on special technology should not reduce his right of privacy.''The state violated the defendant's constitutional rights just as surely as if it had broken into his home to steal his personal letters, just as surely as if it had tapped his telephone,'' the lawyers, Brady C. Williamson and Jeffrey J. Kassel of the Madison, Wis. firm of LaFollette & Sinykin, have argued in court papers.What the Prosecution SaysLawyers for the state argue that having used a machine in a public area of the sheriff's office, with an official standing nearby, the defendant could have had no legitimate expectation of privacy. ''The dispatch area of a jail is not an area society as a whole would view as deserving the most scrupulous protection from government intrusion,'' they argue. ''It is an area pervaded by government intrusion.''The case will be argued in early June, with a decision expected later that month.If not for the tape, Mr. Rewolinski's lawyers argue, he might well have convinced the jury that he killed Ms. Teeters in a fit of rage. At trial, he testified that he strangled her only after she accused him of being an unfit father and threatened to keep him away from his children. ''I just lost it,'' he later said. ''I blew it. I just lost my mind and immediately I put her in a headlock. I don't know what happened.''Manslaughter in WisconsinIn Wisconsin, killing ''in the heat of passion'' constitutes manslaughter, whose maximum penalty is 10 years, Lawyers for the Wisconsin Department of Justice say that even though he was not technically in custody, Mr. Rewolinski was in the same position as an inmate or any citizen, deaf or not: whether someone is speaking over a telephone or a T.D.D., his expectations of privacy in a police station must be limited, yielding to the superior security concerns of the authorities.''The privacy interest of a person who makes a telephone call from a police station or jail is outweighed by what must be conceded to be the paramount interest of that institution to monitor, record and preserve a record of all such calls, whether they be oral or taped via a T.D.D. machine,'' Assistant Attorney General Sally L. Wellman has argued in court papers.A few minutes after he had strangled the 27-year-old Ms. Teeters, pulling a canvas belt so tightly around her neck that the belt broke into three pieces, Mr. Rewolinski called the Pierce County Sheriff's Department and confessed to the crime.''I lost my mind,'' he typed, into the machine that Ms. Teeters had used only hours before in talking to him. ''Cathy is dead. Please come and take me to jail, but don't let my kids see Cathy's body in bathtub. Please get here immediately.'' #4 Witnesses Are Deaf Mr. Rewolinski's lawyers concede that the judicial system has gone to great lengths to accommodate their client. Counting Mr. Rewolinski, at least four main witnesses in the case were deaf. The cost of interpreters and special video technology, along with sequestering the jury, amounted to more than $63,000, nearly a quarter the annual budget of Pierce County.''In all honesty, I think he got a fairer trial than most people who can speak or hear,'' said Judge Robert W. Wing of Pierce County Circuit Court, who presided. ''We bent over backwards to make sure Mr. Rewolinski understood everything.''Mr. Rewolinski, who supported his family on Social Security benefits and from peddling sign-language cards, was provided a public defender at the trial and is now represented by the firm founded by Philip F. LaFollette, a former Governor and member of Wisconsin's most illustrious political dynasty.It was in 1923, while Philip LaFollette's father, Robert (Fighting Bob) LaFollette, was Senator, that the Wisconsin Supreme Court created an exclusionary rule, ruling that the State Constitution barred the use of improperly obtained evidence at trial. That was more than 40 years before the United States Supreme Court similarly construed the Fourth Amendment.Keeping the System BalancedWhile the issue in the Rewolinski appeal is narrow, the deaf man's lawyers say such cases help reiterate and redefine the character of the law. ''Cases like this help keep the system balanced and even,'' Mr. Williamson said. ''At the risk of sounding saccharine, the rights that get established in cases like this affect everyone's rights.''Last November, Judges Daniel LaRocque and Gordon Myse of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals rejected Mr. Rewolinski's argument. They ruled he had not shown he had a reasonable expectation of privacy, particularly since he could have turned off the printer attached to the T.D.D. Presiding Judge R. Thomas Cane disagreed, but concurred in the result, ruling that the admission of the tapes made no difference in the outcome of the case.Mr. Rewolinski is less interested in constitutional principles than in getting a new trial and, he hopes, reducing his conviction to manslaughter. That would allow a move to a prison with less security, where he would be freer to move around and, perhaps, would find more deaf inmates.There are only two other deaf prisoners here. One, who lost his hearing in Vietnam, does not know sign language, while the other does - but in Spanish. Some of Mr. Rewolinski's fellow inmates have tried to learn some sign language from him, but he says it is too tiring to teach. It is also illegal in a place where, for security reasons, inmates are forbidden to speak anything but English.It is even hard getting fellow prisoners' attention, since most do not like to be touched. Mr. Rewolinski spends his days making ceramics and officiating at intramural sports contests. ''We use him as a referee in softball and basketball,'' said Glen Link, a prison official. ''That way the inmates can swear at him all they want.''Through an interpreter, Mr. Rewolinski said: ''Prison for a deaf person is really lonely. I speak with my hands, and I feel as if I've lost them here, as if they've been cut off.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/10/sports/sports-people-basketball-deaf-player-released.html", "headline": "Deaf Player Released", "date": "1989-11-10T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 10, 1989, Section D, Page 18Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

So said Edith Shapiro, president of the county's chapter of the national organization called Self Help for Hard of Hearing People; and Ruth Rabiner, coordinator of a new center where these devices are demonstrated.JUST about anyone who is hearing-impaired is familiar with hearing aids, but far fewer people know about assistive listening and alerting devices. So said Edith Shapiro, president of the county's chapter of the national organization called Self Help for Hard of Hearing People; and Ruth Rabiner, coordinator of a new center where these devices are demonstrated.The Assistive Listening and Alerting Device Demonstration Center opened last Monday at the County Medical Center here. The space in the Macy Pavilion was provided by the center's department of Otolaryngology. The center's staff is made up of volunteers from Self Help for Hard of Hearing People and is open to the public by appointment. (Call 285-7294). The devices will be demonstrated and described, but are not for sale. (The Burke Rehabilitation Center in White Plains also runs an Assistive Listening and Alerting Device Demonstration Center. It is open by appointment from 2 to 4 P.M. Fridays. Call 948-0050, extension 2315.) ''We felt there was a strong need for people to know about these items, and we wanted to teach them,'' said Mrs. Shapiro, who is hearing impaired. 'Tremendous Frustration' ''It is important to teach people what is out there,'' added Mrs. Rabiner, a psychotherapist whose hearing is normal but who has an interest in the problems of those with impairments. ''The hard of hearing experience tremendous frustration because often people do not realize the extent of their problems. They forget to speak clearly, or with good light shining on their lips if they are with someone who still has some degree of hearing. Also, telephones can be a very big problem. These devices help.''The instruments were introduced to this country 10 years ago and in Europe 20 years ago, Mrs. Rabiner said. They work by reducing background noise and can be used either in conjunction with hearing aids or alone.Visually, the devices are ''as small as a pack of cigarettes, or a small alarm clock,'' she added. Some include headsets that resemble those used in portable tape recorders - ''You might look like you were wearing a Walkman.''The devices cost $35 for a simple amplifier to $1,000 for an FM-based system, said Rochelle Shotland, an audiologist at the Burke Rehabilitation Center in White Plains. Help on the Telephone For people who cannot understand speech on the telephone, there is the Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (known as T.D.D.) or Teletype (known as T.T.Y.). The message is typed on a small typewriter-like instrument that has a readout display and a cradle for the telephone receiver; the messages travel over telephone lines if both parties have the devices. A hearing person who wishes to speak to a non-hearing friend who has a T.D.D. or T.T.Y. would call a relay service, where personnel convert spoken words to written ones.Also at the center are signaling devices that substitute visual or tactile signals for auditory ones: fire alarms that flash lights instead of clanging, alarm clocks that work by vibrating a sleeper's pillow.Dr. Marie Brown-Wagner, associate director in the medical center's department of otolaryngology, said she planned to refer patients to the demonstration center, as will Ellen Anchin, a speech and language pathologist, and Debra Motz, an audiologist. ''Sometimes we can cure hearing loss with medicine and surgery, sometimes we can treat it partially and sometimes we are not successful at all,'' Dr. Brown-Wagner said. ''These devices will help people to function.'' 20 Million People Affected Hearing loss is caused by damage to the bone or to nerves within ears, Dr. Brown-Wagner explained. It may be congenital or can result from infection, trauma, vascular disorders or reactions to certain drugs. An estimated 20 million people in this country have hearing impairment and eight million of those are totally deaf, the doctor said.The national Self Help for Hard of Hearing People organization was founded in 1979, and the Westchester chapter in 1983, Mrs. Shapiro said. Locally, the group meets once a month at the Burke Rehabilitation Center. It also sponsors educational programs and encourages churches, theaters and institutions to install the special wiring necessary for certain assistive listening devices.''Hearing loss is an invisible disability,'' Dr. Brown-Wagner said. ''It may not be obvious, but it can make a person who has it feel very, very left out.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/30/nyregion/a-deaf-camper-adjusts-to-the-country-life.html", "headline": "A Deaf Camper Adjusts to the Country Life", "date": "1989-07-30T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 30, 1989, Section 1, Page 35Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

She rolled over on her stomach, fiddled with her curly blond hair and spoke briefly in sign language. All around her, children were swimming, hiking, playing kickball. Suddenly, she lost her balance and tumbled off the bench. But Tami got up smiling.One week earlier, at the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal, she had not been smiling. She had sprawled across a suitcase in a corner of the terminal and frowned. She had tried to look composed in front of her mother, Carol, but her blue eyes had been apprehensive. The 9-year-old deaf girl from Staten Island was going camping for the first time.It did not take long for Tami or the other campers to get used to being away from home. With tall trees at every turn instead of traffic lights, they discovered the magic of the outdoors. There were campfires instead of fire engines and boats instead of subways.The children learned how to milk cows, went on hayrides and made plastic bracelets in arts and crafts. They saw how many stars are in the sky on a clear night, bunked in cabins with other first-time campers and made vanilla ice cream and chocolate-chip cookies.The Fresh Air Fund, an independent nonprofit agency, has given free summer vacations to more than 1.6 million disadvantaged New York City children since 1877. Camping for First TimeAbout 2,500 youngsters will go to four Fresh Air Fund camps on the Sharpe Reservation this summer. Most of the 128 children at Camp Hidden Valley from July 18 to Aug. 2 are camping for the first time. About half of them are disabled.At Camp Hidden Valley, all the counselors and camp staff are taught sign language. There is a walkway that gradually slopes into the pool, making it easy for disabled children to get in. Able-bodied campers play and work with the disabled children.Tami could not pinpoint when she began to feel at home at the camp. Maybe it was after a long hike through the woods of the 3,000-acre camp. Maybe it was after she jumped into a pool that was larger than any she had ever seen. Maybe it was after she had deftly pulled out her flashlight one evening, as any experienced camper would, and helped a roommate squash a bug. In any case, it was clear that Tami was enjoying herself.''It's been wonderful,'' she said in sign language. ''I'm having so much fun.''There are seven deaf children at Camp Hidden Valley and Tami became their early warning system during meals. Sometimes, a deaf child was not paying attention when a counselor was using sign language. Tami would rise from her chair, race across the dining hall and alert the child. In her haste to help, she occasionally missed the instructions herself, but her intentions were good. Comforting LettersWhile Tami's mother, Carol Jones, may have worried about her, Tami assured her in letters that she was fine. When Tami was told she would be mentioned in a newspaper article, she said, in sign language, ''Make sure to tell my mother that I love her.'' Then she bounded off the bench. The Fresh Air Fund sends underprivileged New York City children to camp and to visits with volunteer host families across 13 states and Canada. It costs $249 to send a child to visit a host family and $714 for two weeks of camp.

Leeds, who is legally blind. ''I can't even read the large print.''For lawyers like Mr. Leeds, the equipment reads aloud, enlarges text and translates copy into Braille. Together with a personal computer, the technology provides a work station where lawyers can research, read, write and store information. Even Supplies Human VoicesFor the deaf and hearing impaired, the library has obtained telecommunications devices that attach to regular telephone lines and produce typed messages.Mr. Leeds has similar equipment at home for everyday needs like writing checks as well as for his work as chairman of the bar group's Committee on Legal Issues Affecting People with Disabilities and as counsel to the Mayor's Office for the Handicapped.Perhaps the most revolutionary part of the new equipment is a reader that converts typed texts into speech in one of nine different voices - including ''Perfect Paul,'' ''Frail Frank'' and ''Uppity Ursula'' - and can be adjusted for speed and intonation. The reader weighs only 17 pounds so that lawyers can bring it to court. Earphones and tape recorders can be attached.A camera magnifies material and displays it on a screen so that details as minute as the figures on the back of a $10 bill can be made out. To get a copy of a document, a Braille printer embosses at the rate of up to 20 characters per second.The equipment cost the association about $26,000 and was bought with a grant from the estate of Ruth M. Shellens, a nurse who donated much of her time reading for Recording for the Blind.Getting the equipment was only the beginning. Steven Mendelsohn, a member of the association's committee who is blind, said it was difficult to assess how many handicapped lawyers there were because denial of handicaps was common. Denial Is Also a ProblemFor example, when Mr. Leeds realized that his eyesight was failing about four years ago, he said he did not want anyone to know.''There are a lot of attorneys who are struggling along, holding documents close to their faces, who don't acknowledge that they may have a vision problem - who may not even know they have a vision problem,'' said Mr. Mendelsohn. ''The technology has changed the social dynamics so tremendously. I think you'll see a lot of people using it who were never willing to publicly identify theselves as having visual impairments.''Frederic S. Baum, the director of library services at the city bar association, said the equipment would ultimately be kept in a room off the library's third-floor reading area."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/12/nyregion/computer-program-for-deaf-children.html", "headline": "Computer Program for Deaf Children", "date": "1989-02-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 12, 1989, Section 12WC, Page 18Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

It allows students who know American Sign Language to use their sign-language competence to learn written grammar and vocabulary.A NEW computer program to help deaf children improve their reading and writing is now available. It allows students who know American Sign Language to use their sign-language competence to learn written grammar and vocabulary.The program, HandsOn, was developed by Dr. Vicki L. Hanson, a researcher at the International Business Machines Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, in conjunction with an associate at the University of California at San Diego.Dr. Hanson, who holds a doctorate in psychology, became interested in sign language while working on a graduate-school project that required, she said, ''doing something relevent in cognitive psychology as opposed to abstract research.'' Cognitive psychology examines how people acquire knowledge. How the Project Developed For the project, she conducted a survey of devices that help teach deaf people to talk, learned about sign language and got very interested in it. ''Everyone always thinks I must have had some deaf family members to get into this, but I don't,'' Dr. Hanson said. ''I was just interested from a research point of view.''While doing postdoctoral work at the Salk Institute in San Diego, Dr. Hanson met Dr. Carol Padden, a graduate student at the University of California campus there, who was also interested in sign language. The two women kept in touch and when Dr. Hanson came to I.B.M. two years ago, she saw the opportunity to develop a sign-language computer project with Dr. Padden.''The aim was to use a personal computer, combined with new video-disk technology, to aid in developing the English skills of deaf children,'' Dr. Hanson said. In 1983, the Center for Assessment and Demographics of Gallaudet College in Washington tested 1,500 deaf graduating high-school students in the United States and found that they read, on average, at about the fourth-grade level.The program the two women developed displays stories on a computer screen in both sign language and written text, accompanied by activity options. Dr. Padden, who is deaf, does the signing on the video. Signed Video Plus Written Text Dr. Hanson explained that English is like a foreign language for many deaf students, and learning to read and write is extremely difficult for them.With HandsOn, a display monitor called InfoWindow allows both signed video and written text to be presented simultaneously on the computer screen. Students touch the screen to indicate their activity choice and to complete tasks within each activity. They type their responses on a standard computer keyboard.Students can choose from several activities including ''Read a story,'' in which they read the written text. If they do not understand a line of the written text, they touch that line on the screen and the signed version appears. If they touch ''watch a story,'' students can see a signed story on the screen. For any portion of the story they can request the written text again by touching the screen.Another option is ''Answer questions about a story,'' in which students type answers to written questions about the signed stories. If they do not understand the written questions, they can touch that line and the signed version of the question appears.The final option, ''Caption a story,'' allows students to write captions for sequential segments of the signed stories. When writing the captions they can obtain help with grammar, spelling and vocabulary, again by touching the screen to see the written text.The program can be used by children of different age groups. While Dr. Hanson and Dr. Padden have geared the stories to third through fifth graders, ''it doesn't have to be a specific age,'' Dr. Hanson said.''You could make it a story at any level and type in your English text at any level,'' Dr. Hanson said. A Role Model Helps In the last year, the program has been tested by third through sixth graders at the California School for the Deaf in Fremont, Calif. It was recently demonstrated to some seventh- and eighth-grade students and a teacher, Colleen Logiodice, from the New York School for the Deaf in White Plains.Mrs. Logiodice said one reason the students were so excited about the program was that when they didn't understand a point they could press the screen, and see a role model - an adult who knew both American Sign Language and English. ''They see that English can be interpreted into sign language and sign language interpreted into English. That knowledge instills a better sense of self and they feel good about signing,'' Mrs. Logiodice said.Dr. Hanson said the present program does not look much like the original one. Most of the modifications have been based on Dr. Hanson's and Dr. Padden's classroom observations and feedback from children.''We also try very hard to incorporate teachers' suggestions,'' she said. ''And we make changes because esthetically something doesn't look good - or from a computer standpoint if something goes too slow, I have to revise it and make it go faster. So there are many things that motivate the changes.'' Focus on Science and History In addition, they have developed video disks focusing on science and history. The three original stories were ''Goldie Locks and the Three Bears,'' a story about the adventures of a young girl during the American Revolution and the tale of a deaf man who wanted to found a state for the deaf.Testing has taken place in three stages. ''First we had to make sure that the program would run and was easily used by teachers and kids,'' Dr. Hanson said. ''Then last fall we started collecting data about usage. For every time a student would press the screen we would record what they did, so we would know if they were reading the stories or watching the signing and whether they got questions right or not.''In the next phase, starting in a few weeks, they will begin to measure reading gains made by the children.Dr. Hanson, a Chappaqua resident, is one of two researchers at the Watson Research Center working in cognition. ''I.B.M. is increasingly interested in both education and in special needs,'' she said. In addition to HandsOn, she is also working on another project in deaf education and one in dyslexia."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/22/nyregion/follow-up-on-the-news-deaf-people-as-court-jurors.html", "headline": "Deaf People As Court Jurors", "date": "1989-01-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 22, 1989, Section 1, Page 36Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

He rejected JoAnn DeLong of Roaring Spring as a juror in October 1986 before the lawyers in a civil case could question her.Ms. DeLong, who lost her hearing through a childhood illness, sued the judge, R. Bruce Brumbaugh of the Court of Common Pleas. She argued in Federal District Court in Pittsburgh that her exclusion was discriminatory and against Federal law.She has won.Earlier this month, a Federal judge, Donald E. Ziegler, held that Judge Brumbaugh had violated the Federal Rehabilitation Act. It prohibits discrimination against the handicapped in any activity in which Federal funds are used - a condition that applied to the court in Blair.''Judge Ziegler found, in effect, that deaf people are capable of serving on juries, if they're knowledgeable in sign language and have an interpreter,'' says Ms. DeLong's lawyer, Robert W. Lape of Roaring Spring.By pointing to another case in Blair before another judge, Mr. Lape was able to show that deaf people can be competent jurors. In that case, tried a few months after Ms. DeLong was rejected, a deaf man was seated as a juror in a criminal trial and a unaninmous verdict was reached.Judge Ziegler noted that five jurors ''testified that the presence of the deaf juror and the interpreter was neither disruptive nor inefficient.''Actually the county moved to make amends to Ms. DeLong even before the Federal court decision. It called her for jury duty last month, and with an interpreter present, she was questioned as a prospective juror in two criminal cases. But this time lawyers twice excluded her by peremptory challenges - exclusions for which no reason need be given.Mr. Lape doubts these exclusions were ''for any proper purpose'' but acknowledges that it would be hard to prove bias in peremptory challenges."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/18/nyregion/tradition-generosity-remember-neediest-cases-fund-brooklyn-man-deaf-birth-finds.html", "headline": "A Tradition of Generosity: Remember the Neediest Cases Fund; Brooklyn Man, Deaf at Birth, Finds Validation on the Job", "date": "1988-12-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 18, 1988, Section 1, Page 66Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Inside the drab, 80,000-square-foot structure are stacks of ''hardware and houseware'' - hinges, nails, padlocks, clocks, batteries and tools for the home. 'I Really Liked It'To Henry this building is no Dickensian workhouse, but rather a place of validation. He is deaf and learning disabled and until he came to work as a stockman almost two years ago he had never in his 27 years held a job for any considerable length of time.''I visited, I really liked it, so I accepted the job,'' he signed through an interpreter when visitors stopped to talk with him last week. Slapping his hands quickly across the numbered rows, Henry explained that he matches inventory numbers on boxes with the numbers on the requisition forms and either stacks the items on the shelves or loads them for delivery.Henry is a short, intense man whose brow furrows in concentration as he gestures forcefully to a sign-language interpreter. Dressed in a purple and gray sweatshirt, dark blue pants and heavy work shoes, he seems at home.He started at the company in February 1987 on a two-week trial, during which his salary was paid by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, an organization aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The bureau asked that Henry's full name not be used.After two weeks, the supervisors at the company decided to hire him. A month later he joined the union at the plant. He recently received a merit raise, and now takes home more than $225 a week.Some accommodations have been made for Henry, said John Puliatte, a manager at the warehouse. ''If I'm in a hurry, I can't just tell him to go get a carton of 621-K's,'' Mr. Puliatte said. ''I've got to write everything down that I tell him to get. But I carry paper with me, and it only takes a second.'' Mr. Puliatte said that drivers of the lift trucks have been told to watch for Henry since he cannot hear their vehicles.Turnover among the 44 stock workers at the warehouse is usually high, Mr. Puliatte said, and Henry's reliability makes him an asset. ''I've had guys quit after a month or six months,'' Mr. Puliatte said. ''Henry could stay as long as he wants.'' 'I Want to Stay Here'''I'll never quit,'' said Henry, who frequently works overtime. ''I've seen people, they make a mistake, they get angry and they leave. But not me. I want to stay here.''The president of the warehouse company, Howard Berger, was recently asked why he would hire a deaf person. ''He shows up on time. He works hard. He needs a job,'' Mr. Berger replied. ''Why else?''Henry's success at the warehouse was three years in the making, the result of training, counseling and encouragement at the Brooklyn bureau, which also found him his job.His start at the bureau was rocky. He had trouble getting along with fellow workers and used to walk away from his workbench, distracted by the activity around him. He could not work unsupervised.Henry had limited signing skills. Tests revealed a first-grade reading level and a second-grade math level, despite education in special classes through the ninth grade. Role Model and Teacher''We decided to work with him in another kind of occupation where constant movement was a part of the job,'' said Edith Press, director of the bureau's department for the handicapped. They decided to let him try material handling at their building.Every day 275 people with varying disabilities receive vocational training at the bureau. Two floors of the bureau's offices in downtown Brooklyn are devoted to training clients with problems as diverse as deafness, learning disabilities, mental retardation, seizure disorders, orthopedic disabilities, partial paralysis and psychiatric and emotional problems.Clients at the bureau assemble and package housewares, pharmaceuticals and novelty items, services that businesses subcontract to the bureau. Henry helped carry materials to the work areas.Henry is the first deaf client to be placed at the Berger Company, Miss Press said. And she said he has smoothed the way for six more clients from the bureau, two of whom are deaf. So Henry, once uncommunicative and angry, has become a role model and teacher for clients from the bureau.When a case worker from the bureau tries to explain how proud she is of him, Henry shrugs off her praise. ''We all just work together,'' he says. An Avid Football FanHenry, whose deafness resulted from a congenital birth defect, lives in Flatbush with his parents. He is the only one of the family's 10 children who is still at home. His father is a retired porter and maintenance worker, his mother is a housewife.An avid football fan, he follows the Jets and the Giants, though he would not say which team he would root for today.He is ready with an imitation of his hero, the professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. He stands in Mr. Hogan's patented pose, hand to his ear, listening for the crowd's applause.Asked if he had ever wondered what it would be like to hear, Henry said: ''No. I'm deaf and that's O.K.'' Then he lightly struck his thumb against his chest, palm open, fingers upward. ''I'm fine,'' he signed. ''I'm fine.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/11/nyregion/a-misdiagnosed-deaf-man-s-ordeal.html", "headline": "A Misdiagnosed Deaf Man's Ordeal", "date": "1988-12-11T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 11, 1988, Section 1, Page 81Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

A defender played him closely, denying Mr. McNulty the 20-footer he can shoot with precision, so he pointed to an open man.''He's got his head in the game all the time,'' said Mike DeCirce, coach of the St. Michael's Catholic Youth Organization varsity team.Twenty-two years ago, experts doubted that Joe McNulty would ever even be able to tie his shoes. The staff at the state-run Willowbrook Developmental Center on Staten Island officially certified the then-4-year-old boy an ''imbecile,'' based on an I.Q. test.For the next 10 years, he languished in state mental institutions, acquiring physical characteristics typically associated with retarded people, like rocking, walking with an awkward gait and moving his hands constantly.But the test that led state specialists to conclude that the boy was severely retarded was given orally, and he had been deaf since birth, when he was given up for adoption. There is no indication in the records that the testers realized that the boy was hearing-impaired. $1.5 Million Malpractice Award On Oct. 31, Mr. McNulty won a $1.5 million malpractice judgment against the State of New York for the misdiagnosis of his condition.For his advocates, the award represents a chance for Mr. McNulty to receive the education he was denied during a childhood of deprivation and physical and mental abuse. The money will be used to establish an intensive deaf rehabilitation program for him. Though Mr. McNulty already has progressed enough physically to be an excellent athlete, he still needs intensive academic training.Two other malpractice and negligence suits, each seeking $10 million in damages, are pending. One suit, in state court, is against doctors and other workers at the state-run centers; the other suit, against the same defendants but in Federal court, alleges that Mr. McNulty's civil rights were violated.''Think what he might have been and what the reason was for his being where he is,'' said Dr. Jerome E. Schein, an authority on educating the deaf who evaluated Mr. McNulty and testified in his behalf in the suit that he won. ''It's just utterly senseless.'' Given Up at BirthMr. McNulty's life, as outlined by his lawyer, Joseph F. Davoli, is a chronology of abuse and neglect.In September 1962, when he was four days old, Mr. McNulty was placed in the Angel of Guardian Home, an orphanage at 6301 12th Avenue in Brooklyn that is run by Catholic Charities. His deaf mother, who was married and conceived him when she was raped, had put him up for adoption at birth.He was considered a difficult child to place for adoption because he is biracial, half black and half white. He was confined to a crib for most of the three years he spent at the Brooklyn home. In 1966, he was transferred to Willowbrook, which later became a symbol for the mistreatment of retarded people and was closed by the state this year.In his seven years at Willowbrook, which early on included a seven-month period in isolation because of a scalp condition, Mr. McNulty received large doses of tranquilizers like Thorazine, Haldol and Valium, which were routinely prescribed to patients. Eagerness to LearnIn 1973, Mr. McNulty was transferred to a state-run home in Jefferson County, where he was sexually molested by an employee there almost daily, his lawyer said. About one year later, he was transferred to a third state home in the Adirondacks, Sunmount Developmental Center in Tupper Lake.It was at Sunmount that Daniel Geller, an audiologist on staff, began to suspect that Mr. McNulty's deafness was his primary disability and that he might not be retarded at all.''When I first met him, he certainly acted like someone with retardation,'' Mr. Geller said. ''He couldn't throw a ball. He was awkward.''After a few sessions with Mr. Geller in which the boy's hearing was tested, however, the behavior and mannerisms he had picked up by mimicking other Willowbrook residents disappeared and he began to display an eagerness to learn. But his development had been so severely arrested that Mr. Geller barely knew how to begin teaching the 14-year-old boy. 'Couldn't Tell You His Name'''You are working on things children learn at 2,'' Mr. Geller recalled. ''He couldn't tell you his name.'' In 1980, the state, after further testing, officially reclassified Mr. McNulty as ''deaf and mute,'' but of normal intelligence.Mr. Geller and his wife, Deena Butcher, who also worked at Sunmount, became surrogate parents, taking the boy home from Sunmount in the evenings and teaching him sign language.Two years later, they took the 16-year-old boy with them when they moved to the Syracuse suburb of Liverpool, where he was tutored at a public high school in such skills as telling time, distinguishing between the seasons and learning the value of different coins. He also joined the school track team. He later enrolled for a year in the state's School for the Deaf in Rome.By the time Mr. McNulty reached 21, the age at which the state's obligation to provide an education ends, he could still barely read and write. Reclassified as Mildly RetardedMr. Geller sought financial assistance from the state through Assemblyman Michael J. Bragman, a Democrat from Cicero, to continue Mr. McNulty's schooling. Funds were granted to pay for one additional year at the Rome school.Mr. Geller and other advocates considered that grossly inadequate, arguing that the state had a special obligation to Mr. McNulty because of the earlier misdiagnosis. Mr. Geller filed the three lawsuits on his behalf in 1984, alleging malpractice and negligence.Shortly before the first of the suits went to trial in January 1987, the state re-evaluated Mr. McNulty. This time, he was reclassified as mildly retarded and deaf.Mr. McNulty's lawyer, Mr. Davoli, said the change was made so the state would not have to explain why it was paying for a man with normal intelligence to live at institutions for the mentally retarded. State Denies Any NegligenceThe state denied a connection between the reclassification and the lawsuit. ''Joseph's condition was a result of mental retardation and brain dysfunction and not negligence on the part of any state employees,'' R. Scott Greathead, First Assistant Attorney General, said.In the four years since the suits were filed, Mr. McNulty has lived in two state-run homes for mentally retarded adults in the Syracuse area. The residence where he now lives is operated by people who can sign.''It was apparent early on that the state was more interested in preparing a defense for the case than providing appropriate care for Joe McNulty,'' Assemblyman Bragman said.Louis J. Ganim, a spokesman for the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, said services provided to Mr. McNulty were suitable for his needs.Mr. McNulty spends about two hours a week with a speech pathologist and an additional two to three hours on academic subjects. He works 35 hours a week at a food-service job and spends 14 hours in recreation.Dr. Schein said Mr. McNulty needs far more intense instruction to make up for lost time. ''He's got a half-century ahead of him,'' he said. ''He hasn't even been to grade school.''But the rehabilitation program his advocates want to finance with the $1.5 million judgment has not begun because the state could still file an appeal. His lawyer fears time may be running out.''Joe's essence is slipping deep within him,'' Mr. Davoli said, citing signs that Mr. McNulty may never be able to overcome the trauma of his childhood."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/06/us/deaf-truck-driver-s-roadblock-is-a-federal-rule.html", "headline": "Deaf Truck Driver's Roadblock is a Federal Rule", "date": "1988-11-06T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 6, 1988, Section 1, Page 60Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The great rigs were the boy's dream: He wanted to be a truck driver.Mr. Cousins has been deaf since birth. Now, at 40 years of age, he is still trying to realize his dream. He has successfully challenged the state of Maineand now he is challenging the Federal Government over rules that prohibit the deaf from driving commercial trucks.''People are misinformed about how deaf people drive,'' Mr. Cousins said though an interpreter. ''They think they are a hazard.''In 1984 Mr. Cousins joined a state-run program for truck driver training, unaware of state and Federal restrictions against the deaf. The Maine Department of Vocational Rehabilitation was also unaware of the restrictions and, using Federal funds, paid for Mr. Cousins's course. He was first in his class of seven students. He was certified, received a driver's license and set out to find a job. 'Went From Door to Door'Not too long into the search, however, he encountered the state and Federal rules, adopted more than 30 years ago when the Government deemed deaf drivers, diabetics and amputees safety risks as drivers of commercial vehicles.''He literally went from door to door looking for a job,'' said Harold Lichten, Mr. Cousins's lawyer. ''He was probably turned down a dozen times.''In 1986, Mr. Cousins filed a complaint with the Maine Department of Human Rights, and that body ruled that the state had not proved that deaf truck drivers were safety risks. The state Department of Public Safety refused to comply. Mr. Cousins sued, but before his complaint was heard, the public safety agency rescinded the rule, saying it could not be shown that deaf people were unsafe behind the wheel.''I was very happy, not just for myself but for other deaf people who want to drive trucks,'' Mr. Cousins said.His troubles weren't over. He was still denied employment because the Federal ban on deaf drivers applies to any trip that involves Interstate transit, even if a particular driver is not hauling the goods between states. Mr. Lichten said that if a driver takes a load of lumber from a woodlot in Maine to a Maine railroad station for transportation to the South, the trip is considered Interstate transit and subject to Federal rules. 'Shouldn't Stereotype'The Federal Department of Transportation refused to grant a waiver for Mr. Cousins to drive a commercial truck, and he filed a lawsuit against the agency, charging discrimination under the Federal Rehabilitation Act. The suit is pending in Federal District Court.''We weren't saying that all deaf people should get licenses,'' said Mr. Lichten. ''All we're saying is you shouldn't stereotype all deaf people in one category.''The Department of Transportation allows commercial drivers a measure of hearing loss, but not to be totally deaf. The Federal rule says that to qualify, a driver must perceive a forced whisper in the better ear at not less than five feet, with or without a hearing aid.Mr. Cousins is stone deaf, the result, he said, of his mother coming down with measles while she was pregnant with him.''There's a lot of noise out there that tells you something's wrong,'' a department employee said. ''A professional driver is held to a greater proficiency and safety than other drivers. A totally deaf person is at greater risk than if he's not deaf and, if he's at greater risk, then the motoring public is too.''Officials of the Transportation Department cited the trucks' size, 8 feet wide and 60 feet long, and their tremendous power as reasons for setting more stringent restrictions on commercial drivers than on drivers in general. Most states allow deaf people to drive their own vehicles.Tractor trailers have 5 to 20 forward speeds and ''the driver is under stress the whole time he's driving,'' an official said.The transportation officials say the driver must be able to hear normally audible alarms in the cab, horns from other cars, or sirens from emergency vehicles. Also, they asked, how is a driver to communicate with other drivers s in an emergency? Deaf Drivers May Be SaferMr. Lichten calls the Government's position ''nonsense.'' He said a study by a researcher at Gallaudet College, a school for the deaf in Washington, D.C., showed that deaf people are actually better drivers than people with normal hearing.''Maybe hearing is a distraction,'' said Mr. Lichten, adding that drivers are often listening to the radio as they drive, shutting out outside noises.The lawyer said technology had advanced to the degree that many of the transportation agency's concerns are no longer valid. For example, portable teletype machines are available for communicating with a driver's home base, or with law-enforcement officers on the road, and sensors can be attached to warn the driver that emergency vehicles are approaching.Deaf people also compensate with their other senses, he said. As a passenger in a truck, Mr. Cousins once detected a tire problem. He felt a strange vibration that the driver had not noticed.For Mr. Cousins, who is unemployed and drawing weekly workman's compensation checks, driving a truck means a good living to support his wife and two daughters. If he wins this battle, he is guaranteed a job with Dugas Express, a trucking company based in Lewiston, Me.But trucking also means a life of peace. ''It's a quiet job, a lot of solitude,'' Mr. Cousins said. ''No one's pressuring you. You just go at your own pace.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/23/us/gallaudet-university-installs-deaf-president.html", "headline": "Gallaudet University Installs Deaf President", "date": "1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 23, 1988, Section 1, Page 45Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

King Jordan as the first deaf president in the history of the nation's only university for the hearing-impaired.Dr. Jordan, who is 45 years old, was named president of the 124-year-old university last March after a tumultuous week of protests in which students and faculty banded together to protest the selection of Dr. Elisabeth Ann Zinser, who is not deaf, over Dr. Jordan and another deaf finalist.''Today Gallaudet is not simply installing its eighth president,'' Dr. Jordan told about 2,500 teachers, staff members and students in the school's gym in his inaugural address today. ''We are recognizing the right of every disabled person to have unlimited goals and expectations.'' More Deaf TrusteesThe demonstrations in March grew from an isolated campus protest to an international forum on deaf rights, with members of Congress and several Presidential candidates calling for selection of a deaf leader for the school. Dr. Zinser stepped aside, and Dr. Jordan was selected.The protests also led to the selection of a deaf person to replace Jane Bassett Spilman as head of the school's trustees.The new chairman of the trustees, Philip W. Braven, announced today that the university intended to make deaf people a majority on the 21-member board.Last March, student protesters, complaining that nondeaf trustees and leaders were insensitive to their condition, demanded that the deaf presence on the board be increased. At the time, just four deaf members sat on the board, the minimum required by the bylaws.In his address, Dr. Jordan said the school should use the energies generated that week to continue lobbying for the rights of the hearing-impaired around the world.''Gallaudet must become a working model for open access everywhere,'' he said. ''Take the events of last March to your hearts and your hands to make the world responsive to deaf people.'' Emancipation from 'Limitations'Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, whose brother is deaf, delivered part of his remarks in sign language, drawing appreciative cheers from the audience. He called those who struggled for selection of a deaf leader ''my heroes.''He told an anecdote about how far word of Dr. Jordan's selection had spread: ''Last summer, I was in Europe, and a group of deaf students wanted to know about the president. They weren't interested in Ronald Reagan. They wanted to hear about Dr. Jordan.''Lawrence Newman, president of the National Association of the Deaf, told the crowd that Dr. Jordan's installation ''marks the emancipation of deaf people from the shackles of limitations.''Dr. Jordan, a 1973 Gallaudet graduate who earned a master's and a doctorate in psychology from the University of Tennessee, was dean of Gallaudet's School of Arts and Sciences before being selected as president. A Challenge to SucceedDr. Jordan, who lost his hearing in a motorcycle accident in 1968, pledged to expand programs preparing Gallaudet's 2,200 undergraduate and graduate students for a larger place in the hearing world.''I challenge every person in this room to take up his motivation and have the courage to try and do anything under the sun,'' Dr. Jordan said. ''I challenge you to succeed.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/15/business/patents-a-public-phone-aid-for-hearing-impaired.html", "headline": "A Public Phone Aid For Hearing Impaired", "date": "1988-10-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 15, 1988, Section 1, Page 42Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Though relatively portable, the devices have been difficult to operate at public phones, which rarely provide a platform or electrical power outlets.The new device is mounted underneath a pay telephone, and is encased in a closed metal drawer to thwart vandalism. When a caller dials a phone connected to another TDD, the device is programmed to recognize the other unit's signal, unlock its drawer and roll out for the caller to use. When the caller hangs up, the unit rolls back into its case.Based in Madison, Wis., Ultra Tec is marketing the invention to local telephone companies and independent pay-phone manufacturers.The company received patent 4,777,469."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/24/nyregion/view-national-theater-for-deaf-bringing-change-one-play-time.html", "headline": "The View From: The National Theater for the Deaf; Bringing Change, One Play at a Time", "date": "1988-07-24T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 24, 1988, Section CN, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The 12-member acting company includes only two members who can hear; they speak aloud during the company's performances, which blend spoken language with signing. Audiences are composed mainly of hearing people.On its annual tours, the company has given nearly 5,000 performances, in 50 states and 26 countries, in small towns and big cities. ''We have not missed a gig,'' said Mr. Hays, who recalled that a couple of times blizzards caused cancellations, because the audiences were unable to reach the theaters, but that the company never canceled first. 'King of Hearts' TourThe company members limbering up on the scaffolding were preparing to rehearse ''King of Hearts,'' with which the company will tour 22 states during the 1988-89 season, with four performances in Connecticut. The company has performed works ranging from tragedies to farces; ''King of Hearts'' is based on the French film of the same name, directed by Philippe DeBroca.The company also splits up at times into two Little Theaters of the Deaf, which perform mainly for children. It performs in Chester at Christmastime; conducts free storytelling sessions every June on the Chester green, and each summer conducts a four-week professional school for deaf theater personnel from America and abroad.Wang Ling, an ambitious 20-year-old from Beijing, came to the school this year for help in carrying on his father's dream. All over America and in other places as well - including Australia, England, India, Japan and Sweden - are theaters of the deaf that were formed with help and instruction from the company.The company is financed through its performance fees, private donations and the Federal Government. ''We took on Federal support with the idea that we were theater people first,'' said Mr. Hays. ''We are not social workers here, but we are proud of the power of our profession.'' For one thing, said Mr. Hays, company performances have removed the stigma from signing and have shown it to be a rich, expressive language. ''We brought sign language out of the closet,'' he said.The company also brought sign language to Chester, which became the troupe's permanent home - it was originally part of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford - in 1983. Since then, many shopkeepers and other residents have learned to sign. 'Total Communication'Mr. Hays also said that the company's use of sign language has brought about a change in educational methods. Until recently, many schools for the deaf discouraged their students from signing, but now more schools use what is called total communication, which includes both signing and speech. And, Mr. Hays said, ''The N.T.D. helped blow open the job market.'' ''When we started this company, there were few job opportunities for deaf people, but the understanding of deaf people's abilities has opened up jobs for the deaf,'' he said, adding that now, young deaf people are ''growing up aware'' that they can pursue various careers.He said role models like the company's performers helped produce the recent successful protests at Gallaudet College in Washington, D.C., the world's only liberal arts college for the deaf. This spring, Gallaudet students staged protests when Dr. Elisabeth Ann Zinser, a hearing woman who did not know sign language, was appointed president of the school. The protests brought the resignation of Dr. Zinser and the appointment of Dr. I. King Jordan, Gallaudet's first deaf president.Now, Mr. Hays said, he hopes the N.T.D. can help lead deaf people in China - where they are often shunted into factory jobs - ''up and out.'' He is lending a hand to Wang Ling, who seeks to continue the project his father, who is now dead, began after working with the company in China.In 1986, the N.T.D. became the first American theater company to tour China. Accompanying the company performers in Beijing and six other cities was Wang Ling's father, Wang Zhen-Tai, a Chinese actor who spoke in Mandarin as the company signed on stage. He was so impressed with the company that he decided to start a theater of the deaf in China. He visited factories where groups of deaf employees had amateur theatrical groups and auditioned the performers.Last summer, he brought four young Chinese performers to the N.T.D.'s professional school for training. Mr. Wang died of heart disease soon after he returned to China, but his son vowed to carry on, and wrote Mr. Hays to tell him of his plan. Mr. Hays wrote back, cautioning Wang Ling - then a business student at Beijing International Business College - -against devoting himself to an endeavor for which he might not be suited. But Wang Ling persisted, working his way through the Chinese bureaucracy in search of money and support. ''He's up against old, experienced bureaucrats, but he can swim upstream,'' said Mr. Hays.Wang Ling said he was starting the Chinese theater partly out of respect for his father. Also, he said, ''It's a very meaningful thing to do. China needs an organization like that.''On his return to China, Wang Ling will try to arrange for a young deaf actress to be released from her factory job for two weeks so that she can join the National Theater of the Deaf at the International Theater Festival in Tokyo, Aug. 14-18. Mr. Hays and Wang Ling feel that her participation will spur support for a Chinese theater of the deaf.The National Theater for the Deaf will perform at the festival with the Japanese theater of the deaf - a troupe that the N.T.D. helped to start. The American company has toured Japan several times, often staying with teachers and performers in the Japanese troupe. ''I feel like we're neighbors,'' signed Sandi Inches, an N.T.D. performer who is deaf, as she explained through a sign language interpreter how much she looked forward to the August event.N.T.D. performers said they were also looking forward to working on ''King of Hearts,'' which will open this fall in Denver and reach Connecticut next winter, with performances Jan. 20 (Kingswood Oxford School, West Hartford), Feb. 16 (University of Connecticut, Storrs), Feb. 19 (Southern Connecticut State University, New Haven), and Feb. 24 (University of Bridgeport, Bridgeport).The plot deals with a World War I soldier who finds himself in a town whose inhabitants have all escaped from a mental hospital. ''But it's not an insane asylum story,'' said John Eisner, a hearing actor with the company. ''The story is about love, and the importance of people to other people.''Mr. Hays is looking beyond a Chinese theater of the deaf, a Japanese festival and another successful tour. He said he wanted the company to do a feature film and to build a television series around a pilot show, ''The Light Princess,'' which it performed for Connecticut Public Television last year. He noted that the company plans to perform at a festival in Jerusalem this year and also to tour South America.And, he said, he would like the N.T.D. to tour South Africa. ''South Africa is now cut off to American artists, but I wish artists were free to travel in both directions,'' he said, noting that South African artists performing in America have been effective in drawing attention to South Africa's apartheid policies."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/17/nyregion/the-view-from-the-american-school-for-the-deaf-flagship-school.html", "headline": "THE VIEW FROM: THE AMERICAN SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF;\nFlagship School Prepares The Deaf for a Hearing World", "date": "1988-04-17T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 17, 1988, Section 12CN, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The school's executive director, Winfield McChord Jr., called the experience here and in Washington ''a wonderful prelude.''''I hope they sustain it into meaningful action that can change the destiny of deaf children,'' said Mr. McChord, one of three hearing sons of deaf parents.The demonstration here was doubly symbolic because the school was the first for the deaf in the United States. The school also shares a historical link with the university, which was renamed in honor of the West Hartford school's founder, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet.In the early 1800's, Mr. Gallaudet, a seminarian, returned home to Hartford to convalesce from a respiratory ailment and befriended a child next door, Alice Cogswell. She had lost her hearing at the age of 3.Mr. Gallaudet taught the child the word ''hat'' by writing in dirt with a stick and pointing to a hat. She became eager to learn more, and her father, Dr. Mason Fitch Cogswell, asked Mr. Gallaudet to go to England and study about deaf children.Because of the lingering bitterness in England after the War of 1812, the English were reluctant to share their new methods of teaching the deaf. By chance, Mr. Gallaudet saw an announcement for a lecture by Abbe Sicard and Laurent Clerc of the Paris School for the Deaf. After speaking with the two men, he went to Paris to study their program and later returned to the United States with Mr. Clerc to establish the school. The school, the Connecticut Asylum for the Education and Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, was initially located in Hartford and had seven students in its first class, including Alice Cogswell. That was in April 1817.The present school, which was built in 1921 at 139 North Main Street, is an imposing colonial revival-style brick structure with a columned entrance and a sweeping front lawn. Scattered about the 54-acre campus in West Hartford are a collection of buildings added over the years. The current name was adopted during the school's centennial in 1917.The mission of the school is to prepare children with hearing impairments for a hearing world. The handicap of the deaf child is not the inability to hear, but the difficulty in com-municating, said some of their teachers, 25 percent of whom are deaf.''If you can't communicate with someone, you think they're rather slow,'' Mr. McChord said. ''What it really is is a jewel you can't get to.''In 1975, Congress decided all handicapped children should be afforded equal educational opportunities and mandated that public school systems offer special education.As a result, many parents withdrew their children from special schools and enrollment at the American School for the Deaf declined from 500 students to 200. The school also began seeing more students with multiple disabilities, who account for 40 percent of the enrollment. Those with fewer handicaps were enrolling in public schools.Enrollment has since risen to 250 students in grades kindergarten through 12th grade, 89 percent of whom are from Connecticut. It is expected to climb to 300 in a few years.The reason for the gradual increase, Mr. McChord said, is that very few public schools are equipped to allow deaf students to participate fully in such activities as sports and student government.At the American School for the Deaf, one of 65 such residential schools nationwide, students can participate in routine extracurricular activities like student government, the new French club and Junior Achievement or work on the yearbook and newspaper staffs. Athletes can compete with students from hearing schools in softball, basketball, soccer, wrestling, swimming and track.''When the children got to be 12 or 13,'' Mr. McChord said, ''they began looking for more.''Miss Izzo is a prime example. Deaf since birth, her family opted to send her to public schools in Westport, her hometown. But after seventh grade, she wanted to attend a school for the deaf. ''I wanted to try being in the deaf world,'' Miss Izzo said.The student-teacher ratio at the school is, at most, 5-to-1 for the younger children and 10-to-1 for the high school students.Education by the school begins as early as infancy. The school will send a teacher to the home two hours each week to teach parents how to use hearing aid and diagnostic equipment and how to create an environment to stimulate the child's acquisition of language.''Language is the big factor, communicating orally or through sign language,'' said Neil Tabbert, dean of students. ''Parents will have weekly assignments for their children like identifying shapes and things around the room.''The earlier children lose their hearing, the more difficult it is for them to acquire language. A 6-year-old has 80 percent of the language skills he will use in his lifetime.''It's a different educational challenge if the hearing is lost after the age of 2,'' Mr. McChord said. ''These children are clinically deaf, but not educationally deaf.''Preschoolers are exposed to enormous amounts of language stimulation and reinforcement. Children who are born deaf or lose their hearing at a very early age miss all of that. ''Yet,'' Mr. McChord said, ''they have the same intelligence.''Whenever a hearing-impaired person is present, staff members use sign language, which has its own vocabulary, idioms, grammar and syntax. Instruction can also include oral communication or lip-reading. An on-site nursery school that is open to any child in West Hartford enables preschoolers with hearing impairments to socialize with other children. Some of the older students take a few courses at nearby high schools.The school offers a work-study program and assists hearing-impaired adults in finding jobs. Ninety-seven percent of last year's graduates are employed or attend college, primarily schools with programs for the deaf. The school also works with The computer has been a boon in teaching the deaf because of its visual instruction. The younger students also use a wireless group amplification system that carries the teacher's voice from a clip-on microphone to an adjustable box the size of a small portable radio hung from the student's neck.Other equipment includes machines for telephone communications, decoders for closed-captioned television programs and alarm clocks with flashing lights for students who live in the dormitories.One senior, Tommy Lorello, 17, of Stratford, is so taken with the computer technology that he is considering it as a career. Mr. Lorello may attend the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester, N.Y.Mr. Lorello, who marched in support of the demonstrators at Gallaudet, said he would like to see more access to the hearing world, mainly in the form of additional captioned programs on television.He said he would also like to see deaf athletes in professional sports and said interpreters could join the huddles with coaches and players.Mr. Lorello, whose parents are deaf, said his inability to move about freely in the hearing world makes him depressed, not angry.''We're not really handicapped,'' he said. ''We just can't hear.''Douglas Moody, the director of evaluation and assessment, agreed. ''It's not a deaf-versus-hearing issue,'' he said. ''The issue is having deaf people recognized for their individual skills or talents.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/18/opinion/the-deaf-are-heard.html", "headline": "The Deaf Are Heard", "date": "1988-03-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 18, 1988, Section A, Page 34Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Students at Gallaudet University, the nation's only college for the deaf, said the new president should be someone hearing-impaired. The trustees passed over two deaf finalists and picked Elisabeth Ann Zinser, an educator of unquestioned ability who, in the students' eyes, was doubly handicapped: her hearing is fine and she doesn't know sign language.Even when the students exploded in protest, shutting down the Washington, D.C., campus and holding orderly rallies on Capitol Hill, the trustees wouldn't listen. Jane Bassett Spilman, who was chairman of the board, insisted that the university had sought ''the best candidate, not necessarily a deaf candidate.''Yet quickly the silent protest had its effect. In one week the issue was so well understood, and the urgency of the students so overwhelming, that Dr. Zinser and Mrs. Spilman both were gone and a new, deaf president chosen. Dr. Zinser said she had learned the issue's significance and Mrs. Spilman said she was removing herself as an obstacle. Their resignations were appropriate and graceful.The student protests reverberated with clarity and elemental justice. Deafness, or at least the ability to communicate with the deaf, is not merely an asset, it was a necessary qualification. To impose a president who hadn't even learned the students' language was patronizing, even insulting. Equally offensive was the message that this 124-year-old institution could not produce a leader from the ranks of the deaf.The new president, Irving King Jordan, is deaf, a Gallaudet alumnus and its popular dean of arts and sciences. He gives every indication that he understands the potential of his office, the exciting opportunities of the moment and the challenges ahead for the handicapped. His appointment is a thrilling signal of a community's new pride in itself. That community will be heard from again."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/13/us/for-deaf-gallaudet-was-just-a-start.html", "headline": "For Deaf, Gallaudet Was Just a Start", "date": "1988-03-13T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 13, 1988, Section 1, Page 22Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them.Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.The protests at Gallaudet University, the nation's only liberal arts college for the deaf, represent the blossoming of a new civil rights movement, deliberately patterned on the black civil rights actions of the 1960's, according to deaf people and advocates for the handicapped.''Deaf people are becoming more involved in decisions that affect them, both politically and educationally,'' said Anita Farb of the National Association for the Deaf. ''They no longer want to take a back seat. And with more deaf people being better educated, they are finding that they really can make a difference.''''In the 1960s we had the black civil rights riots, and then in the 1970s and 1980s a lot of black people were able to move up to supervisory and leadership positions,'' said Claude Stout, a 34-year-old deaf man from Washington, speaking through an interpreter. ''We have a lot of deaf people out there who have become engineers and chemists and computer programmers, but none of them are moving up to supervisory jobs. This is the just the beginning, but in 10 years, maybe we'll see more deaf people moving up.'' Educational LeadershipMr. Stout said he and others who share his handicap want to see more deaf people leading education programs for the deaf. Mr. Stout said that, long before Gallaudet's newly appointed president, Elisabeth Ann Zinser, resigned Friday in the midst of a student protest, the Gallaudet alumni had been unhappy about the underrepresentation of deaf people in the school's leadership.Dr. Zinser, who will return to her former post as vice president for academic affairs at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, is not deaf and does not know sign language.Mr. Stout, who received both a bachelor's degree and a master's in business administration at Gallaudet, said that, like blacks, deaf people have been looked down on and discriminated against in schools, restaurants, movies and other public institutions.''Gallaudet is just a few blocks from the scene of the civil rights protest and riots of 1968,'' said a Gallaudet staff member, who asked not to be identified. ''In some real way, this is an extension of that movement. It's 20 years late, but things always come late to the deaf community.'' Cut Off From OthersAbout 21.2 million Americans have impaired hearing, ranging from a hearing loss to deafness. Most of those people, including the roughly 8 million with significant hearing loss in both ears, are elderly. Less than a million are deaf.Because deafness - even more than blindness or handicaps that restrict physical mobility - makes it hard to communicate, the deaf have traditionally had the hardest time making their way into the mainstream of society, in the opinion of several people associated with Gallaudet.Indeed, they note that Helen Keller, who was both deaf and blind, maintained that deafness was the greater of her two handicaps, because it cut her off from other people. And those who work with handicapped children note that, while blind children without other handicaps can usually join mainstream classes successfuly, deaf children have a much harder time.''Oftentimes, the general population equates a hearing impairment with a lack of intelligence, and looks upon people who are deaf as having subnormal intelligence,'' said Paul Medlin, senior vice president of the National Foundation for the Handicapped in Chicago. ''Many deaf children are wrongly put in classes for the developmentally disabled. The burden should be on society to accommodate the hearing-impaired person.''Exactly what kind of accommodations are required has been a subject of a good deal of litigation in recent years. In one important case, a deaf licensed practical nurse who wanted to go to school to become a registered nurse sued the school that would not accommodate her. But in 1979, the United States Supreme Court ruled against her, declaring, according to one lawyer in the case, that she could not participate fully in the clinical portion of her training because of her deafness.Since then, there has been an increase in other deaf-rights cases, mostly involving education and employment. In the early 1980's, much of the litigation revolved around the obligation of state schools and state vocational-rehabilitation agencies to provide interpreters for deaf people - a right that is mostly taken for granted now, in large part because of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which said the handicapped must be afforded ''meaningful access'' to federally financed programs. Aware of Their RightsCurrent litigation involves a wide range of issues, said Mark Charmatz, who handles litigation on rights for the deaf for the National Association for the Deaf.''What it all adds up to is that deaf people are increasingly aware of their rights, that they want the same rights as anyone else, and that they won't stand for anything else,'' he said.Employment discrimination against deaf people is widespread, civil rights lawyers say. Even those employers who have many hearing-impaired workers may treat them very differently from other workers.Mr. Charmatz cites a case against the Postal Service, which had a special recruitment program for the deaf but paid hearing-impaired workers in the program $5 an hour during a nine-month probation period while their co-workers with normal hearing earned $10 an hour and were only kept on probation for 90 days.''Last year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that that pay system was illegal discrimination, and the Postal Service's response was to drop the recruitment program,'' Mr. Charmatz said. ''But they got a lot of criticism about that, and they reinstated it.'' Hopes Rise as Barriers FallIn part, the growing activism of the deaf is part of a revolution of rising expectations: Generally, even the fiercest advocates for the deaf agree, the last 20 years have brought important advances, not only in the law but in technology and image.Deaf and hearing-impaired people are now able to use telephones, thanks to increasingly sophisticated systems that allow messages to be typed into the phone and received on a screen on the listener's phone. And captioning has made television programming increasingly accessible to the deaf.Meanwhile, many deaf students say they have been been bolstered by the success of ''Children of a Lesser God,'' a play, and later a movie, starring the deaf actresses Phyllis Frelich and Marlee Matlin. A recent Canadian movie, ''Crazy Moon,'' stars a deaf actress, Vanessa Vaughan. And Linda Bove, another deaf actress, has long been featured on ''Sesame Street.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/12/us/demonstrations-by-the-deaf-bring-a-resignation-but-not-yet-a-truce.html", "headline": "Demonstrations by the Deaf Bring A Resignation but Not Yet a Truce", "date": "1988-03-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 12, 1988, Section 1, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

They said they would continue demonstrating until a deaf president was chosen and the board of the 2,200-student school had new leadership and members with hearing problems in the majority.''I came to understand how deeply some see the social stature of deaf persons reflected in the presidency of this university,'' Dr. Zinser said in resigning. The protest demonstrations, which have shut down the Gallaudet campus this week, have become a focal point for a national drive for greater rights and opportunities for the deaf. 'We've Made the First Step'Bridgetta Bourne, a 20-year-old Gallaudet student who has been a protest leader, declared this afternoon at one of several rallies celebrating Dr. Zinser's resignation, ''We've made the first step, but we won't stop until we've gone all the way.''The chairman of the Gallaudet board, Jane Bassett Spilman, of Bassett, Va., said at a news conference with Dr. Zinser and other school officials that the board would meet in a few days to begin a search for a new president.Mrs. Spilman refused to promise that the next choice would be deaf, saying that would be up to the board. She said it would also be up to the board whether it should reconstitute itself and whether she should step aside as chairman.Under the university's bylaws, the 21-member board is self-perpetuating. The current membership consists of business, social and political figures not unlike the mix found on most university boards. However, only 4 of the 21 members have impaired hearing. The university has never had a deaf president.Mrs. Spilman promised today, in response to a protest demand, that there would be no reprisals against the protesting students or faculty members. The students have been almost unanimous in their opposition to the Zinser appointment, and more than half the faculty is on record in support of the students. Responding to 'Social Movement'Dr. Zinser said at the news conference that she would immediately return to her previous job as vice president of academic affairs at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro.She said neither she nor the Gallaudet board had anticipated the fervor and commitment of the protesters or that their protest was the leading edge of a burgeoning national movement for deaf rights. ''I have responded to this extraordinary social movement of deaf people, not to the demands of the protesters,'' she said.Dr. Zinser said the convergence of the Gallaudet protest and the national drive constituted ''a very special moment in time,'' one that was ''unique, a civil rights moment in history for deaf people.'' But she warned, ''The events in Washington this week should provide no lesson to any other college or university that an action like a campus seige will be tolerated because today is not their civil rights time.''Mrs. Spilman agreed with Dr. Zinser that ''timing and the civil rights issue'' had been major factors in the Gallaudet dispute. But she contended, as she has throughout the turmoil, that a person with no hearing problems could be an effective advocate for the deaf. And she insisted that Dr. Zinser, who has been learning sign language, had been the best qualified of the 67 candidates, most with normal hearing.''I do not accept the premise that the search process was flawed,'' she replied under insistent questioning as to whether the university's board as now constituted was the best vehicle for choosing a president for what is probably the foremost school for the deaf in the world. Broad Support for ProtestsThe demonstrations have drawn support from consumer, labor, political and civic groups. Many members of Congress, which chartered Gallaudet and still provides three-fourths of its funds, have voiced support for the protesters, and some members plan hearings on the matter next week.''You have sensitized the nation to your hopes and dreams and I stand ready to do everything I can to help,'' Representative Steve Gunderson, Republican of Wisconsin, told the protesters today at a victory rally. Mr. Gunderson is one of three members of Congress on the Gallaudet board.This afternoon the Gallaudet protesters once again took up their placards and gathered at the main gate leading to the 100-acre campus. Then they marched to the Capitol, a mile to the southwest, and there vowed loudly and enthusiastically to continue their protests until all other demands are met.''We've still got demands to get and now let's get them,'' Tim Rarus, one of the leaders of the protest, told the cheering throng of students and faculty members at the steps of the Capitol's West Front. As in almost all Gallaudet exchanges, he spoke in sign language.''Deaf Rights Now! Deaf Rights Now!'' the crowd signed back.Perhaps the most puzzling question posed by the Gallaudet dispute is whether the board should have seen the protest coming. When Gallaudet's sixth president, Jerry C. Lee, resigned at the end of last year to enter business, many students and faculty members pleaded for the appointment of a deaf president, saying the time had come to end ''oppression'' of the deaf throughout the country, particularly in filling leadership positions. Several campus marches were held to underscore the plea. Two Deaf CandidatesThe board included two people with hearing problems in its final list of presidential candidates. But Dr. Zinser got the nod of approval, by a substantial margin. Why? ''There isn't any easy answer,'' a university official familiar with the board's deliberations said, asking anonymity. ''It's your usual board with your usual mix of influential and issue-interested people and your usual way of going about business. If there's anything really different, it's that the school is for the deaf and only a few of the deaf are on the board. But I'm not sure if that's the real issue.''The secretary of the board, Frank B. Sullivan, whose hearing is impaired, said at the news conference today that it would be wrong to assume that only the hearing members of the board failed to foresee the intensity of the protest. ''Neither did we,'' he said.Many faculty members - one third are deaf - sided with the protesters. As academics and administrators, they did not question Dr. Zinser's academic or administrative qualifications; they simply argued that she was not deaf.In any case, this much is clear: By late Thursday, just before she submitted her resignation, about the only people still pushing for Dr. Zinser's presidency, certainly the only people pushing publicly, were members of the board."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/11/us/head-of-college-for-deaf-quits-after-protests.html", "headline": "Head of College For Deaf Quits After Protests", "date": "1988-03-11T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 11, 1988, Section A, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Action Called a 'Tragic Loss'The chairman of the Gallaudet trustees, Jane Bassett Spilman, called the resignation a ''tragic loss'' for the university. She said that the board, in choosing Dr. Zinser to be the seventh president of the 124-year-old school, had been impressed by her ''superior qualifications'' as a manager and administrator as shown in her last position as vice-president of academic affairs at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.The Gallaudet students and a majority of its 275-member faculty had not questioned Dr. Zinser's academic or managerial qualifications in opposing her appointment. Rather, they had argued that it was time that Gallaudet had a president with hearing difficulties, especially at a time when the rights and opportunities of the deaf and hearing-impaired were becoming a national issue all around the United States.Jerry Covell, a leader of the student protests, hailed the resignation, but said early today that students were still angry with Mrs. Spilman, who had resisted the push to reverse the appointment of Dr. Zinser.''We are glad that she resigned but we are still waiting for Spilman,'' Mr. Covell said.Before her resignation there were indications that Congress, which originally chartered the school and still provides it with most of its financing, might play a role in solving the dispute.Representative Major R. Owens, the Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Education, scheduled a hearing on the dispute Tuesday. The committee has oversight over Gallaudet's requests for money. His office said Mr. Owens favored appointment of a hearing-impaired president for the school, a position by a number of legislative colleagues.There was also further evidence today that the Gallaudet dispute was increasingly becoming the focal point for a national drive to obtain more rights and opportunities for the deaf and hearing-impaired."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/17/nyregion/dancing-to-the-beat-counted-out-in-sign-language.html", "headline": "Dancing to the Beat, Counted Out in Sign Language", "date": "1988-01-17T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 17, 1988, Section WC, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

There was laughing and teasing about what hair styles to wear, and the only thing unusual about the group was that the conversation was in sign language.The eight dancers were eighth- through 12th-grade students at the New York School for the Deaf in White Plains, and they were participating in an afterschool class made possible by grants from the Xerox Corporation - with funds administered by the White Plains-based Dance in Education Fund -Con Edison and Chase/NBW.The class was led by Jane Alexandre, a hearing dance professional, with assistance from Monika Valgame, a deaf dancer, and Shelly Packer, the hearing coordinator of the program - both faculty members of the school. Madeleine Reich, the arts-in-education coordinator of the school, organized the program.Because most of the students could not hear the music at all (although it was played very loudly for the sake of those with some hearing), they watched carefully as their instructors counted the beats in sign language. ''The students have to learn to connect movements with counts'' - with no musical cues - ''and that takes a lot of concentration,'' Ms. Packer said.Ms. Packer, who is expert in sign language, explained that a goal of the program was to make signing a part of the choreography. At the New Rochelle library jazz-dance demonstrations, held in connection with Deaf Heritage Week, the girls signed lyrics to the song ''The Time of Your Life'' from the film ''Dirty Dancing.''''Dance is a form of communication that involves the body, and sign language utilizes the body to the Nth degree,'' Ms. Packer said. ''We're taking their language and turning it into an art.'' Ms. Packer calls this special dance form ''sinography.''Contrary to her expectations, Ms. Alexandre, whose knowledge of sign language is limited to counting and simple words, said she found teaching at the school extremely ''easy and enjoyable.'' (She also teaches at the Humphrey Dance Center in Tarrytown and the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts in Goldens Bridge, and is an artist in residence with the Council for the Arts in Westchester.) ''The deaf communicate through physical movement,'' Ms. Alexandre observed. ''They aren't shy or self-conscious - they'll try absolutely anything. And they don't think about movement before they do it; something mental is left out that they don't need.''Ms. Reich stressed the benefit of having the dance-trained Ms. Valgame as a role model for the students - to show that ''this is not impossible'' -and Ms. Packer emphasized the values of ''commitment, responsibility and dedication'' that are learned from putting on a performance.In addition, Ms. Packer and all concerned stressed, learning to dance is helping these students ''feel good about themselves.'' Ms. Alexandre indicated a dark-haired girl working hard on her routine in the front row. Before beginning dance lessons, this student walked with her head bent down, looking at the floor, Ms. Alexandre noted. ''Dance has changed her,'' she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/03/education/blackboard-notes-sign-language-gets-recognition.html", "headline": "SIGN LANGUAGE GETS RECOGNITION", "date": "1988-01-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 3, 1988, Section 12, Page 4Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The addition of the language of the deaf as an acceptable alternative to the state's requirement that students complete a course in either a foreign language or visual or performing arts will take effect July 1. It will make California the third state in the nation to accept sign language as a graduation credit.California requires only one year of a foreign language, and those familiar with the sign-language course expect that it will be offered as a one-year course that may be taken anywhere between grades 9 and 12.While only a few school districts in the state are expected to immediately begin offering classes in manual communication to people without hearing impairment, integrating sign language into the school curriculum represents a milestone, according to advocates of the deaf community, for those whose handicap is all but invisible.Teaching hearing people sign language would mean that some of the two million hearing-impaired persons in the state would be less isolated and better integrated into the mainstream, said Peggy J. Selover of San Rafael, a legal assistant and an activist for the deaf, who though not deaf herself, helped organize support among the deaf for offering the course, which culminated in the legislative amendment. ''So many doors are closed in the labor force,'' said Ms. Selover, who took a sign-language course 10 years ago and became ''hooked'' on it, in her words. ''It's not that the deaf can't communicate,'' she said. ''It's the hearing people who can't.''If classes prove popular, they could also play a part in solving a shortage of teachers, guidance counselors and mental-health professionals to serve the deaf population, said Robert Lennan, superintendent of the California School for the Deaf in Riverside. The school is one of two such institutions in the state - the other is in Fremont - that enroll about 800 youngsters ages 3 to 21. But most of the 6,000 deaf school-age youngsters in California attend traditional public schools, where translators are needed.Not everyone agrees that offering a sign-language course as an alternative to a foreign language is a good thing. The California Federation of Teachers opposed it, saying sign language is not a comparable discipline. But legislatures in Maine and Michigan have also deemed sign language an acceptable language substitute, and Ohio is considering a similar proposal. Maine, which offered the first sign-language courses for credit in 1985, has two classes totaling 20 students who may take two years of the language. Michigan's courses began in September with about 90 enrollees.One hurdle the states face is to persuade colleges to revise their undergraduate entrance requirements to accept sign language. Such a push is under way in California; Bill Honig, the state's Superintendent of Public Instruction, said in a recent interview, ''I hold some hope it has some weight with university people.'' Boston College, New York University and the University of Southern California, among other institutions, now accept sign language as fulfilling the language requirement for graduate degrees."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/27/nyregion/a-house-thats-home-for-deafblind-adults.html", "headline": "A House That's Home for Deaf-Blind Adults", "date": "1987-12-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "LEAD: IT WAS ''quiet time'' in the attractive ranch house on Lake View Drive here, the first group home in the state for deaf-blind adults.IT WAS ''quiet time'' in the attractive ranch house on Lake View Drive here, the first group home in the state for deaf-blind adults.Opened last year by the New Jersey Association of the Deaf-Blind Inc., the residence houses six deaf-blind, mentally retarded adults ranging in age from 22 to 26.The young adults, called clients by their counselors, relaxed in their large, cheerful living room. They had just returned from either a workshop or an adult training center that they attend weekdays to learn work and living skills and earn a small stipend doing jobs suited to their capabilities.The doorbell rang and they werejoined by two neighborhood children dropping in for a visit. Talking freely and greeting friends in the house, it was obvious that the 10- and 11-year-old visitors had been there before. Both explained they were trying to learn sign language so they could communicate more easily with the home's residents.Neighbors have been especially supportive, according to the group home's manager, Amy Fairchild, who said it was not unusual to have neighborhood friends over for dinner.As the dinner hour neared, the people in the living room dispersed to help with the chores. In the kitchen, they prepared chicken and creamed carrots. In the laundry room, a young woman proudly washed her clothes, having spent several weeks learning to use the washer and dryer.Although the six clients are legally blind and deaf, their handicaps vary in degree. Some have slight vision, the ability to hear certain sounds or understand speech. Others do not.All, however, have severe impairment of both senses, which interferes with their ability to function, and all are handicapped as a result of a rubella (German measles) outbreak in the early 1960's. (Their mothers contracted the disease during the first trimester of pregnancy.) Because of the differences among the residents, the programs provided by counselors are based on individual needs. Annual goals for each client make up the differences.For example, one client's goal was to learn to answer the telephone; another's, to develop meal-preparation skills, learn to set the table and eat and prepare a simple meal.Still another person's goals were to increase her self-help skills, to use appropriate table manners, care for her hair and lose weight. Developing safety awareness and learning to operate kitchen utensils were the goals of a fourth.''We encourage our clients to do as much as they can for themselves,'' Mrs. Fairchild said. ''Like everyone else, these young people are trying to fulfill their potential. I just wish I had as much energy and drive as they use in their efforts to do that.''To identify more clearly with the residents, Mrs. Fairchild said, staff members occasionally blindfold themselves to do simple tasks. Once, she said, they put on blindfolds and tried to make cookies.''Needless to say,'' she added, ''they weren't very good.''The New Jersey Association of the Blind-Deaf Inc. is a nonprofit organization founded in 1978 by a group of parents of deaf-blind children. It works closely with the New Jersey Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired, which helps with financing and programs, and with the state's Division of Developmental Disabilities, which provided the money to buy the house and pays its operating cost.Additional money comes from private donations and fund drives.''Even though the state funds the operational cost,'' said Nancy J. Erickson, executive director of the association, ''there are many extras for which we have to find money.''Establishing a group home is never easy, according to Miss Erickson. After submitting plans and receiving approval from the state's Division of Developmental Disabilities, the association sends letters to the towns in which it is trying to find a house.''We want them to know we're looking,'' Miss Erickson said, ''that we're not attempting to do anything in secret.''Once a house is found, the town is notified.''Then things get a little sticky,'' Miss Erickson said. ''Looking back, it was relatively calm in Spotswood, compared to what has happened before and since then.''Here, people were concerned with parking problems, whether there would be Seeing Eye dogs and what our house would do to their property values. Since we moved in, the neighbors have been wonderful.''In North Brunswick, the town chosen for the association's second home, things did not go as smoothly as in Spotswood. Although the association bought a house there and now has three deaf-blind clients living in it, the township sued and the matter is still in litigation.Mayor Paul Matacera of North Brunswick said in a telephone interview that the town felt the selection practice on group homes had been arbitrary.''North Brunswick already has two other group homes in its boundaries,'' he said. ''We felt we did our share. What we are saying is that we would like to see the rest of the communities in the county [Middlesex] do their share.''The house chosen by the association, Mr. Matacera said, is in a residential neighborhood, and he wonders what contribution such a facility can make to a residential neighborhood.''Our biggest argument is that we should not be the only ones singled out because the association decided that this is where it wants a group home to be,'' he said.Some towns expressing concern about group homes want to be sure there will be adequate supervision.In the home here, 14 full-time counselors, or the equivalent in part-time counselors, supervise the six clients around the clock. None of the counselors lives in the house. The two night counselors stay awake during their shifts.Mrs. Fairchild, who lives 15 minutes away, is called in emergencies and is on hand for special occasions, such as fire drills at 2 A.M.The purchase price of the house here was $120,000, plus $35,000 for renovations. The annual operating budget is $250,000. According to Miss Erickson, the cost of running a group home is one-third less than the cost of institutionalization.Estimates on the number of deaf-blind New Jersey residents range from 2,500 to 5,000, depending on the survey and the criteria used to define deaf-blind, Miss Erickson said. Not all deaf-blind people, she added, are suited to group-home living.In a group home, unlike a large institution, she explained, clients are saturated with attention. Whether a counselor is taking a client to the store to help her choose a ring, or sitting in the sun with another client or accompanying one or more clients to the supermarket, there is time for individualized attention in a home atmosphere, bringing with it the opportunity to become more self-sufficient.Jacqueline O'Neill of East Brunswick is vice president of the Association of the Deaf-Blind and the mother of Eileen, 22, who lives in the Spotswood facility.The association's immediate goal, Mrs. O'Neill said, is to establish a maximum of five group homes.''The need is there,'' she said. ''There are still young people in limbo, not in the right placement.''Mrs. O'Neill said she was especially pleased with the Spotswood home. She must work, she said, and if her daughter were not in the group home, she would probably have to be institutionalized.''I sleep better not having to worry,'' Mrs. O'Neill said. ''I feel confident that Ellen is in the right place, that someone is caring for her in a loving, interested way.''She knows, Mrs. O'Neill said, that there are still people who do not think her daughter is worth educating because they are concerned about the cost.''It may be more costly than educating the average child,'' she said, ''but in the long run, if you educate people to do more for themselves, they will require less attention and fewer caretakers in the future.''The clients are involved in all the aspects of running their home, including cleaning, cooking and shopping, Mrs. Fairchild said.''Although parents work very closely with the home, visit their children and often take them for a short stay with their families,'' she said, ''the young people are very aware that their home is on Lakeview Drive.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/29/us/deaf-writer-asks-questions-that-echo-for-young.html", "headline": "Deaf Writer Asks Questions That Echo for Young", "date": "1987-11-29T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 29, 1987, Section 1, Page 68Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Courteously and with humor, the novelist, Douglas Bullard, tried to answer them all.Mr. Bullard, one of only a few deaf novelists, was asked to talk to some of the 170 students about his current book projects and his first novel, ''Islay,'' which was published last year.''It's a fantasy about a deaf man who takes over a small state,'' the 50-year-old author explained, using sign language. ''He convinces enough deaf people to move to that state where they can become the majority, so they can control their own lives. It's a satire. It's a fun book.''Mr. Bullard disputes the idea that the book's utopic vision is hostile or separatist. But he said he hoped those who can hear and are patronizing toward the deaf would re-examine their attitudes after reading the book. 'The Eternal Question'The publisher, Terrence J. O'Rourke, who is also deaf, says ''Islay'' leads to a better understanding of deaf people. ''The book presents the question that is the eternal question in the world of the deaf,'' Mr. O' Rourke said through a translator in a telephone interview. ''That is, will we be better off running things ourselves rather than by the majority?''The 168-year-old school, situated on an old colonial campus in Germantown, stresses exposure to deaf role models for their students.Experts in the literature of the deaf say Mr. Bullard is the first deaf author to write a novel about the ''deaf experience,'' the lives and aspirations of the closely knit deaf community. It is also the first time that sign language, a visual gestural language that lacks a standard written form, has been used in a novel at any great length.''There have been novels with deaf characters,'' O'Rourke said, ''but never novels about deaf people or the deaf sub-culture or minority. It's the first novel that truly speaks about deaf people.''Dr. Trent Batson, a professor of English at Gallaudet College, a liberal arts college for the deaf in Washington, says ''Islay'' is unique in conveying the social fabric of the deaf world and for getting the sense of American Sign Language into written form. Publisher Was TeacherMr. O'Rourke, who was also a professor of English at Gallaudet in the 1960's, started T. J. Publishers Inc. in Silver Spring, Md., in 1978 by publishing several sign language books he wrote. Over the years, he said, his publishing company has sold about six million copies of these books, his ''bread and butter.'' Last year his company published its first novel, Mr. Bullard's ''Islay.''Mr. O'Rourke describes Mr. Bullard's writing as reminiscent of the late John Kennedy Toole's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ''A Confederacy of Dunces,'' because, ''Like Toole, he has a story full of local color and ludicrous characters.'' Mr. Bullard credits Tom Robbins and Kurt Vonnegut for shaping him as a writer.''They taught me that you don't have to follow any rules,'' Mr. Bullard said. ''What you say doesn't have to fit reality because, in the first place, what is reality? I think they broke through to me. Before, I didn't know what kind of writer I'd be. Those two freed me to be me.'' An Alternative StyleThese liberating forces helped inspire Mr. Bullard to create a new reality in deaf literature. Faced with the inadequacy of standard written English to convey the nuances of sign language, with its special grammar and syntax, Mr. Bullard reached for an alternative style.He chose to combine a variety of methods, using ''glosses,''or English words which represent signs, and ''literal'' and ''free'' translations of sentences. Characters also communicate through teletyped messages. The narrative in ''Islay'' is written through the eyes of its main character, Lyson C. Sulla, a deaf man. The author says the inspiration for the character's name was a can of Lysol.Mr. Bullard grew up in Georgia and Florida with parents and siblings who were not deaf. Although he lost his hearing at the age of 3 from spinal meningitis, he says he had an advantage because he could once hear and his mother used to talk and sing to him as he sat on her lap. ''The circuitry was set up in my head before I became deaf - it would have been harder to write if I had been born deaf,'' he said.The children gathered around the guest's feet gestured in sign language at a furious pace, sometimes interrupting each other in order to get a question in. They wanted to know such fundamental things as when Mr. Bullard liked to write and what he liked to write with.''I like to write in the mornings. I couldn't work on the book all day. '' He writes with a pencil because: ''My mind works at the same speed as my hand does. The typewriter distracts me and the computer is impossible.''''Islay'' took three years to write and his second novel, ''On Deaf Ears,'' which is about to be published by T. J. Publishers, took him nine months. He is working on a third novel."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/15/nyregion/deaf-teacher-sharpens-his-students-sensitivity-to-others.html", "headline": "Deaf Teacher Sharpens His Students' Sensitivity to Others", "date": "1987-11-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "LEAD: RICHARD KOENIGSBERG, a high school humanities teacher here, was checking attendance, calling the names of students who obviously could not hear him above the din.RICHARD KOENIGSBERG, a high school humanities teacher here, was checking attendance, calling the names of students who obviously could not hear him above the din.Noticing that few students, all of them seniors, were responding, he stopped.''I don't talk to hear myself talk,'' Mr. Koenigsberg told the class, ''because I can't hear myself talk. Think about that, please.'' Mr. Koenigsberg is deaf. The class immediately quieted down; attendance was taken and work began.The 38-year-old Mr. Koenigsberg is one-third of a three-instructor team teaching the more than 400 humanities students at East Brunswick High School. It was Friday, the last day of the first week with a new group of students, a week in which Mr. Koenigsberg and his students had discussed the disabled.During the week, he had asked the students to write their names without using their hands, to close their eyes and draw a simple diagram posted on the board and to try to read his lips as he read theirs. 'I don't talk to hear myself talk . . . Think about that.' On this particular morning, he asked for a volunteer. When a student stepped forward, Mr. Koenigsberg seated him in a chair in the center of the room, securely tied his feet and hands and told him he was now paralyzed except for his head.Mr. Koenigsberg then placed a $100 bill on the floor in front of the student.''If you can figure out a way to reach that,'' he told the young man, ''you can have it.''''Wiggle the chair forward,'' someone suggested from the back of the room. ''I can't,'' the student said, ''I'm paralyzed.'' ''I'll make it easier for you,'' Mr. Koenigsberg said, putting the money in the boy's shirt pocket.It soon became apparent that the student could do nothing about the money. Asked about his feelings, he replied that he was upset and frustrated.Mr. Koenigsberg reminded the class that the student's problem was a temporary one, and that what he was feeling in no way compared with the intense feeling of those who were really paralyzed.At the end of the period, Mr. Koenigsberg told the class that on Monday it would have the opportunity to interview him.''Ask any questions you want,'' he said. ''I won't object. You all know that I can't hear, but . . . you'll have the opportunity to ask about things that might be puzzling you, and we will get to know each other better.''Later, Mr. Koenigsberg explained that it was during the first week with his students that he tried to establish a rapport with them.''My goal,'' he said, ''is to relax the class, to relieve the students of the uneasy feeling that people get when they meet someone with a handicap, to give students a better understanding of the disabled and to make them realize the things they take for granted and how fortunate they are.''In humanities, he explained, where art, drama, history and literature are intertwined with the feelings that people have in dealing with each other, and where prejudice, apathy and responsibility are often discussed, the interaction between those who are disabled and those who are not easily fits into the curriculum.According to Dennis Russell, coordinator of deaf education for the state's Department of Education, it is unusual for a deaf teacher to be instructing hearing students.Mr. Koenigsberg ''may not be the only one in the state presently doing it,'' Mr. Russell said, ''but he's the only one I've heard of. It's a credit to the Board of Education who hired him, who could see beyond what he couldn't do to what he could do.''Mr. Russell said it was especially fine that the teacher was so willing to share a part of himself with his students. This may be the only time in their lives that these students have contact with someone who is deaf or disabled, he said.Mr. Koenigsberg was 12 when he began wearing a hearing aid. He became totally deaf after being kicked during a soccer game while a student at Lynchburg College in Virginia. The diagnosis: auditory nerve deafness.Having had no experience with deaf students, Lynchburg officials were not sure that Mr. Koenigsberg should remain at their school. At their suggestion, he visited Gallaudet College in Washington, a school for the deaf. He re-PU JP DEAF called that day:''I got out of the car to ask a student directions to the Administration Building. The student responded in sign language. That might be the answer for some, but I knew it wasn't for me. I returned to Lynchburg.''The real difficulty for Mr. Koenigsberg began in his senior year, when it was time to do his practice teaching. No high school wanted him, and it was not until trying a fifth school that a principal agreed to give him a chance.''I remember telling the principal that I should know whether I could do it in two weeks' time,'' Mr. Koenigsberg said. ''If I couldn't, I promised to walk out by myself.''His student teaching was so successful that he was offered a position in the district the following year. He accepted.Ten years later, Mr. Koenigsberg moved to New Jersey. He taught in Maplewood for three years, finally moving to the East Brunswick school system, from which he had graduated in 1967. Today, one of his colleagues in the humanities program is a teacher he had in high school.During his 17-year teaching experience covering classes from the 6th through 12th grade, Mr. Koenigsberg has taught world history, social science, health and physical education, geography and United States history. In addition, he has served as a baseball and soccer coach.Asked if he ever thought of teaching deaf children, he said:''When I lost my hearing, I said to myself, 'I'm going to have to make it in this world as it is.' I wanted to be the person I always was. I also believe I do a good job here.''It is ironic, Mr. Koenigsberg said, that his sister, Lynda, who is not deaf, teaches in the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf in West Trenton. That is especially so, he added, since she became interested in the deaf as a result of his experience. He often visits the school, he said, to talk with parents there.''My sister,'' Mr. Koenigsberg said, ''tried to teach me sign language once, but I wasn't really interested and so it didn't take. It's very important to remember that it is far more difficult when one is born deaf and has never heard the spoken word, as I have.''Although Mr. Koenigsberg's pronunciation of some words has been somewhat affected by his deafness, he is easily understood.Amy Brown, 17, a student in one of his classes, said that, in the beginning, it might have been necessary to pay a little more attention to catch every word he said.''But paying a little more attention isn't bad, either,'' she said. ''I love the class. It's fun, it's cultural and the teacher makes us feel that he's really interested in us, that he really cares.''He realizes, Mr. Koenigsberg said, that he will always be conscious of his speaking voice, working on it when necessary.''I have a speech therapist with whom I've worked for many years, and we keep in close touch,'' he added.Mr. Koenigsberg, who lives in East Brunswick with his wife, Cynthia, and their 4-year-old son, Jason, had always wanted to be a teacher.''I felt it was a wonderful way to spend one's life,'' he said. ''I couldn't let myself be persuaded to change. I'm happy. I enjoy what I'm doing. How many people can say that?'' According to Dr. Joseph Sweeney, East Brunswick's Superintendent of Schools, the important thing about Mr. Koenigsberg is that he is such a fine teacher.Dr. Sweeney said students went out of their way to tell him that.Dr. Sweeney recalled observing Mr. Koenigsberg as 50 students piled into a darkened amphitheater while waiting for the teacher to show a film.''I was thinking, 'Boy, these kids better settle down,' '' Dr. Sweeney said. ''Just about the time I would have said something to them, the teacher did.''It was amazing. Here's a deaf man in a dark room who has the same perception I had and acted on it as fast as I would.''We like to hire our own students [graduates], of course, but the basic criteria is that they must be competent. Mr. Koenigsberg is a skilled teacher, an intense, conscientious vital man who fits into the humanities team very well.''And from my own observation and conversations with others, he is doing a spectacular job.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/nyregion/long-island-opinion-volunteers-beacons-in-world-of-the-deaf-blind.html", "headline": "VOLUNTEERS: BEACONS IN WORLD OF THE DEAF-BLIND", "date": "1987-10-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 18, 1987, Section LI, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

You are blindfolded and wear padded earmuffs that exclude sound. For all practical purposes, you are blind and deaf. You sit there in utter darkness and stone silence, confident that the promise will be kept, that you will be retrieved in a minute.But when the minute comes and goes, and then another and yet another, the blackness and the stillness gather momentum; they compound. They begin to worry you, even knowing that you can remove the blindfold and the earmuffs at will and be in the sighted, hearing world again. But, even knowing that, you feel deserted, forgotten, alone and isolated from that world. When the friendly hand touches your shoulder, the relief is infinite.This is part of the training you receive when you sign up as a volunteer at the Helen Keller Home for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults at Sands Point. Sands Point is the home of the Helen Keller National Center, which has 10 regional branches across the country.It is equipped with the latest in training devices and an expert, dedicated professional staff. The modern facility is on a 25-acre campus and consists of two buildings: one, the training center itself, and the other, living quarters for some 50 clients.The clients who seek help are deaf-blind, either totally or partly, or will become totally deaf-blind in time. Most of them have trouble speaking as a result of their infirmity. Many have motor dysfunctions as well. All of them have speech problems.The program of instruction is designed to make these deaf-blind people as self-sufficient as possible during their stay at the center, which ranges from about three months to a year and a half. They are taught to communicate, to cope with the demands of everyday living, to learn skills that will make them employable and, generally, to fit into the society into which they are eventually returned.To accomplish these goals, the center counts for help on an ever-growing body of volunteers, in addition to its professional staff. Last year, my wife and I decided to offer our services as part of a project of the Manhasset Kiwanis Club, of which I am a longtime member.Frankly, we did it with trepidation. The very sight of the afflicted was not easy to take at first. At best, it was heart-rending. To see these people moving about the corridors of the center with long canes, bumping into walls, sometimes falling, struggling to find their way in their dark world bothered us at first.So did their high-pitched, unintelligible cries that passed for speech. So did seeing those who suffer from Usher's syndrome whirling about like spinning tops. The thick corrective lenses that look like magnifying glasses made their eyes look huge and pathetic.We had to steel ourselves against our pity. It was only after prolonged contact and growing understanding that we were able to accept their abnormalities and begin to regard them as a ''normal'' part of our new experience.Even though there are volunteers at the center who contribute considerable talent and expertise (such as teaching Braille and other skills), my wife and I are part of the unskilled troops. We do the inevitable stuffing of envelopes for mailings, manning desks at functions, and so on. In direct client involvement, we have done no more than drive deaf-blind clients to nearby food markets on a weekly basis and help them make their food selections.Part of our training was the learning of the tactual manual alphabet (finger spelling), by way of communicating better with our clients. (''Clients'' is such an unfortunate term, given its commercial connotation, I think; ''students'' would be far more appropriate, but clients is how they are referred to.) And even though we had originally mastered it to the best of our abilities, my wife and I found it very difficult to work with effectively: each word has to be spelled out, which is cumbersome.Fortunately, the clients we have worked with so far were partly sighted, with some hearing capacity, and so we've managed to break the communications barrier. We've never returned from the supermarket with fewer than three bags of groceries.Modest work, admittedly, but necessary. Which is why the Helen Keller National Center is always looking for vounteers, both those who can provide skilled services and those who can render the more menial but equally needed work. The objectives are the same in both cases: to provide that friendly, helpful hand that brightens the lives of clients.It works both ways. As volunteers, we derive a great satisfaction from doing our small share. Not only does our volunteer work with the deaf-blind provide us with the occasion to appreciate our sight and hearing, but also it leaves us with a good feeling from being of service to others. If, indeed, we draw our clients out of their world of darkness and stillness briefly, they draw us out of our natural self-centeredness.I wouldn't be surprised if we got more out of our volunteer work than we put into it."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/nyregion/speaking-personally-a-deaf-grandpa-fills-child-s-world.html", "headline": "A DEAF GRANDPA FILLS CHILD'S WORLD", "date": "1987-09-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from September 20, 1987, Section WC, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

My mother's father was my favorite grandparent, an exotic and colorful figure. Alone in the world, living in New York City, and deaf from birth, he was able to understand a child's world with his depth of imagination and limitless kindness.He visited our suburban home frequently. Arriving on the train, he would greet us with quick rough hugs, kisses and grunts of joy. Unable to speak, his low gutteral sounds combined with a night's growth of beard were the first impressions every visit brought.Although he had stayed up through the night (he was a typesetter for Women's Wear Daily), he would invade our living room upon his arrival. Grandpa Paul always brought at least two or three cardboard cartons. Tied with excessive lengths of coarse twine and sporting the wooden handles salvaged from old shopping bags, these boxes were a source of fascination to my sister and me.Cartons were unpacked with great care and deliberation, yielding varieties of wonderfully useful or profoundly useless presents. Useful items included underwear, handkerchiefs, pajamas, ''rompers'' and money. Perhaps a prosaic lot, but from Grandpa Paul, they were wild and wonderful.Underwear was always in colors, not the white that parents purchased, but pastels, prints, and polka dots. Hankies sported everything from autum leaves to red roses and might even be trimmed in lace. Pajamas could be mistaken for clown suits or they were ''shorty'' sets of soft crinkly cotton knit, never of the subdued, button-down-the-front flannel variety. Rompers were a summer item, a loosely fitting one-piece outfit to be worn on the hottest days, sometimes in lieu of a bathing suit.And the money was a pharmacist's pill vial filled with quarters, nickels, or dimes depending on the circumference of the tube. Coins were chosen for their purity and shine; my grandfather disdained the use of anything but the pure element in his search for coins for his granddaughters. Vintage silver dollars were offered as special treats, not to be spent, but to be carefully saved or worn as pendants.The second wave of gifts further revealed Grandpa Paul's understanding and involvement in children's delight in fantasy and imagination. These presents must have been the product of hours of evaluating the offerings of stores and street vendors in his neighborhood. On many occasions, the toys met one or two criteria: were they wonderful to behold or did they make a great noise?The visual delights included the small sushi-like wafers of material that, when placed in water, became floating flower gardens. Little dolls were also in this group. Our favorite was a ceramic cutesy we named ''Pottery,'' out of fascination with her material origins. Even after she met her demise on the cold tiles of the bathroom floor, Pottery was long remembered as a favorite among the dolls.Fireworks were another of the visual treats Grandpa Paul chose. When these dangerous, illegal offerings were swiftly consigned to a bucket of water by a wary father, my sister and I half expected them to turn into the largest and most spectacular of the floating gardens!Slinkies, ''clicker-clackers,'' coin ladders, and small wooden magic tricks headed the list of items that might be both noisy and fun to watch. We never tired of their repetitive rhythms; the slinky as it descended a short flight of wooden steps; the ''clicker-clacker,'' as it flipped through its vertical routine; and the coin as it descended its series of end-on-end plastic ladders. The trick that hid and then revealed a coin was perfect for girls who had just received the equivalent of two rolls of quarters.Small metal cash registers, with keys that could be pounded in simulation of a piano, were also filled with those shiny coins. All of these gifts were given in exact duplicate as my sister and I, very close in age, were raised almost as twins.Grandpa Paul then delighted in watching us play with the toys, count the money and model the pajamas. He observed our activities as one would bird-watch, quietly, without comment. Sometimes we would turn the pages of a picture book as he would look on. Perhaps we would sit at our desks and do school work or play school. No matter, he just enjoyed seeing us do whatever we had in mind. And, as he made no comment and offered no criticism, we unselfconsciously followed our customary routine.Grandpa Paul's visits were a party. My mother prepared large festive meals with rich, calorie-laden desserts. We all watched in awe as this slender, wiry man devoured first, second and sometimes third helpings, all washed down with quantities of ice water. We wondered that he ever had room for an equally oversized dessert and laughed when he held up his hand so that we would pour him only half a cup of black coffee.The sad part of the visits involved my parents' conflict with this little old man who tried so hard to please. He invaded their quiet routine and their privacy with his need to be involved, active and productive. He brought old clothes to store at the house, perhaps hand-me-downs from his successful brothers, a lawyer and an accountant. My mother reluctantly gave closet space to these outdated items that he may have used to stake his claim in our territory.He insisted on hanging the wash on an old umbrella-style clothesline in the backyard, an innocent enough task, except that he would wear the briefest of swim shorts into the yard so that he could get maximum exposure to the sun. This offended my parents as they were trying to raise modest young daughters. Grandpa Paul also loved to sweep. He would target the garage and cellar for this chore. Raising huge clouds of cement dust, my father would complain of a clogged nose and Grandpa Paul would once again be in trouble.He also angered my father with papers he would bring. The ensuing arguments frightened us in their ferocity: my father would shout and sign his opinions; my grandfather used sign and mime to express his disagreement.These papers had no meaning for two little girls, but we later discovered that they involved loans for which Grandpa Paul had co-signed. His foreman threatened him with the loss of his job unless he affixed his good name to such agreements. As a deaf person, in the early part of this century, he had little recourse but to take the word of his boss.In many ways he had made a success of himself in that world. He worked a good and steady job, he maintained ties with his family and he gave of himself as much as he could. He had been a poor boy from an impoverished family. They sent him to a residential, military school for the deaf that taught only sign language, the manual alphabet and a suitable trade. He was never encouraged to speak or to read lips. He spoke with his hands, his expressions and his offerings of gifts and money. He communicated with his grandchildren by enjoying through them the youth he had been deprived of.The saddest part of Grandpa's visits were his departures. I would watch for the signs - my mother would assemble all of the leftovers from the feasts and begin to make sandwiches, to wrap slices of cake, and to brew coffee to fill his thermos. It was always in the evening, as Granpa Paul would be on his way to work the night shift. The darkness made it sadder still. We would pile into the car, ride to the train station, feel the same quick rough hugs and kisses. The whistle would blow and Grandpa Paul would board the train. We would all wave goodbye and begin to cry."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/17/opinion/listen-to-the-needs-of-deaf-children.html", "headline": "Listen to the Needs of Deaf Children", "date": "1987-07-17T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 17, 1987, Section A, Page 35Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Those recommendations must be submitted to Congress and the President by February. The commission should listen to the deaf community and recommend the revitalizing of residential schools for the deaf.The Congressional Commission on the Education of the Deaf, having held hearings in five cities and with expert testimony planned later this summer, hopes to issue final recommendations later this year. Those recommendations must be submitted to Congress and the President by February. The commission should listen to the deaf community and recommend the revitalizing of residential schools for the deaf.The commission visited an educational disaster. The average 12th grade deaf student reads at a fourth grade level and does arithmetic (his best subject) at a sixth grade level. Thus most deaf students leave school unable to read newspapers and are grossly unprepared for our technological society.It is no surprise that deaf children do badly in school. Their instruction is conducted in spoken and written English although 8 out of 10 of them became deaf before they could learn English at home.These children lack the knowledge of English and the skills of articulation and lip reading required to succeed. Studies have shown that teachers of the deaf find two-thirds of their own deaf pupils hard to understand or utterly unintelligible, and deaf high school students can lip read no better than the man in the street - that is, scarcely at all.To remedy this appalling situation, many leaders in the deaf community want to reform the residential schools for deaf children and to reintroduce sign language and deaf teachers in classrooms. These were successful practices in the 19th century, when deaf children studied all their subjects in their most fluent language, the American Sign Language of the Deaf.In a school with a ''signing'' community, the student is able not only to understand and respond to the instruction but also to get help after class with course work, to discuss local, national and international events, to participate in student activities, to develop friendships with other deaf students, to emulate older students and deaf teachers and to acquire self-respect as a deaf person.The profession of special education, which has largely locked out deaf adults, strongly disagrees with leaders of the deaf community about how to reform education of the deaf.The profession favors the integration of deaf children with hearing children in neighborhood public schools, and has used the 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act to ''mainstream'' some two-thirds of the 80,000 deaf schoolchildren in the United States.The profession considers that the deaf child isolated in a hearing classroom has been placed in a ''less restrictive environment'' - the goal of the act - than the one who participates in the intellectual and social life of a deaf school.Congress was wiser, recognizing as the Supreme Court put it, in a case brought by a parent of a deaf child, that ''regular classrooms simply would not be a suitable setting for the education of many handicapped children.'' Congress provided for alternative placements, but educators largely ignored this provision of the law.Poor conditions in local public schools for the social and emotional growth of deaf children are not offset by enhanced conditions for learning. The first report cards on mainstreamed deaf children show no improvement in English or mathematics attributable to mainstreaming (even though the first children mainstreamed had the best speech and hearing).The deaf children who do best in school are the fortunate 10 percent who learned sign language as a native language from their deaf parents. They outperform their deaf classmates from hearing homes in most subjects, even in learning to read and write English. They are also better adjusted, better socialized and have more positive attitudes.The superior performance of deaf children of deaf parents highlights the changes that most need to be made in the education of deaf children - a return to sign language, deaf teachers and deaf administrators. These changes have long been advocated by many in the deaf community itself.A 1986 report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on the education of the deaf concludes that deaf adults can play an important role ''in the development and education of deaf children,'' and finds that the interaction of deaf adults with deaf children, their parents and teachers also ''enriches the socialization of the deaf child.''Unesco concludes: ''We must recognize the legitimacy of sign language as a linguistic system and it should be accorded the same status as other languages. . . . Now that the importance of the national sign languages for deaf education is better understood, it is no longer admissible to overlook them or to fail to encourage their integration into deaf education. The old idea that the use of sign language interferes with the acquisition of spoken and written language is no longer considered valid.''If deaf adults and their manual language were again substantially involved in the education of deaf children, there would be role models for those children, English language skills would take their appropriate priority, literacy would improve and schools would no longer be unsuccessful speech clinics but rather productive educational institutions."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/22/nyregion/tutors-aid-the-deaf-in-literacy.html", "headline": "TUTORS AID THE DEAF IN LITERACY", "date": "1987-03-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "AT A recent session here of a literacy project for deaf adults, Joseph Linfante of East Brunswick, a volunteer tutor, used sign language, finger spelling and lip movements to read a job memorandum that Carlos Ortiz of Somerset had received from his employer.With help from Mr. Linfante, who has been deaf since childhood, and other tutors in the project at the New Brunswick Adult Learning Center, the 23-year-old Mr. Ortiz improved his vocabulary and reading skills and went on to pass the written and driving tests for a driver's license.A few months later, accompanied by a tutor-interpreter from the project - called Enable (for Expanding New Brunswick's Adult Basic Literacy Efforts) - Mr. Ortiz was interviewed and accepted for a part-time job at Rutgers University. He recently was promoted to full time.''I study reading every day,'' Mr. Ortiz signed, which was translated into spoken English. ''Now I have more responsibility as a full-time groundskeeper at Rutgers. I'm happy with that. I'm a good worker.''Mr. Linfante recently retired from an electrical concern after working at a variety of jobs for 44 years. He signed that he remembered the complexities that faced him when learning to read and write, and that he had become a tutor to encourage other deaf people ''to learn more and not give up'' so that they could move up in their jobs.Enable is co-sponsored by the New Brunswick Board of Education's Adult Learning Center and the New Brunswick Public Library. Participants meet from 6 to 8:30 P.M. Monday and Tuesday at the Learning Center, 259 George Street.A small team of volunteers and staff members provides individual tutoring to 30 deaf adults enrolled in the project, which is financed by a $9,000 grant from the state's Department of Education.Ellen Ball Nalven, a center staff member and an educator for the deaf, is the project's director. Darlene Sarnouski of Rahway, a 27-year-old deaf college graduate, is her full-time aide.In addition to conducting the project, the women are redesigning and adapting tutor-training instruction materials from the Literacy Volunteers of America, a national agency, to the needs of a deaf literacy program.Their goal is to train tutors more effectively for the complex challenge of teaching reading to deaf adults so that they can move on to the center's eight other programs, such as basic skills for a high school diploma.''Like many of the center's 500 adult students, mostly school dropouts, deaf students can see the progress of others in the midst of difficult academic work,'' said Judith E. Kesin, the center's director.''Normally shy and isolated, deaf adults also have opportunities here to mingle socially with students who aren't physically handicapped and who are from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.''Ms. Nalven said there was a waiting list of deaf students for the project, as well as an urgent need to recruit tutors familiar with sign language or who had taken two sign-language courses.She said that individuals seeking to improve their sign-language skills so that they could become professional interpreters could benefit from tutoring. Interpreter-training interns from nearby colleges are project tutors, Ms. Nalven said.''Deaf people can do anything - the same as people who can hear,'' Mrs. Sarnouski signed. ''They can drive, talk on the telephone and watch television. I notice that deaf students here feel comfortable with tutors like Mr. Linfante and me because we are deaf, too.''Students in the project learn to use special devices, such as television decoders and telecommunication telephones. The latter is a typewriter with a phone receiver and acoustical coupler for users to type messages for communication.Ms. Nalven said that students might understand how to give a sentence in sign language, but frequently could not comprehend what they had signed. For example, she said, a deaf person would sign, ''I went to the store today,'' but that it translates into spoken English as ''store go past me today.''The challenge to read English was threefold for 28-year-old Delfim Fragueiro, who moved from Portugal to Elizabeth four years ago.With help from Ms. Nalven and Anibal Gonzalez of New Brunswick, a fellow student who signs Spanish, Mr. Fragueiro, who signs Portuguese, learned to translate some reading lessons in English into the American Sign Language, enough to get a job as a Zip-code sorter in the Jersey City Post Office.''I feel lucky that I came here [ to Enable ] ,'' Mr. Fragueiro signed. ''I like learning to write English. I'm not very skilled, not yet, but I practice and I will be smart in the future.''For information on enrolling in the project, call (201) 846-2968. MONTCLAIROrganizers of Essex County literacy projects say that a growing public awareness of New Jersey's 700,000 functionally illiterate adults has prompted a demand for reading programs here and in other suburban communities.The number of functionally illiterate adults in the state and country -a total of 27 million - was estimated by the Federal Bureau of the Census in its 1982-83 ''Survey of English Language Proficiency.''With Federal grants of about $25,000 each, the public libraries here and in Irvington have begun weekly one-to-one volunteer tutoring programs for adults and have set up resource centers to provide materials for tutors and students and for tutor-training sites.Michael L. Connell, director of the library here, said that volunteer tutor response had been good in Montclair, a city of 38,000. The problem, he said, ''is to identify those individuals who need help and to recruit them.''Lori McConnell, director of the Irvington Library's Reference Department and the library's literacy director, said that ''many very highly motivated individuals with few reading skills'' had enrolled there.''This town of 60,000 people, with low education levels among adults, is economically poor, has inner city-type neighborhoods with minority populations and problems similar to those of adjacent Newark,'' she said.Ms. McConnell said that the project would soon train more tutors for an increasing number of local students and people from Newark, East Orange and other nearby communities.Frances M. Spinelli, associate director for the Center of Continuing Education at Montclair State College, and Enrico Prata, director of continuing education for the Caldwell-West Caldwell Board of Education, are coordinators of the surburban Essex County literacy effort, which began last month at the Harrison School in West Caldwell.Ms. Spinelli said that the project, financed by an $8,000 grant from the state's Department of Education, would seek to cooperate with county agencies, colleges, businesses, libraries and church groups to provide a resource center in a Caldwell public school to recruit and train volunteer tutors. She said it would try to match tutors and students from different suburbs.''There is not an equal distribution of tutors and students in individual literacy programs in Essex suburbs,'' Ms. Spinelli said. ''In East Orange, there's a great need for tutors, and here at the college there are more tutors than learners.''In Newark since last October, membership in the Literacy Campaign, a nonprofit project, has increased from 65 to 85 community organizations and businesses. It provides three literacy sites for children and three for adults.To contact the literacy programs, call the Montclair Public Library at (201) 744-0500, the Irvington Public Library at (201) 372-6400, the suburban Essex County literacy effort at (201) 228-2092 or the Newark Literacy Campaign at (201) 623-4001."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/us/deaf-woman-files-suit-on-her-jury-dismissal.html", "headline": "Deaf Woman Files Suit On Her Jury Dismissal", "date": "1987-02-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 15, 1987, Section 1, Page 36Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Donna Hunt, a staff assistant, relayed Miss Elion's order and credit-card information to a local florist.With three so-called TTY machines, the Office for the Disabled has provided this relay service for the deaf during business hours over the last nine years. Starting Jan. 27, the service was expanded with the aid of volunteers to three nights a week and on Sundays. At the same time, the county announced a new program aimed at helping those who have experienced a significant loss of hearing.''People who are hard of hearing often isolate themselves from some of life's most pleasurable experiences,'' said County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke. ''Our goal is to let them know that they need not give up movies, television, theater or a concert just because they are hearing-impaired.''The TTY relay program now receives ''a third of the 1,500 calls a month we receive from the community,'' according to Richard Manley, director of the Office for the Disabled. This number has tripled over the last few years, Mr. Manley added. One reason cited for this increase is the more widespread use of TTY machines among the deaf as the cost of the machines declined to less than $200 from about $600 each.''What we do is to provide a conduit between deaf people and the outside world,'' Mr. Manley said. ''We are there when they need to call a doctor or their child's school. We try to limit each person to either three requested calls at a time or 15 minutes for one call. But some calls will be more involved, especially if they are of a medical nature.''Mrs. Hunt has relayed messages for three-and-a-half years. Her calls have ranged from setting up doctor's and racquetball appointments to delivering a love message from a woman to her fiance. Because so much of the information is of a medical or financial nature, all calls are kept strictly confidential. Mrs. Hunt said she hoped that the expanded hours would eliminate some of the frustrations many deaf people now face.''Big areas of concern involve matters where you often can't reach people until after 6 o'clock - such as finding a house or buying a car,'' Mrs. Hunt said. ''From my own experience, I know that there is a tremendous need for this service at night and on weekends.''The expanded services will be available from 5 to 9 P.M. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Sundays. A staff of six volunteers will work in shifts of two at the Westchester County Medical Center during those hours.The two TTY machines that will be used at the Medical Center have been donated by the Bronxville Helen Keller Lion's Club. This organization has been active in helping those with hearing disabilities over the last two years, according to Bud Malfetano, charter president of the club. ''The mere fact that our Lion's Club is named after a woman who did so much to help people with hearing and sight disabilities is a great incentive for us to get involved.''But while approving of the county effort, some advocates for the deaf are demanding 24-hour-a-day relay service to be provided by the telephone company. The State Public Service Commission is holding hearings around the state this month on a proposed rule to provide this service on a statewide basis.''The most important thing is not just for the deaf to have the machines, but to have a place to call 24 hours a day,'' said Taras B. Denis, consultant to the headmaster of the New York School for the Deaf. Mr. Denis, who is deaf himself, added during an interview with the help of an interpreter that ''in the past I couldn't even call the fire department during an emergency.''''If I needed anything at all, I'd have to go across the street to my neighbors and that can be both embarrassing and frustrating,'' he said.With growing awareness of the problem, as depicted by the press and in popular plays such as ''Children of a Lesser God,'' more businesses and even public officials are requesting TTY machines to serve their clients and constituents.After contacting Mr. Denis last year, County Legislator Paul J. Feiner, Democrat of Greenburgh, became the first county elective official to install a machine in his office, offering to help deaf people throughout the county. ''It's a matter of equal rights that deaf people should be entitled to the same degree of services as the nondeaf.''The county is also expanding its efforts to help people who are not completely deaf, but who have some hearing deficiency. Edith R. Shapiro, an Ossining resident and manager of education programs for International Business Machines, will temporarily work for the county as part of I.B.M.'s Corporate Executive Loan Program. Mrs. Shapiro will put together a brochure listing services and listening devices available in the county.''Many people who would benefit from this information are older people who don't know where to go to get help, so they simply stop going out to movies or the theater,'' Mr. Manley said. ''But there's a wide array of technology and resources available to help them today and we want to give them the opportunity to try out these resources.''For Miss Elion, the relay service has made a world of difference in her life. ''This service is a lifesaver for folks like me who want a modicum of independence.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/03/us/deaf-man-jailed-without-counsel.html", "headline": "DEAF MAN JAILED WITHOUT COUNSEL", "date": "1987-01-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 3, 1987, Section 1, Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Mr. Marvin said he learned of Mr. Halcomb's case ''purely by accident'' from another prisoner.''He could have been in there forever,'' Mr. Marvin said.''There are safeguards and procedures built into the system to prevent this kind of thing from happening,'' he said. ''In this case, they were totally ignored.'' Mother Feared Her SonJudge Meyerson said he ordered Mr. Halcomb jailed because the defendant's mother, Ethel Halcomb, said she and her family feared the 290-pound man when he was drunk. She also said alcoholism counselors had recommended confinement.Mr. Halcomb was never represented by a lawyer. In addition, he was not provided with a sign language interpreter when he pleaded not guilty to a charge of disorderly intoxication July 7.''Everybody should be represented by an attorney,'' Judge Meyerson said. ''In this particular case, his mother, who he lived with, was with him.''The case began May 10 when the manager of a doughnut shop complained of an unruly customer. Mr. Halcomb was charged with disorderly intoxication, a charge that carries a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail.Judge Meyerson ordered him to participate in an alcohol and drug abuse program, but his mother said he quit after a couple of sessions.On Sept. 5, Edward Cooke, supervisor of Dade County's alcohol and drug abuse program, asked Judge Meyerson to sentence Mr. Halcomb to treatment.The judge sent Mr. Halcomb to jail Nov. 13, saying that the indefinite sentence was treatment rather than punishment.When an administrative judge signed the release, he ordered Mr. Halcomb to appear before Judge Meyerson next week. A lawyer will accompany him."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/nyregion/school-for-the-deaf-has-dance-preview.html", "headline": "SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF HAS DANCE PREVIEW", "date": "1986-12-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 14, 1986, Section 11WC, Page 35Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Alexandra, who is hearing impaired and lip-reads with the assistance of hearing aids, was meeting one recent morning with a group of students at the New York School for the Deaf, in White Plains.The meeting was in preparation for the students' trip to see a school performance of the ballet, which is being presented by the Westchester County Historical Society at the Academic Arts Theater of Westchester Community College from Tuesday through Thursday, with two public performances on Saturday.Alexandra's visit with about 45 students in grades five through eight came about as the result of talks between Madeline Reich, chairman of enrichment at the School for the Deaf, and Kathy Grantham, a member of the historical society's executive board and chairman for the ballet, which reflects Colonial history.''We wanted to take our students to see 'A Colonial Nutcracker,' '' Mrs. Reich said. ''We contacted the dance company and they told us that Alexandra is a hearing-impaired teen-ager. When I spoke with Kathy Grantham I said how wonderful it would be if we could get Alexandra to come to our school because she shares a lot of the same experiences that our students share.''Mrs. Reich explained that the students at the School for the Deaf, which serves both day and residential students from infancy to 21 years old, are all ''profoundly deaf,'' with an 85-decibel loss or greater. ''They don't hear what you and I hear,'' she explained, ''but with hearing aids, a lot of them do pick up vibration, they do pick up sound.''The students' meeting is only one example of a broad-based effort, started by the school about one-and-a-half years ago, to expose the students to the arts.''The administration made a commitment to bring art into the school,'' Mrs. Reich said. ''We work on a budget that is financed by our board of trustees, the Westchester Council for the Arts and private donations -and the program gives our students the opportunity to experience and experiment with a wide variety of activity that was not provided in the regular curriculum.''Despite the fact that the students' ''mental capabilities are the same as their hearing counterparts,'' she noted, many people have the mistaken notion that the children ''can't do something because they're deaf or they can't enjoy something because they're deaf. The fact of the matter is it's not true.''The enrichment programs are designed to expose the students to a wide range of disciplines. ''We now are running a dance program here that's being taught by a professional dance studio in Tarrytown,'' she said, adding that last year, senior students staged a play under the direction of Charles Katz, a deaf director, that was based on the life of Laurent Clerc, the father of sign language in the United States.Participants from other disciplines have included mimes, a sculptor and a magician - all part of an artists-in-residence program.Not all of the artists are hearing-impaired. ''What we try to do is get a broad base of both hearing and hearing-impaired artists,'' Mrs. Reich said. ''There's no point in showing them that only hearing people do this, but many deaf artists are also successful, and there are many, many deaf artists.''The students prepared for Alexandra's visit under the supervision of their teachers. ''One of the things that we were looking for was for the students to come up with questions for Alexandra,'' Mrs. Reich said. Topics discussed beforehand included questions about her schooling, her deafness and family as well as those concerning dancing with a hearing impairment.''It's really more of a 'rap' session, for kids to look at her and to say this is a great role model,'' Mrs. Reich said. ''To be able to see somebody like that face to face is probably one of the best experiences they can have.''The students were already seated when Alexandra arrived at Stelle Auditorium, on the sprawling 77-acre campus. Mrs. Reich introduced her to the students, speaking and using sign language simultaneously. Because Alexandra, a student at Walter Panas High School in Peekskill, does not understand sign language, Suzanne Terrio, a high school teacher at the school, stood nearby on the stage, serving as an interpreter for Alexandra and the students. When Alexandra spoke, for example, Mrs. Terrio would sign-interpret for the audience - alternating from sign language to spoken English as the students and Alexandra conversed.Hesitant at first, Alexandra introduced herself to the audience, briefly discussing her background, her family and school life. ''I feel weird right now - you guys are signing and I don't know how to deal with it!'' she exclaimed at one point.''Maybe you can start taking questions - that will help you feel more relaxed,'' Mrs. Terrio gently suggested, pointing to a young boy who asked whether she requires an assistant or interpreter at school.''No, I read lips. I manage on my own,'' she answered.The children's obvious interest served to break the ice, and Alexandra's sense of humor began to show through. They exchanged questions and answers, stopping only long enough for Mrs. Terrior to interpret.Many of the questions centered around her dancing. ''How do you follow the music when you're dancing?'' a young boy asked.''I feel the vibrations - I can feel the beat - but it's not easy,'' she answered, explaining how her teacher ''walks through'' the dance with her. ''I watch the steps mostly - very carefully.''Another boy questioned how she feels when audiences watch her.''Like I feel now - nervous. But you have to get used to it,'' she said as the children laughed.Responding to other questions, she explained that she had begun dancing at the age of 5, after having attended a dance performance with her mother. ''It gave me the feeling I had to do it myself,'' she said.And when asked how she enjoyed ''The Nutcracker,'' she responded: ''It's fun. It makes you feel like Christmas already. It's magical.''Much of the discussion was serious, and Alexandra spoke of how, when she was younger, children would sometimes make fun of her. ''If they don't know much about that person, they're afraid of that person,'' she said, explaining how she would ''try to talk to them and tell them about my hearing problem, and they'd understand and we'd become friends. That's what I tried to do, and it worked.''At other times the audience broke into laughter as she described how she tried to keep up with friends' conversations - especially ''when they talk too fast and they're chewing gum'' - and her occasional reluctance to wear her hearing aids. ''Sometimes I take them out when I talk to guys. I don't understand what they're saying, but they keep talking and talking,'' she joked.When the hour ended, the children were reluctant to leave and they surrounded Alexandra, introducing themselves and shaking her hand. ''I hope I can come back again,'' she told them.''I think it will better enhance the experience when they see her perform,'' Mrs. Reich said. ''It put a whole different perspective on it rather than going to a performance and telling them there's a hearing-impaired dancer. There's a camaraderie here now that wasn't here before - and a role model. She's an incredible 15-year-old role model.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/arts/the-deaf-are-divided-on-the-film-lesser-god.html", "headline": "THE DEAF ARE DIVIDED ON THE FILM ''LESSER GOD''", "date": "1986-11-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 16, 1986, Section 1, Page 72Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The deaf have some things to say about it.In fact, the love story about a deaf woman's struggle to communicate with a hearing man has been the subject of debate in the deaf community since the film's release last month.Some scoff at the film's happy ending; others say the lovers can indeed bridge their worlds of silence and sound. There are those who think the characters in the movie are believable and those who say they are not.Most deaf viewers agree that ''Children of a Lesser God'' is a film strictly for the hearing; nevertheless, they regard it as a breakthrough, in view of the fact that it is the first major motion picture about deafness in almost 25 years.''Deaf people are like hearing people - they all have different opinions about the movie,'' said Kevin Nolan, a guidance counselor at the Clark School for the Deaf in Massachusetts.'So Many Misconceptions' ''But the movie is still a very important work for the deaf because it educates the hearing,'' Mr. Nolan said. ''Hearing people still have so many misconceptions - like deaf people can't read or dance or cry or laugh. The movie shows that we have the same worries and feelings, abilitites and aspirations as anyone else.''In ''Children of a Lesser God,'' Sarah Norman, played by a deaf actress, Marlee Matlin, is a bright and beautiful deaf woman who falls in love with James Leeds (William Hurt), a teacher who works in a school for the deaf where Sarah is a cleaning woman.Both characters have strong wills and their own ideas about how they should communicate. James thinks Sarah should learn, as many deaf people do, how to speak. Sarah, who uses sign language, does not want to learn to talk or read lips.Throughout the movie, Mr. Hurt speaks his own lines and repeats aloud what Ms. Norman is signing.Some Do Not Sign A hearing viewer might think that such signing is a clever device to allow the deaf audience to follow the plot. The camera, however, does not always catch the signing. There also are scenes in which characters who talk do not sign.''The movie without subtitles would be very difficult for a deaf person to understand,'' said Joy Ann Hershkowitz, a teacher at Saint Francis de Sales School for the Deaf in Brooklyn.''Mr. Hurt is a pretty good signer, but he often has his back to the camera,'' Mrs. Hershkowitz said. ''Ms. Matlin is angry, so she signs very quickly - and she is hard for even me to understand.''Last Sunday, Mrs. Hershkowitz, who is deaf, went with her husband and her father-in-law, who also are deaf, from their home in Long Island to Manhattan to see a special version of the film with subtitles. What irks them and many other deaf people is the scarcity of such subtitled versions for the country's 20 million hearing-impaired people.Seeming Lack of Concern Of the 215 theaters in the country that are showing ''Children of a Lesser God,'' only 10 have subtitled versions, which play only once a week, on Saturday or Sunday morning. For many deaf people, this is another example of the lack of concern for them.''I understand that hearing people find subtitles distracting, but a lot of deaf people work during the day,'' said Merv Garretson, the assistant to the president at Gallaudet University for the Deaf in Washington. ''At least they could have one showing for the deaf in the evening.''A spokesman for Paramount Pictures said the company had not meant to exclude the deaf, but that few subtitled prints had been made because they were expensive and the company was not sure how the hearing viewers would respond to having words like ''Telephone rings'' at the bottom of the screen.''There is also a question of dealing with a market we know little about,'' said Barry London, the head of distribution and marketing for Paramount. ''We are really blazing new territory here with a movie about deafness.''The last major motion picture about deafness was the 1962 Academy-award winning film ''The Miracle Worker,'' starring Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke.The dearth of such films seems to make deaf people believe they have a vested interest in ''Children of a Lesser God.'' Most agree that a hearing person can learn about the deaf from the movie.''Deafness is the most crippling of all handicaps because it strikes at the very roots of communication,'' said David Davis, a senior at Harvard who was born profoundly deaf. ''I like to think the film is about opening up those lines of communication.''Obviously, this is a movie for the hearing that was financed by a major studio that wants to make money,'' Mr. Davis said, ''but the more exposure people have to the deafness on the screen, the sooner the worlds of the deaf and the hearing are going to be able to understand each other.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/nyregion/inside-images-of-the-deaf-and-blind.html", "headline": "INSIDE IMAGES OF THE DEAF AND BLIND", "date": "1986-10-19T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 19, 1986, Section 11LI, Page 9Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Eventually it will tour Long Island and the Northeast.''I didn't quite know what to expect,'' Mr. Roberts recently recalled of his visit to the center. ''I was afraid they'd all be depressing and strange and that I'd be unable to communicate with them - establish enough rapport to cut through and find their essence. I guess most people without disabilities have comparable misconceptions about the disabled.''Using palm printing, tactual gestures, tadoma - a method by which the deaf and blind ''read'' by touching the lips and throat - and, when all else failed, an interpreter, the photographer managed to ''explain what was going on and create the right environment for something to happen.''It was important to me that each client trust me and understand what the photographic process was about,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in Stamford, Conn. ''So I had them touch the camera and the strobe umbrella and I'd set off the flash so they could feel the heat.''His studio, an empty office at the center, had a stark white background that was meant to suggest inwardness and isolation. It also enabled the photographer to examine his subjects in penetrating detail, eventually compelling the viewer of the finished product, he said, ''to forget that the portraits are only two-dimensional -making them feel confronted by a real individual.''He shot more than 2,000 frames for the series and finally selected 20 to exhibit. But in a way, he conceded, the results are contradictory. Philosophically, the pictures were meant to show the rest of the world that, save for their disabilities, deaf and blind individuals are like other people. However, some of the subjects ''were angry and frustrated, some resigned and some actually happy,'' he said -which made them unique portrait subjects.''There's a sense of patience in all the portraits that you don't normally see,'' he said. ''Sighted-hearing people usually are impatient and fidget. But these people, with their movement limited and the way they hold themselves, they are really there; not just sitting there, but there. They were there for that moment, and their inwardness comes through. I don't think they look like anybody else - at least I hope I captured their uniqueness and diversity.''Mr. Roberts will give a gallery talk on his work Tuesday at 8 P.M. at the library, at 245 Main Street in Port Washington. On Wednesday at 7:30 P.M. ''A World at His Fingertips,'' the documentary on which he worked, will be screened.

But last week she ''heard'' the show - the plaintive love songs, the taunting of the warring street gangs - for the first time at a Candlewood Playhouse production that was interpreted for the deaf.''Oh, what a difference it makes,'' Mrs. Silvestri said during an intermission. ''I'm enjoying it so much.''This is the first season the playhouse in New Fairfield has offered interpreted performances, one during each show's two or three week run. The Danbury Council for the Hearing Impaired, a private, nonprofit organization, is paying for the interpreters, a project that is costing about $3,000 for the six-show season.Money is being raised through contributions from area service groups, among them the Danbury Rotary Club and the Newtown Lions Club.''We are really pleased to be doing this,'' said Frederick J. Berning, a spokesman for the summer theater. ''It's great to see people who otherwise wouldn't attend live theater following along and enjoying it.''Candlewood may be the only Connecticut summer theater that is offering interpreted performances, said the coordinator of interpreting services for the State Commission on the Deaf and Hearing Impaired, Gary Scharff. Other theaters in the state, including the Long Wharf and the Yale Repertory in New Haven and the Hartman in Stamford have had interpreters at certain performances during their regular winter season.The commission has about 35 certified interpreters that it can provide on a part-time basis. About six of them are experienced in theatrical interpreting. Interpreters are used in a variety of settings, from courtrooms to hospitals, college classrooms and summer camps. They use the American Sign Language, a form of manual communication by which objects, ideas and feelings are represented by a series of hand signals.Theatrical interpreting, especially of musicals, is difficult, Mr. Scharff said, because there are usually several charcters on stage at once all the time and the rapid pace. Two interpreters are usually necessary at theatrical performances because much of what is spoken on stage is between two characters.During a recent performance of ''West Side Story,'' Debbie Bonacci and Suzanne Tellio interpeted the show from their position at stage right, just in front of the proscenium.Dressed in black, their faces rouged and lipsticked and illuminated by a spotlight, they used a flurry of hand gestures to express the tension between the Jets and the Sharks and the poignancy of Tony's and Maria's doomed romance. At one point, Mrs. Tellio, her face soft and eyes sparkling, interpreted the lyrics as Maria sang ''I Feel Pretty.'' Within seconds, her features hardened. Scowling, her fists punching the air, she was now one of the Sharks.''It's exhausting,'' said Mrs. Tellio, a 30-year-old Ridgefield resident, ''but it's very rewarding and incredibly energizing.''The interpreters never go into a performance cold, Mrs. Bonacci said. Scripts, scores and, ideally, a tape of the show are provided to them at least a week in advance so they can memorize the songs and as much of the dialogue as possible.The 10 rows of seats in front of the interpreters are reserved for hearing-impaired theatergoers, many of whom attend with hearing friends or family members. Attendance of deaf and hearing-impaired people has grown from a few the first night during ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' to a dozen for ''West Side Story.''Many hearing theatergoers said they were fascinated by the interpreters, and some have requested tickets for other interpreted performances, said Mrs. Bonacci, a New Fairfield resident who is a member of the Danbury Council for the Hearing Impaired. Others who have shown interest in these performances include special-education teachers and students of sign language, she said.The president of the council, James Silvestri, whose wife, Mary, and two of their three children are deaf, said, ''what they are doing is not just interpreting, it is a form of artistic expression.''The interpreters are not usually able to communicate every word that is sung or spoken, especially in rapid-fire numbers like ''America'' or ''Gee Officer Krupke,'' said Mrs. Bonacci. Instead, they will try to ''get across the gist of what's happening'' using facial expressions and body language to communicate such feelings as sarcasm, outrage, frustration and sorrow, she said.Signing is a skill that takes years of study and practice, ''before you are really comfortable with it and good at it,'' said Mrs. Tellio, whose husband, an accountant with G.T.E., is deaf. A teacher at the New York School for the Deaf in White Plains, she received a bachelor's degree in deaf education from New York University and a master's degree in the administration and supervision of special education from Columbia University. She also had additional training at Gallaudet College in Washington, D.C., a liberal-arts college for the deaf.Mrs. Bonacci, who is 35, received a bachelor's degree in speech and theater from Western Connecticut State College and studied interpreting at New York University as well as through programs offered by the University of Connecticut at its medical center in Farmington.The Danbury Council has provided the Candlewood Playhouse with a communications system that allows the hearing impaired to make reservations by telephone. Other shows this season that will be interpreted for the deaf are ''The Mikado,'' ''Hello, Dolly'' and Jesus Christ Superstar.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/nyregion/westchester-journal-deaf-in-mainstream.html", "headline": "DEAF IN MAINSTREAM", "date": "1986-06-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 15, 1986, Section WC, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Lehman College is the only public four-year institution in the area to offer the program, which will enable the students to take any course they wish and will provide oral and sign-language interpreters, counseling, tutoring and note-taking services to students who need help.''Right now there are eight identified students on campus who use some of the services, and we're aiming for five more next fall,'' said Miss Copeland, who has a master's degree in deafness rehabilitation and counseling from New York University. ''We hope to expand as time goes on but they are expensive programs.''Lehman College has received ''roughly $150,000'' for the program from the state and, Miss Copeland said, ''We're in the process of writing for different kinds of grants.'' The cost of providing necessary services for the deaf and hearing impaired is not low. For a student taking 12 credits a semester, for example, interpretive services alone are $2,700 to $3,000, Miss Copeland said. ''That's not talking about staff, interpretive tutors and note-taking services.''Miss Copeland said she would like to see programs for the deaf and hearing impaired such as hers spread nationwide so that ''all the services would be available to them in every college, that they not be limited in their choices.''Meanwhile, she said, Lehman students will have an advantage over most of their peers in the New York City area: ''Many will do well gradewise. Yes, they'll be able to succeed because they will have the appropriate academic information.''In a related event, the Lehman program is co-sponsoring ''Reflections'' - a program of dance, storytelling and mime performed by three deaf artists - which will be presented at 8 P.M. Saturday in the theater of the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, the other sponsor.Michael R. Jolliffe of Washington, D.C., is a mime and will making his first appearance in the state; Jimmy Turner, formerly of the American Deaf Dance Company will present a solo, and Mary Beth Miller, who was with the National Theater of the Deaf, will perform her latest work. The free performance will be interpreted for both the hearing and the hearing impaired. Tickets are required for ''Reflections'' and reservations are encouraged.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them.Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.A year ago, 2-year-old Adrienne Thal was diagnosed as having profound loss of hearing.Since then, two mornings a week, still wearing pajamas and carrying her breakfast cereal, the little girl has been bundled into an automobile for a two-hour drive from her grandmother's home in southern New Jersey to the League for the Hard of Hearing in Manhattan.At the league, she spends hours in speech therapy sessions, learning simple words like mommy, daddy, baby, nose and hand. She wears a lightweight hearing device that amplifies the therapist's voice. The goal is to prepare her to enter a nursery school for normal children, a goal not all handicapped children can achieve.Even with her disability, she is one of the luckier children who are making steady progress. But while the league has helped Adrienne, it had to turn away at least 50 other youngsters in the last year. Not Enough Resources''It breaks our hearts, but we do not have the resources to expand our staff and our facilities to meet the need,'' said Ruth R. Green, administrator of the league, a nonprofit agency. The league sees about 9,000 people a year, ranging from the newborn to those over 100 years old. Another 9,000 are tested in a specially equipped mobile bus that tours the city.''We're having to decide whom to serve - it becomes triage,'' Mrs. Green said. ''The adult can wait for services, but children cannot because the child has a critical time for learning language.''What is particularly troubling to Dr. Jane Madell, the league's director of audiology, is evidence that she says indicates an increasing number of babies are being born with severe hearing defects.She first noticed the increase about five years ago when the league began finding profound hearing loss about once a week in the youngsters it tested. In past years one case in five or six weeks was the average.At first, Dr. Madell said, she suspected her equipment was faulty. But then she consulted other specialists and found indications of a similiar increase in Texas, Rhode Island and California. U.S. Study Was InconclusiveThere are several causes of deafness, including heredity and also viral infections in either the fetus or mother.Dr. Madell said the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta conducted a study on the incidence of deafness in New York City in 1983, but results were inconclusive.The study and other research into deafness been handicapped by inadequate collection of data, Dr. Madell said. She said the league keeps statistics that show the increase in deafness, but not all centers have comparable record-keeping.She said she does not believe the increase can be explained as the result of more physicians referring cases to the league. Meanwhile, she said she was continuing to see a growing number of youngsters with severe impairment.There are other agencies serving the deaf in New York, but Mrs. Green said they usually focus on teaching a combination of American Sign Language, lip-reading and the use of hearing aids. Amplifying HearingThe league emphasizes using residual hearing as well as developing speech. Its philosophy, Mrs. Green said, is ''this better equips the youngster to function in the hearing world.''Dr. Madell said, ''Everyone has a little hearing, we drag it out of them.'' The league requires that children wear a six-ounce device that amplifies sounds. Instructors wear a lightweight, battery-powered microphone.The cost of providing equipment has posed an increasing problem for the league. It sells hearing aids at cost and charges a fee for its service, which is adjusted to family income. Medicaid pays a reimbursement for low-income families.But with increasing rent and salary costs for its staff of 35 specialists, the agency has had difficulty in meeting its annual $2 million budget - it had a $335,000 deficit last year. On Tuesday it will hold its 76th annual meeting at the McGraw-Hill Auditorium.There are 19 million Americans with impaired hearing, according to the league, and Mrs. Green said they were the ''largest physically disabled group in the country.'' She estimated 6 out of 10 people over the age of 60 suffer some hearing loss.Agencies serving the deaf always have experienced difficulty in fund-raising, she said, and the public tends to respond more generously to appeals for assistance for the blind.''A person can experience the calamity of being blind simply by closing one's eyes and understandably, this arouses a sympathetic response,'' Mrs. Green said. ''It's not the same with the deaf and few normal people understand the isolation they experience.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/13/nyregion/theater-of-deaf-to-tour-china.html", "headline": "THEATER OF DEAF TO TOUR CHINA", "date": "1986-04-13T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 13, 1986, Section CN, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Aided by two Chinese performers, the troupe will introduce Chinese audiences to its unusual performance style.''We're the first American company to go, and we'll bring a kind of theater developed here,'' said David Hays, founder and artistic director of the theater group.The National Theater of the Deaf, which now has eight deaf members and two hearing ones, has toured the United States and abroad for nearly 20 years with productions that blend sign language with the spoken word, which is provided by the hearing actors. Audiences are comprised mainly of hearing people who both hear and see every word.From May 2-18, audiences in Peking, Gangzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Shanghai will see the company's stylized, theatrical signing. They will also hear lines delivered in Mandarin by Wang Zhentai, an actor with the China Youth Art Theater, and by Lily Han. Miss Han, whose Chinese name is Lee Sheng Han Zhang, comes from Peking but is studying choreography at the University of California at Los Angeles, where her husband, Maobin Zhang, is a graduate student.Miss Han has been studying and rehearsing with the National Theater of the Deaf to prepare for the tour. Seated at a picnic table outside the renovated mill where the troupe's rehearsals are held, she recently recalled her first scene with the company.''My ears listened to English; my eyes watched sign language, and my mouth spoke Chinese,'' said Miss Han. ''It was very difficult. But I'm learning.''Miss Han joined rehearsals of ''Farewell, My Lovely,'' E. B. White's fond goodbye to the Model T Ford, and ''In a Grove,'' a mystery by Ryunosuke Akutugawa, the Japanese author of ''Rashomon.'' The company has been performing the two very different works throughout the United States and will take them to China.''We're as curious as anyone could be about what the Chinese think of these works,'' said Mr. Hays. ''They're just getting their appetites working for the auto, and E. B. White's piece is about an American's lifelong love of an auto.''The company modified the script of ''In a Grove,'' which deals with a rape and a violent death, because those subjects are not considered appropriate on the Chinese stage, Mr. Hays said.Explaining why he chose the works, the director said, ''the conflicting testimony of 'In a Grove' showed the company at its best, as marvelous storytellers, and I always loved White's essay and thought it would be wonderful on the stage.''As the rehearsal for ''Farewell, My Lovely,'' began, Miss Han gingerly patted the fender of the Model T that is featured in the show. Then she joined other cast members for a scene in which they showed accessories, such as patch kits and mirrors, that White described as optional purchases for ''the miracle that God hath wrought,'' as he called the Model T. Some performers signed White's words. Dolores T. Hughes, a hearing actress with the company, spoke softly in English to guide Miss Han, who spoke loudly and briskly in Chinese.Suddenly, however, Miss Han stopped, laughing.''I've lost it,'' she said aloud, moving her hand in small circles over her heart to make the sign that means, ''I'm sorry.''Company members noted, however, that Miss Han was doing her difficult task very well.''It takes a lot of concentration,'' said Charles Homet, a hearing member of the company.''Lily has really done her homework; she works smoothly, ''said Carole Addabbo, a deaf member of the troupe who spoke through a sign-language interpreter. ''I trust her to voice for me.''The tour presented special opportunities, troupe members said.''I think it will be the first time Chinese people see deaf people using sign language on stage,'' said Miss Han.''We want to show our theaterical skills, to show that we're equals,'' said Miss Addabbo. ''We hope the audience will look at us and realize that they should open their minds to the handicapped, and provide facilities.''Miss Han said that there were few facilities for handicapped people in China.Mr. Hays, noting that his group had helped establish deaf theater companies in several countries, including Australia and Japan, said the company could be instrumental in the formation of a deaf theater group in China.''Also, we hope our troupe breaks ground for other American acting companies,'' he said.The Chinese Theater Association extended the invitation for the tour, which is being financed through a grant for the Henry Luce Foundation of New York City.After leaving Shanghai, the company will stop briefly in Japan to work with that country's deaf theater troupe. The members will then return to Connecticut, where they will perform, ''Farewell, My Lovely'' and ''In a Grove'' at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, June 3-8."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/12/business/patents-sensor-on-arm-aids-lipreading-by-deaf.html", "headline": "PATENTS;\nSENSOR ON ARM AIDS LIP-READING BY DEAF", "date": "1986-04-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 12, 1986, Section 1, Page 34Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

That was Radar's cue. But instead of swinging into action, the mini-Pinscher jerked his head in confusion as he stood among a group of people in Judy Williams's living room in Bridgeport.Miss Williams, Radar's owner, wasn't worried. Her dog reacted the same way the week before when a television crew arrived to capture his performance on film.''There were many people here,'' she said. ''He didn't understand what was happening.''Besides, he's a smart dog. He knew I could see that light flashing.''Miss Williams knew that once her visitors had left, Radar would do what he was trained to do: to let her know when the phone rang, the alarm clock sounded, someone knocked at the door, or, most important, if the smoke alarm blared.Radar was certified earlier this month by the Red Acre Farm Hearing Dog Center, in Stow, Mass., to serve as Miss Williams's ears.Miss Williams, a 37-year-old teacher of autistic deaf children at the Elizabeth O'Hara Walsh School in Stratford, has been deaf since contracting diphtheria at the age of 2.Like many deaf people who live alone, she used to fear for her safety, she said.''It would be a good idea if all deaf people could have a hearing dog,'' she said through a translator, Yvonne Brown of Hamden, who helped her train Radar.''If people know a deaf person lives somewhere, they can break in,'' she said. ''Now I'm not worried about sleeping at night because of him.''The ''hearing'' dog concept was first tested 10 years ago in Denver in a program sponsored by the American Humane Association. Two dozen training centers now exist around country.Radar is the second dog that Red Acres Farm has placed in Connecticut; most of its dogs have been placed in Massachusetts and New York.Many of the dogs are mixed-breeds from kennels. They are taught to alert their owners upon hearing certain sounds.The dogs spend a six-month trial period in a deaf person's home before being certified to remain there permanently.MONY Financial Services, which has helped place 10 dogs in homes around the country, contributed $2,500 toward Radar's cost, with the remainder, or $500, paid by Miss Williams.During their trial period, Radar and Miss Williams grew fond of each other while working out some glitches.Radar picked up the phone signal pretty easily. Miss Williams communicates with callers by typing on a special machine.But noticing visitors at the door proved more difficult, because some people knock very softly.The problem was solved with the installation of an aluminum door, which augments even the slightest knocks.Miss Williams also taught Radar some sign language so that she could ask him if he needed to go out for a walk.She said Red Acre Farm was wise to name her dog Radar.''He's very alert, and he's very protective. If anyone ever tried to break in here, he'd tell me.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/16/us/deaf-councilman-s-busy-role-in-a-hearing-world.html", "headline": "DEAF COUNCILMAN'S BUSY ROLE IN A HEARING WORLD", "date": "1986-02-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 16, 1986, Section 1, Page 70Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Nolan is unabashed about comparing himself with Ronald Reagan. ''We have four things in common,'' he says. ''We are both fans of Calvin Coolidge, we both enjoy jelly beans, we both were actors, and we are both hearing-impaired.''Mr. Nolan, who was born deaf, understates his condition to make a point: He is handling his new political office without much difficulty. After a campaign against William C. Ames, a Republican who had been on the Northampton City Council for 20 years, Mr. Nolan, a Democrat, was elected to the City Council Nov. 5.It is a part-time job for the 40-year-old Mr. Nolan, who is a guidance counselor at the Clarke School for the Deaf, which is in the ''five-college area,'' including Smith, Mount Holyoke and Amherst Colleges, in this city of 30,000 people.On the wall of his school office, amid pictures of his family, there really is a portrait of Coolidge, the lawyer from Northampton who became President.''For the last 10 years,'' Mr. Nolan said in an interview, ''I wanted to go into politics but kept putting it off for lack of time and because I didn't know how people would react.'' Speech Is Relatively ClearCommunications was mostly a one-way problem: Although Mr. Nolan has never heard spoken language, he speaks relatively clearly. As a boy, he attended the Clarke School, which says it was the first in the country to teach its deaf students speech. It does not teach sign language, stressing adaptation to the hearing world instead.Mr. Nolan participates in the City Council's meetings every other week with the help of Dan Salvucci, who an interprets the proceedings for him. Facing Mr. Nolan, Mr. Salvucci silently repeats the comments made, providing the tone of the remarks through exaggerated facial expressions and occasional gestures.When Mr. Nolan wants to say something, he does, and if his speech needs interpreting for the Council members, Mr. Salvucci supplies it.Mr. Nolan decided to run for office last July and, with his friend and unofficial campaign manager, Bob Cahillane, sought votes door to door last fall. ''We went to nursing homes - we did a lot of basic footwork,'' said Mr. Cahillane, son of a former Mayor, James Cahillane. ''Our timing was right on. People were looking for a change. It got to a point where Mr. Ames was following him around.''William Ames, Mr. Nolan's opponent, called for a recount after Mr. Nolan won by seven votes. The recount showed Mr. Nolan the victor by 10 votes. 'A Real Fine Addition'''I think he's a real fine addition to the City Council, and it certainly says something about Northampton that he was elected,'' said Mayor David Musante. ''The people looked at Kevin and decided that he could do a fine job with or without a handicap.''Telephone conversations pose a problem because most constituents do not have the special equipment required. So Mr. Nolan takes messages from callers at the Clarke School and he then pays them a personal visit.''I received three calls from voters complaining about various things, and I came to their house and sat down and listened to them,'' said Mr. Nolan. ''It's better for me to come to their house so that we can have a face-to-face conversation. I know it's a double job for me, but I asked for it.''Mr. Nolan's wife, Linda Howe, teaches at the Clarke School, where the two met. They have three children, Kevin Jr., 11, Kristi Ann, 8, and Keith, 3, all of them deaf from birth, like their parents. A Role Model for StudentsMr. Nolan's election has inspired students at Clarke. ''I think his election demonstrates to our students that they can set their sights high and aim high,'' said Dr. Bill Blevins, assistant to the school's president. ''Kevin took a step forward into the hearing world. It makes him an example and a role model.''Mr. Nolan traveled to Washington for President Reagan's State of the Union speech, and he plans another trip there next Friday for a White House reception celebrating the 10th anniversary of passage of the Federal Special Education Act.Dr. Blevins has traveled with Mr. Nolan as his interpreter and plans to attend the reception with him.Mr. Nolan is a member of Northampton's Handicapped Services Committee, the Executive Office of Human Services Task Force on Handicapped and the Western Massachusetts Professional Group of the Deaf. He is the first deaf guidance counselor at the Clarke School.''Students will ask me if they can really become whatever they want to,'' he said. ''I always say yes - try it. If you fail, I'll respect you because you tried. I suppose I finally took my own advice.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/27/arts/art-of-sign-language.html", "headline": "Art of Sign Language", "date": "1985-12-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 27, 1985, Section C, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

In some ways the accounts by the city and the advocates are similar, in most ways they are not. Both, however, serve to put an unusually sharp focus on the crisis of the homeless, and how a system intended to help them somehow failed a seriously ill infant.Shamal's case has become a very public and political case, too, because the Coalition for the Homeless charged in a report that the baby ''spent repeated nights without shelter sleeping on the floor'' of a city welfare office, and that ''he was constantly seen dying by Human Resources Administration workers, but none intervened to protect him.''On a television program, a coalition volunteer, Gretchen Buchenholz, reported that Shamal had ''spent his last three days of life living in an emergency assistance unit sleeping on a filthy floor.''It is the group's argument that the baby died because the system failed him. It is the city's argument, spelled out in a report released yesterday, that while the system had weaknesses, all city workers did their jobs properly.The baby did spend at least two nights in a welfare office, but according to his own mother, the city report said, he slept in a stroller.Stella Schindler, assistant administrator for external affairs at the Human Resources Adminsitration, said that based on her review of the case ''everyone concerned did his or her job conscientiously.'' Because Shamal died.'' She and George Gross, the H.R.A. Administrator, conceded a need for improvements and yesterday said that doctors and nurses would be assigned to the welfare offices.The city's history of Shamal shows that his mother, Elizabeth Jackson, was involved in a series of disputes with welfare hotels because she allowed Shamal's father into her room.The city's review also showed that Miss Jackson was beaten by the father of her other two children. Because of the mother's beating, the baby was not fed for several hours and advocates for the homeless said Shamal was brought to a hospital emergency room at the time, 5 percent dehydrated.Moreover, welfare, emergency housing and hospital officials all knew that the family had a baby who was in terribly frail health with no adequate home to go to.But Mr. Gross said that during Shamal's entire life ''there was never a complaint filed with the state's Central Registry charging neglect or abuse.'' Thus, he said, Special Services for Children, the agency that would investigate such complaints ''was not involved with respect to abuse or neglect.'' He added that, by law, he could not comment on the content of any of that agency's cases.Frank Lopez, director of public relations for Beth Israel, said the hospital had been in ''constant and continuous contact with Special Services for Children and all other social service departments,'' about Shamal. He said the hospital would never have released the baby had it known he had no proper shelter, although the family had a note from a Beth Israel doctor that it be given ''suitable housing to support his condition.''Mrs. Schindler of H.R.A. said that ''the baby had a mother and father, he had the doctors at Beth Israel, he had visiting nurses, he had the Emergency Assistance workers.''They Did Their Job''I might wish that at any one point any one of these people might have said this baby ought to be in a less hectic environment,'' she said.But, she added, the Emergency Assistance workers, who saw the family with the tiny baby daily during the week of May 1 and frequently in the weeks before that did what they were supposed to do - ''found the family shelter, gave them money for transportation and money for food.''Advocates for the homelesss said that, indeed, Shamal was treated just as thousands of other homeless children are treated every day, but in this case, the child was too weak, too sick, too tiny to cope.''Shamal died because he didn't have the strength to resist the system's abuse,'' said Robert M. Hayes, counsel to the Coalition for the Homeless.For all his short, sad life, Shamal and his family were homeless, living for a night, a week or sometimes several months in shabby welfare hotels, waiting for shelter in welfare offices, traveling on subways late at night. According to the city, the baby and his family spent two nights sleeping in the Brooklyn welfare office. The coalition contends they spent four nights there. #4 Efforts to Get Shelter In fact, from May 1 - when the baby was released from Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan with a shunt implanted in his head to draw off water from his brain - to May 7 when he went back to Beth Israel before he died, Shamal and his family spent most of their time in a welfare office looking for shelter.The city's review shows that over a period of eight months, four efforts were made to provide the Jacksons with long-term placements in hotels, the last on the very night the baby went into the hospital. In two instances, the city said, the family argued with the hotel management and was either evicted or never accepted. In the third, it said, Miss Jackson rejected the placement.On the evening of May 6, the family was finally offered a long-term shelter in the highly reputable Red Cross Family Center, which the mother declined because the center does not allow visitors. The baby's father had been staying with the family.That placement was offered, said Steven Banks, a Legal Aid Society lawyer, only because the Coalition for the Homeless notified him of the family's plight. He said he had called lawyers for the H.R.A. on May 5 to demand that Shamal be given suitable shelter. According to Mr. Hayes, the night the family was finally offered suitable shelter, Miss Jackson took Shamal to the hospital because he was sick. He had diarrhea and had been vomiting, Mr. Hayes said. #4 1/2 Pounds at Birth Shamal was born Sept. 28, 1984, in Beth Israel. His mother was 22 years old at the time, and she and her two other children, ages 6 and 4, and Shamal's father were all living in one room at the Martinique Hotel. Shamal was born weighing four and a half pounds, and several days after his birth, Mr. Hayes said, he contracted a virus that left him brain-damaged, blind, deaf, hydrocephalic and with a seizure disorder.Because he was so small and frail, the baby remained in Beth Israel until Christmas Eve, when he was discharged weighing seven pounds. A picture taken around that time by the parents shows a pretty baby with large black eyes. The baby is sitting in a baby seat, and his head - overly large because he had water on the brain - has been partly, artfully covered with a small towel.When Shamal was 5 months old, doctors at Beth Israel noted, according to Mr. Hayes, that Shamal ''is awake, alert, and responsive to touch.'' The baby ''repeatedly smiles,'' the hospital note stated. Mr. Hayes said that when the baby was readmitted the last time, hospital records showed, ''he was grossly dehydrated. His skin was dry and shriveled and his eyes were sunken.'' He weighed seven pounds. Mr. Gross said yesterday that the city's review showed ''the primary weakness illustrated by this tragic story is lack of coordinated and focused services.'' He added, ''Many services were provided, but the family was never singled out as particularly vulnerable and high-risk.''On May 20, Shamal died in Beth Israel. His mother was told of his death when she came to visit him. Days later, the Coalition for the Homeless paid for the baby's funeral."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/nyregion/theater-group-addresses-the-deaf.html", "headline": "THEATER GROUP ADDRESSES THE DEAF", "date": "1985-12-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 15, 1985, Section CN, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

While one group travels through India and Nepal, the other is visiting schools in Connecticut.For 18 years, the company, most of whose members (are deaf, have toured the United States and other countries with performances that blend sign language, body movement and the spoken word.''For us, the challenge is to take a piece of language and make it visual,'' said Michael Lamitola, a deaf actor who has been with the company for several years and who, like other company members, is usually aided by a sign language interpreter.He talked after a pre-tour rehearsal in which the actor Charles Homet, who is not deaf, narrated a riddle about Scorpio as the rest of the cast wriggled two fingers out and in, making ''V'' shapes, to sign ''crab.''Performing on stage is not the company's only challenge, Mr. Lamitola said.''We're role models,'' he said. ''Some places are behind on the issue of deafness. They say, 'Oh, deaf people.' ''During the company's first visit to India in 1981, he recalled, ''I think people said, 'What is this?' They came out of curiosity. But we blew their minds away. People really enjoyed it. They asked us back.''The current tour includes the company's first visit to Nepal and its second to India.''I've been eager to go back to India,'' said David Hays, who founded the company and serves as its artistic director. ''On that first tour, we met many people who felt the time had come to start a deaf performing company there.''''On the second trip, I hope to really talk with people interested in performing and in organizing,'' he said, and referring to the theater's summer program for deaf-theater personnel, added: ''I hope we can arrange for young deaf people with talent to come to our school.''After the Connecticut and foreign tours are over, the entire company will perform at the Chester Meeting House from Christmas Day until Dec. 29.Mr. Hays has chosen the same works for both tours and for the holiday performances.''Young people everywhere are more alike than different,'' he said.He chose, he said, American works and works that, in this year of Halley's comet, call attention to the skies. He picked a collection of Zodiac tales and an extract from ''Captain Stormfield's Visit To Heaven, '' in which the captain races a comet.''Haley's comet will pass over India and Nepal, too,'' he pointed out.Before the tours got under way, the two theatre companies rehearsed separately at the renovated mill that serves as the theater's headquarters.Betty Beekman, who has stage-managed many of the company's productions, directed the members who are performing in area schools.They tackled the Zodiac piece. In sign and voice, Miss Beekman asked for suggestions. Soon Mr. Homet, the group's narrator, began typing on an imaginary typewriter while tap dancing on the mill floor. Shanny Mow, an actor who was deaf, rapidly dribbled an imaginary basketball with one hand and brushed his teeth with the other.Upstairs, four actors rehearsing Captain Stormfield's race had to dump Sandi Inches, a deaf member of the company, from their shoulders. She represented the cargo - Twain called it it ''eighteen hundred thousand billion quintillions of Kazarks'' - that had to be tossed overboard for the comet to overtake the captain.The upstairs group also rehearsed ''Journeys,'' a collection of prose by children. Dolores Hughes, a hearing performer, served as narrator as Vicki Winetrup, who is deaf, related with many clearly-recognizable signs a 10-year-old's tale about how man was created from red leaves (his lips) and a carrot (his nose). Charles Struppmann vigorously signed another youngster's tale about a man who caused green fungus to spread over the earth and into outer space.Mr. Hays, who also signs, directed the India-bound group.Company members, all of whom will tour China this spring, said being deaf caused them no special problems when traveling abroad. They are accustomed to making themselves understood without spoken language.Miss Inches, who has worked in the company's tours for several years, told about how she found medical help on the company's 1981 tour in Japan.One night, alone in a small Japanese town - the other company members had gone to a restaurant -and ill with bronchitis, Miss Inches found a hospital.''I knew I had to go in,'' she said. Using gestures, she described her problem to the doctor. He not only gave her medicine, but, using gestures, also showed her how to stir it and how much to take.''He looked awkward,'' she recalled. ''I knew he wasn't used to working like that. But I got well.''Wherever they perform for young people, company members usually end their show with ''Your Game,'' in which they act out audience requests, from birds to tractors. Sometimes, abroad, they get requests to describe locally familiar items. ''A child in India asked us to do a rickshaw,'' Mr. Lamitola recalled.Other times, youngsters in other lands ask for something American. ''Once, in Japan, someone asked us to be Jimmy Carter,'' said Mr. Lamitola, shaking his head."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/08/nyregion/opening-athletics-to-deaf-players.html", "headline": "OPENING ATHLETICS TO DEAF PLAYERS", "date": "1985-09-08T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from September 8, 1985, Section 11LI, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Although his high school statistics (4,077 yards rushing, 56 touchdowns) earned him a 1983 prep player of the year award, Hofstra was the only college that paid any great interest to his athletic talents.The lack of interest was because Metz has been deaf since birth and his records were achieved at the Indiana High School for the Deaf in Indianapolis. When he was recruited for Hofstra by the athletic director, Robert Getchell, in 1984, Metz became the first graduate of the Indiana school to attend a regular college.This year, Steve McNeese, the 1984 deaf prep player of the year, has also joined the Hofstra football team. McNeese broke many of Metz's records playing football at the Mississippi School for the Deaf in Jackson, where he compiled career statistics of 4,353 yards and 46 touchdowns.According to Getchell, who has worked with deaf athletes through the World Games for the Deaf, ''Deaf college football players are very rare. Metz and our new player, McNeese, may be the only two deaf kids now playing N.C.A.A. division football in the country.''Most big-time college sports programs simply have not felt it possible to accommodate the deaf athlete. Hofstra does. ''The two kids both have to make many adjustments, and so do the coaches and the other players on the team,'' Getchell said, ''but we're committed to opening up Hofstra to deaf athletes.''Hofstra also has a deaf player, Willie Brown, of Macon, Ga., on its basketball team.''Our feeling is,'' said the football coach, Mickey Kwiatkowski, ''that whatever we're teaching, if you can't also instruct deaf people, we're not teaching it.''Kwiatkowski has taken four sign-language courses and will take more. ''I will become an expert before this is over,'' he said.Hofstra has hired an interpreter to sign everything the coaches say to Metz and McNeese in preseason practices. The interpreter attends all team meetings, practices and team dinners. It is, Kwiatkowski said, ''a total commitment on our part.''Football, beyond the phyical aspect, is an intricate game of signals and audibles - last-second play adjustments. To accommodate the deaf players Hofstra has revamped its offense, even down to its huddle. The players are learning sign language; in the huddle the quarterback calls the plays and then signs them.''When I get to the line of scrimmage and into my stance,'' said Metz through an interpreter, ''I look at the ball. When it moves, I go. If there is an audible, the guard makes a sign behind his back and then I know when to move.''Kwiatkowski expects Metz to get considerable playing time this year ''if he stays healthy.'' As a freshman at Hofstra, Metz rushed 14 times for 119 yards and two touchdowns in three games before he was injured.McNeese is a speedy back. As a high school sophomore in Mississippi he was timed as the fastest in the state for the 60-yard dash and low hurdles. But, Kwiatkowski said, ''before we play McNeese he has to get his feet wet academically. He could play some this year, but I'm not counting on it. I tend not to play freshmen much anyway, if I can help it.''''I have a lot to learn,'' McNeese agreed. ''It's an adjustment just moving to this campus from Mississippi. I want to get to know the campus first.''Kwiatkowski has his ambitions, too, regarding deaf players. ''My goal is in maybe four or five years to be watching the Rose Bowl and some deaf kid scores the winning touchdown,'' he said. ''Then the announcer says, 'And it all started at a little school in New York called Hofstra, which took a chance on these kids.'

I was greeted with that meow just now as I returned home from talking with the staff of a nursing home about hearing impairment. Maybe what I have learned from my own disability will spare hard-of-hearing patients in that nursing home the frustration of not understanding and not being understood.Not many of the people I run into are as considerate as Thumbelina. She looks at me when she meows and she never puts her paw over her mouth - unlike most bus drivers, lecturers and sales personnel in stores. But I have learned to speak up and make my feelings known to the large number of people who just don't know how to talk with a hard-of-hearing person.It wasn't always this way. At one time, I hid my hearing aid under a long hair-do, pretended I heard what was being talked about and stayed silent lest I make a fool of myself by repeating something that had already been said. At work, I lived in fear of being made to appear stupid. Socially, I was a dropout. As a woman - I was a young widow then - I lived with the assumption that no man could ever want a woman he had to speak loudly to.I decided to study sign language and work with deaf people. I learned respect for the language and those who use it, and I cherish the friendships I have made among deaf people. But the subculture I discovered was made up of people who shared experiences that I had never had. Although my world is silent until I put on a hearing aid, I hear rather well with it. My impairment did not become severe until middle adulthood; I heard normally as a child. I found in my associations with the deaf that here, too, I was an outsider.Now I stand on the inside. I have a new husband, many friends and, solidly behind me, S.H.H.H. S.H.H.H. stands for Self Help for Hard of Hearing People. It is a national, rapidly growing organization with headquarters in Bethesda, Md., and eight chapters in the New York City area alone. The Westchester Chapter meets at the Burke Rehabilitation Center in White Plains on the first Saturday of each month. S.H.H.H. has made a big difference - for me and for countless others.In S.H.H.H., we share our experiences and our ways of coping. We hear speakers who teach us about our own disability, about services available to us and about the wonderful new world of electronic devices that can help us listen. Some of us have learned lip-reading; others have been helped by assertiveness-training courses. All of us are speaking up for our rights as never before and are becoming more comfortable with the mistakes we make.The other day, I mailed a package at the post office. The clerk asked, ''How do you want it sent?'' I reached into my wallet and pulled out 91 cents. When the puzzled clerk repeated her question, I laughed and explained that ''91 cents'' was what I had heard her say. She laughed, too - and now I feel the warmth of that shared joke whenever I buy stamps from her. Once I would have cringed, maybe cried.Perhaps the most important thing I've learned is that it helps me to help others. How can you be withdrawn when you are giving of yourself? Through the Westchester Long-Term-Care Ombudsman Program, I have been able to share what I've learned where it is most needed and that sharing has brought me satisfaction and joy.It all started at the national convention of S.H.H.H. in 1984. Six of us from Westchester attended and we parceled out the workshops so they would all be covered. One that was allotted me was entitled ''An Ombudsman Program for Hearing-Impaired Residents in Nursing Homes.'' There I learned there is a National Ombudsman Program for nursing homes and adult homes; that an ombudsman is a volunteer who insures that the rights of residents in long-term care facilities are protected; that many residents are hearing impaired and that their special needs are often neglected or misunderstood. The speaker at the workshop, the assistant director of the Monroe County, N.Y., Long-Term-Care Ombudsman Program, had developed a project to meet those needs. She spoke with such enthusiasm that I came home eager to find out what was being done in Westchester.I was warmly received at Westchester's Long-Term-Care Ombudsman Program. Its program directors were aware of the problem and they were satisfied that I had some knowledge of and insight into hearing impairment. But, they asked, what did I know about nursing homes? Next to nothing, I replied. It was suggested that I conduct an in-service program on hearing impairment for the volunteer ombudsmen, but not before I had attained some understanding of what it is that ombudsmen do. How about dropping in, the director suggested, on a couple of sessions of the ombudsmen training course? I thought that was a good idea. I planned, at first, to attend the program for an hour or two - but, once there, I saw no sense in cutting short my involvement. I stayed, fascinated, and soon asked if I might earn an ombudsman certificate myself.I'm very glad I did. During the last year, I have talked with the volunteer ombudsmen and, through their efforts, with the staffs of several nursing homes, I have acted as consultant to the ombudsmen and trouble-shooters with their problems in dealing with hearing-impaired residents. And, I myself, have worked as a volunteer ombudsman and have found that I can establish a special rapport with hard-of-hearing residents because of my own impairment.''How's it going today?'' I asked as I entered the patient's room.''Oh, you're going away?'' Tears came to her tired brown eyes.''No, I'm staying here. Are you feeling all right today?'' I know better than to repeat what I have said. I always rephrase. I know from my own experience how important rephrasing is -and the patients know why I know. They appreciate the real empathy that only a hearing-impaired person can offer.It is my hope that such empathy will soon be offered by volunteers in long-term care facilities across the country. I have been asked to be chairman of the national S.H.H.H. Ombudsman Committee. As we draw up national plans and I gain insight from those who are working with me, I will expect my experiences to be more satisfying than ever.You don't have to be hard-of-harding to experience the satisfaction I've felt as an ombudsman. Everyone has personal experiences that enable him to relate in a special way to the lonely isolated people who live in long-term care facilities.A new group of ombudsmen will begin training in September. If you're interested, telephone the Long-Term-Care Ombudsman Program at 949-6741. The program is administered by the Mental Health Association of Westchester County and financed by the Westchester County Office for the Aging under the Older Americans Act.

On a recent day, its director, Andrew Vasnick, was looking over the students, faculty and staff members, interpreters and visitors having lunch.''The most important thing about the school is this: where else in the world could you get all these people together in one place?'' said Mr. Vasnick, a 59-year-old teacher and actor who is deaf.Among those eating and chatting -in both sign language and English -were some of this year's 22 students from 10 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, Israel and Australia. All work in theater or want to, and the few hearing students are sign-language interpreters. Six days a week, from June 9 to July 6, they attend classes in acting, playwriting, movement and other subjects.Many of these students will return home to act and direct in regional theaters for the deaf or to teach in other programs for the deaf around the world.Also gathered at the lunch were working members of the National Theater of the Deaf, which has made international tours, performed at the Olympics Arts Festival in Los Angeles last summer and won a Tony Award in 1977 for theatrical excellence. The company is planning a tour of China next year. All but two of their actors are deaf, and in their productions, the two speak the lines while the others use sign language.Karen Braun, a deaf student from Saskatchewan, became interested in attending the theater workshop last winter. Until last October, she just taught sign language, she said. But a Saskatchewan theater group announced auditions for a production of ''Children of a Lesser God,'' in which the female lead, Sarah, is deaf. ''I decided to read up on the play and audition,'' said Mrs. Braun. She got the part of Sarah.''Now I want to improve, do that role again and other roles.'' she said. ''I wanted to come where I could learn with other deaf people. Maybe I could offer theater workshops for deaf children.''The rehearsals at the school are demanding. On the recent morning, Gene Lasko, a faculty member who teaches and directs at the Actor's Studio in New York, was watching pairs of students rehearsing short scenes, in sign language.''Don't make it easier for her to do that scene,'' he admonished Maureen O'Keefe, a student from Texas, after she worked with Marie Lucas, from Colorado. ''You're not here to help the other actor. That ignores the conflict of the scene.''In their classes, the actors worked on making their facial expressions clear and their sign language easily understandable to deaf audience members yards away. They do not usually sign individual letters of the alphabet, as they might in conversations with friends; rather, they sign words and broader concepts in a theatrical style - the sign-language equivalent of Shakespearean delivery.For cues to their lines they must rely on the visual or the sensory, like a dip in the lights or the vibration of a foot stomping on the floor.They also worked on developing a commanding stage presence without the benefit of the voice. ''In the hearing theater it's easy to call attention by yelling,'' said Koli Cutler, a student from Freemont, Calif., who is trained as a sign-language interpreter. ''Here actors must focus on who has the floor. In the deaf theater, everybody must watch what's going on. You have to take control.''After lunch, Shanny Mow, a playwright who is deaf, taught a class on play structure. ''I'm trying to teach them what constitutes a good play,'' he said.Both Mr. Mow and Mr. Vasnick noted that the professional school was unique in offering full training in both theater arts and leadership to deaf people. ''I try to involve people from college and community theaters,'' said Mr. Vasnick.''They become leaders in their own theaters,'' said Mr. Mow, adding ''Our students have their deaf pride, but what we do here goes far beyond the deaf community.''Ronald Bangs, who attended a conference for deaf playwrights at the school, won an Emmy for his television adaptation of ''The Miser'' by Moliere. Often students and graduates work daily with hearing people. Many are active in the many regional theaters of the deaf (like the Fairmont in Cleveland) and in theaters of the deaf in Australia, Japan, England and Scandinavia. Like the N.T.D., these companies perform mainly for hearing audiences.In 1967, Mr. Vasnick taught in one of the N.T.D.'s earliest projects, a ''grueling'' training program for deaf actors. Some students from it were asked to join the first N.T.D. company, for stage and television performances. To his surprise, Mr. Vasnick was also asked to join. Until then, he recalled, he had simply used theater techniques to teach literature and poetry at Gallaudet College, a liberal-arts college for the deaf in Washington. Aside from time out for other teaching assignments, Mr. Vasnick has been with the N.T.D., and what became its annual school, ever since.During the summer program the N.T.D. members also attend classes, like Mr. Bignotti's seminar.Former company members often teach classes at the school. One instructor this year is Ed Waterstreet, now with the American Theater Association in Los Angeles. Mr. Waterstreet and his wife, Linda Bove, who appeared as a deaf character on Sesame Street, were with the N.T.D. for several years. Mr. Vasnick gave credit to David Hays, founder of the N.T.D. and set designer for several Broadway shows, with bringing many theater professionals to the staff.The school is accredited by Connecticut College in New London and supported by the United States Department of Education, special education programs, which pays the $1,700 for tuition, room and monthlong board for most of the American students. Mr. Vasnick would like to obtain financing for scholarships for foreign students."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/10/opinion/washington-the-dead-and-the-deaf.html", "headline": "  THE DEAD AND THE DEAF", "date": "1985-02-10T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 10, 1985, Section 4, Page 21Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

For the last month, his successor as General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, Konstantin U. Chernenko, has disappeared from public view. So the rumors fly like snowflakes around the capitals of the world, but nobody knows where or how he is.This is the tangle in the line of U.S.- Soviet communications. We can negotiate with the Russians in Geneva next month about the control of nuclear weapons, but we don't know how to talk to the people in Moscow who give the orders, or even know who they are.The contrast between the two political systems has seldom been more obvious than in the last few days: President Reagan proclaiming a second American revolution, as if the first one had failed, followed by a torrent of questions and protest not only from the opposition but his own Congressional leaders and budget director; and meanwhile in Moscow, nothing but Pravda's endlessly boring and badly written propaganda.The last time the leaders of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. met was in Vienna in l979. President Carter and Leonid Brezhnev got on fairly well and wondered why they hadn't met sooner. But by then Mr. Brezhnev was stumbing over the curbstones and was soon gone.In fairness to President Reagan, while at first he didn't want to talk to the Russians and then changed his tune, the fact is that during his first term it seemed too late to talk to the ailing Brezhnev and too early to talk to Mr. Andropov, who died not long after taking control. And Mr. Chernenko, whatever his doctor says, seems to be drifting into the shadows.Maybe it was wrong in the first place to think that talking to a particular Soviet leader made all that much difference. Personal control of Soviet policy lasted from Lenin to Stalin, and maybe marginally to Khrushchev, who had some glimmers of the possibility of reconciliation and cooperation with the West. But after that, the collective system of leadership prevailed more than ever before.Yet even over the last generation there clearly has been a chance for serious talk about the fundamental interests and differences between the two major nuclear powers.The Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko, now 75 and the informing mind of Soviet foreign policy, came to Washington for the first time 46 years ago. As Foreign Minister since 1957, he has had personal access to 14 U.S. Secretaries of State and every President since Roosevelt.The Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin, has been here for 23 years, and is now dean of the diplomatic corps. He has had more access to six Presidents and their Secretaries of State than any diplomat of the last generation.The main problem is not the incidence of death - mortality at least we have in common - but the dialogue of the living deaf. Washington and Moscow say many sensible things about their common interests - shout them across the world on the radio waves - but they don't listen and they don't believe.For example, both are now saying that they not only want to control and reduce nuclear weapons, but get rid of them and use peaceful atomic energy for the benefit of a hungry world. Also, Moscow wants Washington to promise not to be the first to use atomic weapons. Washington rejects this on the ground that this would leave the Soviet Union free, with its commanding lead in conventional weapons, to dominate and intimidate Western Europe.Just the other day, the Russians suggested at the Stockholm conference that both sides commit themselves not to use military force of any kind, nuclear or conventional, against each other or their allies; but because there is no trust, there was no agreement and not even much discussion.So what to do when the hot line is pulled?Some think the answer lies with Cappy Weinberger, who wants to build nuclear ships as long as the Brooklyn Bridge and bring the Russians to their senses in outer space if not on earth. Others place their faith in a new generation of Soviet leaders like Mikhail Gorbachev, who at 53 is better educated but lacks the personal knowledge of the old men who remember the carnage of the two world wars.The trouble is that there really isn't much serious analysis of this problem by U.S. and Soviet historians and philosophers, and when there is, it tends to loiter down into polemics. It is this dialogue of the deaf that is the real problem, and it's not likely to be resolved in Geneva unless it begins in Washington and Moscow."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/nyregion/implant-device-aids-the-deaf.html", "headline": "IMPLANT DEVICE AIDS THE DEAF", "date": "1985-01-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 27, 1985, Section 11CN, Page 7Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Following a bout with meningitis while in the Navy, Mr. Gold lost his hearing, one year before he met and married his wife, Virginia. ''Silence is golden, but enough is enough,'' Mr. Gold, 60 years old, said two weeks ago as he became the first person in Connecticut to receive a single-channel cochlear implant at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in West Haven. The operation will enable him to better distinguish sounds, though it will not restore his hearing entirely.About 500 cochlear implants have been done worldwide, but until recently the operation was still considered to be experimental.The veterans hospital has entered into an agreement with the Yale University Medical School to perform surgery on non-veterans at West Haven. It also just received a $500,000 grant from the Veterans Administration's Rehabilitation Research Service to study the results of the single- channel cochlear implant in a group of veterans. Mr. Gold was the first veteran to receive the implant in a V.A. hospital, said Dr. Steven B. Leder, a research speech pathologist at the West Haven center.The implant, developed in the 1960's by Dr. William F. House of the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles, was approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration last month.''The Government wants to be sure that the device works efficiently before they make it available - at no charge - to veterans throughout the country,'' said Dr. Leder. The cost to non-veterans for the implant will be about $15,000, he said.The cochlear implant allows profoundly deaf patients who cannot wear a hearing aid an opportunity to distinguish between sounds while enhancing their lip-reading abilities. The device, manufactured by the 3M Company of St. Paul, Minn., enablesrecipients to hear sounds - loud and soft - and rhythm. To a much lesser degree, they may hear frequency.For example, Mr. Gold eventually will be able to differentiate between a telephone ring and a knock on the door. He will know when the vacuum is on. With training, he will learn not to mistake his wife's voice for that of his children. He will be able to use those sounds to help him with lip reading.There are appoximately 60,000 to 200,000 people in the United States who may benefit from the implanted device, said Dr. Leder.''People with a hearing loss greater than 110 decibels who are not able to benefit from a hearing aid may be a candidate for this device,'' he said.Research has shown that people will hearing problems hear sounds more clearly with a hearing aid than with the new device.''This procedure is clearly for people who cannot benefit from a hearing aid,'' Dr. Leder said. ''It serves a completely different purpose. If people can rely on a hearing aid, then it means that they still have a few hair cells left in the cochlea, or the inner ear. When there is absolutely no hearing, this operation can help.''Hair cells are tiny cells that transmit sound to the nerves. In Mr. Gold's case, a lack of hair cells prevents him from hearing. The human ear is divided into the outer, middle and inner ear. The outer ear stems from the ear lobe to the ear drum. The middle ear is a series of three bones - the malleus, incus and stapes - that resemble a hammer, anvil and stirrup, respectively. The cochlea makes up the inner ear.In normal hearing, the outer ear collects the sound, also known as acoustic energy. The middle ear converts this energy into mechanical energy, that in turn is changed into electrical energy in the cochlea. The electrical energy travels via nerves to the brain's auditory cortex. The brain then interprets the sound. The medical team at the veterans hospital will do the implant only in patients who lost their hearing after they acquired speech and language.The implant is composed of a magnetized internal coil implanted under the skin behind the ear, tucked into the temporal bone. Two wires or electrodes come out of the coil: one goes into the cochlea and one is grounded into a muscle.In the operation at West Haven, Dr. J. Cameron Kirchner and Dr. Linda Gardiner of Yale Medical School hallowed out the mastoid bone behind Mr. Gold's ear and broke through the middle ear cavity to push the electrode through into the cochlea.In six weeks, Mr. Gold is to return to the hospital so that the research team can activate the device. The magnet on the internal coil will act as a receiver. A small external transmitter, connected to a signal processor worn in either the shirt pocket or on a belt, will be held magnetically in place on the skin behind the ear. A microphone will be attached to the external coil, or worn on eye glasses. Dr. Leder explained that a sound is heard at the microphone, then travels down to the signal processor, up to the external transmitter and over the skin barrier to the internal coil. A small electrical current goes to the electrode and stimulates the nerve, producing an impulse in the brain that is then interpreted as sound.The electrode stimulates the cochlea, by-passing the outer and middle ear.''It doesn't sound like regular speech,'' said Dr. Leder, explaining that patients must go through intensive rehabilitation to relearn sounds. The sounds, he added, are likened to a radio that is slightly off the station. ''It is like a faint buzz,'' he said. The research team at West Haven consists of three physicians, three researchers and one program coordinator. They are evaluating one person each week for the device. A second implant was scheduled to be done this week.Before deciding to go through with the surgery, the research team showed Mr. Gold, an administrator at Bucknell University in Bethlehem, Pa., how to use a vibro-tactile aid that converts sounds into vibrations. The aid, a box containing a microphone that can be held, did not require any surgery and was used to show him what he could potentially hear with the implant.During a conversation with one of the doctors, Mr. Gold turned to aresearcher who was trying impatiently to enter into the conversation. ''Would you please be quiet?'' he asked.Moments later, he realized it had been four decades since he had uttered those words. He used the aid also during his hospital stay when he heard, or felt, the vibrations of a sneeze.Mr. Gold told physicians that it will be ''thrilling'' to hear again.For more information on cochlear implant devices, call the V.A. Medical Center at 932-5711, ext. 539."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/us/postal-service-s-phone-line-takes-comments-from-deaf.html", "headline": "Postal Service's Phone Line Takes Comments From Deaf", "date": "1985-01-06T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 6, 1985, Section 1, Page 36Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

''We have a whole series of beautiful laws that no other state has, or if they have it's not as efficient or as loaded with teeth as ours,'' said the executive director, Barbara B. Brasel in an interview. Mrs. Brasel, who has been deaf since the age of 6, has headed the commission since it began operating in February 1975. Prior to that, the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation was the only agency that served the state's deaf and hearing-impaired. can't hear at all''It was limited in the amount of service they could provide,'' she said through her secretary, who also functions as an interpreter, using sign language.Among the bills the commission has persuaded the legislature to enact is one requiring all police departments in the state to provide an interpreter when a deaf person is arrested, is a witness, or is the victim of a crime. ''If the police arrest a man and don't provide him with an interpreter, how can you explain the Miranda warnings to him if he can't communicate?'' she said, referring to the rights of the accused to counsel and to remain silent. Mr. Brasel said that the average deaf person has a third- to fifth-grade reading level and is unable to fully understand complicated written material. ''It has to be explained to him,'' she said. ''You have to interpret what that says.''Another bill, passed during the 1983 session of the legislature, established a program to help provide the deaf and hearing-impaired with devices equipped with keyboards that permit communication over normal telephone lines. The program is financed through an annual grant of $100,000 from the Southern New England Telephone Company.In addition, Mrs. Brasel said, her agency was able to convince the State Department of Public Utility Control to reduce by 75 percent the charges for in-state long distance calls by deaf people using the phone devices. ''It takes from five to 10 times longer to type a message than it does to speak the same message,'' she said.When it began operating in 1975, the commission had a staff of two and an annual budget of $75,000. The full- time staff now numbers 18, 4 of whom are deaf, and there are 50 part-time interpreters. Mrs. Brasel said her agency's budget request for the next fiscal year totals $1.3 million, including Federal funds. While the commission has more than 5,000 cases in its files, there is no firm count on how many Connecticut residents are deaf or hearing impaired - those with partial hearing.''Right now we're traveling on a lot of estimates and impressions,'' said Richard B. Schreiber, the commission's deputy director. Mr. Schreiber said that, based on a national study conducted by New York University in 1973, the commission projects that there are about 170,000 hearing-impaired people in Connecticut, of whom 25,000 can be considered deaf. ''Right now,'' he said, ''we're trying to come up with a reasonable estimate of the number of deaf persons who are at risk for alcoholism. We've developed a questionnaire that we're going to mail out to a sampling of deaf persons throughout the state.''Mr. Schreiber said it is not known whether alcoholism among the deaf is any greater than among the general population. ''We need some statewide data on all handicapped citizens throughout the state,'' he said. ''We need to know the nature of the handicapped, we need to know where the people are located.''Mr. Schreiber said he hoped the commission would be able to begin addressing the special needs of Hispanic and black deaf people. Spanish sign language is different from that used in English-speaking countries, and black people in some regions of the country use special dialects to communicate.Mrs. Brasel said it has been difficult for the commission to plan for the future because ''up until now we have more or less moved in response to demonstrated need.'' But she said she hoped that eventually the commission would be able to open satellite offices around the state or at its headquarters in Hartford. ''The legislature will never give me the money for it,'' she said, ''so what we're doing in lieu of opening some offices is helping some community- service agencies develop a plan or a grant proposal to hire specialized people to provide that service to deaf people in their areas.''Such a program was recently established in Bridgeport, and plans are being made for a similar program in Norwich.

Delta Line is phasing out the Santa Maria, the Santa Magdalena and the Santa Mariana. Each accommodating fewer than 100 passengers, the vessels - built in 1964 by the Grace Line for cargo and luxury travel - earned high repute on voyages that circumnavigated South America, passing through the Panama Canal in the north and around the Strait of Magellan in the south.The 54-day voyages on these Grand Circle Cruises touched at ports from Manzanillo in Mexico and Balboa in the Canal Zone to Cartagena, Puerto Cabello, La Guaira, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Buenos Aires, Valparaiso, Callao, and Puerto Bolivar before returning to West Coast ports.In the final series of cruises, departures are scheduled for July 26, Aug. 16, Sept. 6 and 17 and Oct. 18 from Los Angeles. The ships will also call at Vancouver, Tacoma and San Francisco. Though prices for the South American circumnavigations range from about $15,000 and up for the longest journey - beginning in Vancouver and returning there - the line offers less costly programs that include free flights to Rio and Buenos Aires that enable passengers to join the voyages for shorter spans. More information and reservations are available from Delta Line Cruises (101 California Street, Suite 4675, San Francisco, Calif. 94111; 415-777-8300).Cost of Booklet On U.S. Parks Cut to $1.50 If man biting dog is news, so - in this era when most prices seem to be rising - is the slashing, by more than half, of the price of a popular source of tourist information.The source in this case is the 1984 edition of the National Park Service's ''Camping in the National Park System,'' which has been reduced to $1.50, a drop of $2 from the $3.50, price that prevailed in 1983. According to the Department of the Interior, the price reduction is calculated to enable more people to obtain the booklet.The 24-page booklet, providing information on 105 areas in the national park system that offer camping facilities, deals with such matters as fees, visitor regulations, facilities, recreational opportunities, safety, and access for the handicapped.The booklet notes that although most campsites are available on a first-come, first-served basis, a computerized reservations system is in effect, through Ticketron, in Cape Hatteras National Seashore, Acadia, Grand Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains, Rocky Mountain, Sequoia and Kings Canyon, Shenandoah and Yosemite.''Camping in the National Park System,'' which carries the stock number 024-005-00853- 5, is available from the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. An order should bear the stock number, and checks or money orders should be made payable to Superintendent of Documents.Additional information is available from the Office of Public Affairs, National Park Service, Washington, D.C. 20240; 202-343- 7394.On Two Trips, Sign Language Will Tell It All Though guides, escorts and interpreters are common to many tours, there is something out of the ordinary about the interpreters who are scheduled to accompany two journeys later this year - one to Europe, the other to China.Both trips are for the hearing impaired, and the interpreters are sign language interpreters.These trips - a 14-day ''Sights of London, Paris and Brussels'' tour beginning Sept. 27 and a 17-day ''History, Geography and Culture of China'' tour beginning Dec. 27 - are sponsored by the University of Wisconsin- Stout. It is possible to arrange for independent study credits for each tour.The European trip, incorporating visits to great houses and major museums, also includes visits to such essential attractions as Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and the Eiffel Tower. The China tour incorporates visits to Hong Kong, Peking, Shanghai, Xian and Guangzhou as well as the Great Wall and an assortment of palaces, temples, pagodas, gardens and museums.Based on departure from Chicago, the European tour is priced at $1,695. Included are round-trip air fare, accommodations, admission fees, daily Continental breakfasts and some dinners, transfers and luggage handling.Based on departure from Chicago, the China tour is priced at $2,695, including round-trip air fare, accommodations, three meals a day in China and daily American breakfasts at other times, as well as admission, guide fees and transportation between cities.More details are available from the Office of Continuing Education and Summer Session, University of Wisconsin-Stout, Room 227, Menomonie, Wisc. 54751; 800-45-STOUT or, within Wisconsin, 800-22-STOUT.Change of Pace at MealtimeMrs. Leslie-Melville and her late husband were in the safari business, and lodgings at Giraffe House are available to vacationers in Kenya and to participants in safaris operated by Percival Tours, which Mrs. Leslie-Melville serves as director for African affairs.Giraffe Manor accommodates as many as 10 guests and has furniture and paintings from the home of the Leslie-Melvilles' former neighbor, Karen Blixen, better known as Isak Dinesen. The home is on 15 acres adjacent to a wildlife sanctuary.Accommodations at Giraffe Manor are priced at $160 a day, including all meals and tea. Special safaris, focused on the scenery and wildlife of Kenya, are 18 days long. The next one is planned for the fall, probably November. It will include a reception at the home of the Duke and Duchess of Manchester and meetings with local dignitaries. These trips are priced at $2,650, plus air fare; the current APEX fare is $1,360 from New York. Expense arising from lodging at Giraffe Manor is regarded as a charitable deduction to the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife, according to Mrs. Leslie-Melville.Further details are available from Percival Tours Inc., (1 Tandy Center Plaza, Fort Worth, Tex. 76102; 817-870-0300, or, from outside Texas, 800-433-5656).NO CREDITIn Kenya, giraffes sometimes stop by to say hello.All Aboard the Silver Fern!In the offing is a 25-day railroad tour of New Zealand that combines the machinery and trappings of trains and the scenery and cultural attractions that generally appeal to tourists.Railroading fans will have an opportunity to ride aboard crack passenger and freight trains, including the Silver Fern, the Southerner and the Kingston Flyer, one of the last regularly scheduled steam engine passenger trains in the Western world. Among other highlights are visits to six railway museums, inspections of steam engines at the New Zealand Railways' main engine shops, a chance to see logging trains, a ride through the 5.75-mile Kaimai Tunnel and a climb up the Raurimu Spiral.From a scenic and cultural standpoint, the tour - beginning Nov. 9 and ending Dec. 3 - includes both the North and South Islands, with stops at Rotorua, a center of Maori culture, the Waitomo glowworm caves, Milford Sound, Mount Cook, Lake Manapouri and a dozen cities from Auckland and Christchurch to Queenstown and Wellington.Escorting the tour will be Roger Stanton, the deputy travel commissioner for the New Zealand Tourist Office in Brisbane, Australia, who has a longtime association with many of New Zealand's transport museums.Based on double occupancy, the 1984 Rail Fans Tour of New Zealand is priced at $986 a person, including all hotel accommodations, airport transfers, breakfast, admissions and transportation within New Zealand by plane, train, bus and ferry. International air fare - $1,300 round trip between New York and Auckland if a ticket is bought 21 days before departure - is not included.More information is available from the New Zealand Tourist Office, Rail Fans Tour (630 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10111; 212-586-0060).Stained glass window at the Dunedin station."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/07/us/television-captioning-for-deaf-to-increase.html", "headline": "Television Captioning For Deaf to Increase", "date": "1984-07-07T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 7, 1984, Section 1, Page 44Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

What is unusual about Jennifer Schwartzberg, who enrolled in third- year French and Spanish when she matriculated here last September, is that she is deaf. Miss Schwartzberg, who plans to major in Romance languages and linguistics, was a straight-A student at her high school in Evanston, Ill., and has been described by her Princeton professors as ''phenomenal,'' ''very upbeat'' and ''a fighter.'' Last fall, she received a B in French 207 (Studies in French Language and Style) and a Bx in Spanish 207 (Studies in Spanish Language and Style).''I think I inherited a knack for languages from my parents,'' Miss Schwartzberg said in an interview. ''Because I've always been learning English, I have the memory of that experience to help me with French and Spanish.'' Born with a loss of 110 decibels in each ear, Miss Schwartzberg is ''profoundly deaf,'' in the clinical definition. She has worn a hearing aid in each ear since she was 8 months old, thus enabling her to hear undistinguishable noise. Until she was 7, Miss Schwartzberg participated in a special program for deaf children. She attended a Montessori school from age 2 until she turned 14, and then the private Roycemore School in Evanston, 35 minutes by train from her home in Chicago. Except for her distinct voice, it is hard to tell that Miss Schwartzberg is deaf. If one says something while she is facing away and cannot see the speaker's lips, she will turn and ask the person to repeat what was said. And the hearing aids and auditory training allow her not only to discern the human voice, but also to enjoy music and hear a knock at the door or the ring of a telephone. Because Miss Schwartzberg's mother decided she wanted her daughter to be able to mix with people and not be isolated, she was never taught sign language. Instead, she concentrated on learning to speak, and is particularly good at pronouncing the hard consonants. The decision to come to Princeton was a tough one for Miss Schwartzberg, not because it did not have a special college for the deaf but because she had to choose from among Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Vassar, Bryn Mawr and Northwestern, all of which offered her admission. Miss Schwartzberg had some unhappy times last semester. But the problems, she said, were those typical of any college freshman: ''Settling in and adjusting, being alone for one of the very few times in my life.'' The university installed a doorbell outside Miss Schwartzberg's dormitory that activates a light inside the room when pushed, and helped arrange for notetakers. But accommodating her has not presented any major problems, according to a college official.''She comes to me at the beginning of the semester to get advice on selecting courses, and that's it,'' said Nancy Fehsenfeld, director of studies at Mathey College, the residential college to which Miss Schwartzberg belongs. Following a discussion in a classroom situation has been Miss Schwartzberg's major problem. ''It's very difficult to follow a group discussion,'' she said. ''There are all these people trying to talk, and I have to learn to see who's talking. I can use my hearing aid to locate the direction of the voice, but there may be several people sitting in that direction.'' It also is difficult for Miss Schwartzberg to participate in oral exercises in a language class. Andre Maman, her French instructor last semester, said that others had trouble understanding her, but that in a one- on-one conversation she understood him and he her. Miss Schwartzberg was originally placed in a class a level below French 207, Mr. Maman's course. She was moved up to his class three weeks after the semester started. ''I was amazed to see how fast she caught up,'' Mr. Maman said. ''She has a tremendous capacity for working on her own.'' Miss Schwartzberg took the equivalent of four years of French in high school, including one summer of independent study. She also took the equivalent of four years of Spanish in high school and a fifth, during her senior year, at Northwestern University. ''I'm not fluent in either Spanish or French,'' she said, ''but I learned to speak them a lot easier than I did English. I found Spanish easy to pronounce. Spanish sounds like it's written.'' Although she has difficulty pronouncing the nasals in French, Miss Schwartzberg finds the language easier to understand than Spanish. ''Native Spanish speakers speak fast, and words flow into each other,'' she said, ''and it's hard to pick up individual words. French is more clearly enunciated, so I can pick it up easier.'' This semester, Miss Schwartzberg is taking a course in French literature and one in Spanish prose and poetry. To pursue her major interest in historical linguistics, she said, she will eventually have to take Latin and German, too. She also would like to spend her junior year abroad, with one semester in France and the other in Spain.Mr. Maman believes that Miss Schwartzberg will have little difficulty pursuing her interest. ''She has a tremendous will,'' he said. ''If it's something that's physically possible, she will do it.'' Being deaf has given Miss Schwartzberg no social problems at Princeton, she said. She sometimes has to tell people to look at her when they speak so that she can read their lips. Earlier in the school year, a dimly lit dining room was making it difficult for her to ''hear'' dinner companions. College officials have since turned up the lights. Fellow students are not intimidated by her handicap, Miss Schwartzberg said. ''I think they don't feel concerned about my handicap because I don't make them feel concerned about it,'' she explained.It helps that Miss Schwartzberg does not seem to consider being deaf a disability. ''It's something I've always had,'' she said, ''so I don't have any self- consciousness about that.'' Miss Schwartzberg also accepts that being deaf is part of her identity. ''If I had not been born deaf,'' she said, ''I would be a very different person. I like the way that I am, so I've never really regretted being born deaf.'' k"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/11/us/hearing-dogs-helping-deaf-people-to-easier-life.html", "headline": "'HEARING DOGS' HELPING DEAF PEOPLE TO EASIER LIFE", "date": "1984-03-11T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 11, 1984, Section 1, Page 53Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

''Luckily, I had a habit of checking the babies constantly.''But life in her Martinsville, N.J., home has changed ever since Mrs. Stopinski, who is deaf, acquired one of the more sophisticated hearing aids available: a certified hearing dog.With Drummer, a Welsh corgi, at her side, Mrs. Stopinski no longer worries that the episode will repeat itself. ''We have a grandchild,'' she says, ''and I feel so much more at ease baby-sitting because Drummer answers the baby's cries immediately.'' 2,000 Have Been PlacedAbout 2,000 dogs have been trained to assist the deaf, much as guide dogs have long acted as eyes for the blind. Each year as many as 500 dogs are placed with people with hearing impairments by the 20 hearing dog programs that have opened around the country in the last seven years.Depending on an applicant's needs, hearing dogs can learn to recognize numerous household sounds. The standard repertory includes a smoke detector, a telephone, an alarm clock, a doorbell, and possibly an owner's name. Sheena, the small tawny mongrel helping Hannah Merker, who lives on 40-foot houseboat in Huntington Harbor, L.I., can also detect the thumping of a stray rowboat, a leaky water pump, thunderclouds, and the squawking of swans.The animals communicate through eye contact, body language, and touch. Or they simply run between a person and the source of the sound. Tales of canine heroism abound, but the animals help most simply by enabling their guardians to overcome everyday problems. A Canine Alarm ClarkLike many deaf workers, Ann McCluskey once had trouble getting to her morning shift on time. Unable to use an alarm clock, Mrs. McCluskey had to rely on poor substitutes like a pulsing light, a bed vibrator, and a husband who was away a lot.But now, before Mrs. McCluskey goes to work at a New Hampshire shipyard where she is an inspector, her dog, Maggie, goes to work: The silver and black Norwegian elkhound has the reponsibility of rousing her promptly at 4:30.Once trained, the dogs take their work very seriously.''There's no snooze alarm,'' says Carolyn Bird. ''These dogs won't stop until they're sure their masters are awake.'' She runs Red Acre Farm in Stow, Mass., one of four training centers that serve the Northeast. Companionship a BonusIn addition to reliability, the dogs provide something electronic devices cannot. ''One of the most fantastic benefits we've seen,'' says Ralph Denard, director of a San Francisco program, ''is the feeling that some of these people get from having a companion.''The programs typically give preference to adults with severe to profound hearing losses who live alone or with other hearing-impaired people. The average hearing dog costs $5,000, but recipients usually get the animals free of charge.In many cases, the working animals mean a deaf adult's first taste of independence in a long time.And long after their arrival, the dogs continue to make themselves useful in unexpected ways. Some have detected prowlers. Still others retrieve keys and wallets that would be lost because the usual clinks and clunks go unnoticed. Tough Screening and TrainingCanine candidates undergo extensive screening. Trainers rate their intelligence, curiosity, disposition, fitness and, of course, hearing. Priority goes to animals between the ages of 6 and 18 months, so that they have a full 10 years of service ahead of them.Training lasts about four months, and upon completion, these dogs differ vastly from their Seeing Eye cousins. For one thing, they foster independence inside the home more than outside. And unlike guide dogs who work only when harnessed, hearing dogs never know where and when duty may call. Finally, they come in all shapes, sizes and pedigrees.''Mostly, we like mixed breeds,'' says Sheila O'Brien of the Hearing Ear Dog program in West Boylston, Mass. ''We just feel they're hardier.''At the Red Acre Farm in Stow, the dogs practice in a homelike setting on a converted farm, with a couple of cats on hand to teach the dogs how to handle distractions. A symphony of doorbells, babies' cries and home security systems, some taped in prospective owners' homes, plays in the background. ''You'd be surprised,'' says Pam Bundy, the trainer, ''how many different smoke alarms and doorbells there are.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/09/nyregion/new-yzrk-day-by-day-sign-language-gives-clear-signal-amid-the-din.html", "headline": " Sign Language Gives Clear Signal Amid the Din", "date": "1984-03-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 9, 1984, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

No one can hear the details amid the din of the American Stock Exchange in full cry, but everyone understands the hand signals, communicating orders to people on the trading floor below.While electronics dominate in computerized ticker tapes, electronic Quotron machines and other gadgets, the hand-signal system remains an endearing anachronism. It dates from the mid-19th century, when the market operated on the sidewalks and clerks in open windows relayed orders to brokers in the streets.''It's the deaf sign language, slightly modified,'' explained L. William Alter Jr., an exchange member. ''The number of fingers designates amounts, modified by the direction of the hand.''The clerks get the attention of brokers on the floor by shouting. Then, in sign language, the clerks give the symbol for the stock, whether to buy or sell, the number of shares and the price. Further gesticulations on the type of stock follow.Apparently, this antiquated system works faster than computers, and here, time is money. Mr. Alter says few errors are made with this silent language. ''If you're going to use it, you'd better know it.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/26/us/surgeons-to-start-implanting-electronic-device-to-aid-deaf.html", "headline": "SURGEONS TO START IMPLANTING ELECTRONIC DEVICE TO AID DEAF", "date": "1984-02-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 26, 1984, Section 1, Page 26Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The Food and Drug Administration approved the implants Tuesday.Researchers say they hope to have the device widely available. The device translates sounds into electronic signals that can be interpreted by the brain.The researchers say it might eventually help victims of cochlear disease, which affects the deep, snailshell-shaped part of the inner ear, the cochlea. Those with cochlear disease make up 65 percent of the nation's 250,000 to 500,000 people who have no hearing in either ear, Dr. Parkin said.The first of the 20 patients will be a Salt Lake City man in his 30's, the doctor said. The device costs $10,000 and the surgery about $7,000, but the first two patients will be treated free, he said. Requirements for CandidatesHe said candidates must be deaf adults who once could hear. Adults who were born deaf and children may be candidates later.Preliminary versions of the device have been implanted in four people in the past eight years, but approval by the food and drug agency was required under new laws for the 20 implants, Dr. Parkin said. ''We're very excited about this because of results obtained in patients that were implanted years ago,'' he said.When the patients are blindfolded, he said, they have 60 to 80 percent comprehension of spoken words, and their understanding is almost 100 percent when they can watch the speaker's lips.In a normal ear, sound waves travel to the cochlea, which converts them into electronic signals that are transmitted to the brain. The artificial ear is ''like taking the cochlea outside the head and putting it on your belt,'' Dr. Parkin said.Eight electrodes connected to a plug are implanted in the patient's ear, six of them in the cochlea, in a two-hour operation. The wires are laced through an opening above the natural ear, where the plug is attached with screws to the skull. Converter on Patient's BeltResearchers have developed a microprocessor pack that can be worn on a person's belt and connected by a cord to the plug above the ear. Sound waves enter the device through a tiny microphone attached to the ear and travel down the cord into the pack to be converted into electronic signals.The signals then travel into the ear, where the electrodes stimulate nerve endings in the cochlea and transmit the signals to the brain.Of the four patients who previously had implants, two still are using the ear, one has died and one has had the device removed because he is impaired only in one ear and was used only to aid the research, Dr. Parkin said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/18/nyregion/the-city-lawyer-rejects-deaf-man-as-juror.html", "headline": " Lawyer Rejects Deaf Man as Juror", "date": "1984-02-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 18, 1984, Section 1, Page 27Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The National Theater of the Deaf, based in Chester, has been selected by the Los Angeles Olympics Organizing Committee to be one of six American theater companies to perform at the International Olympic Arts Festival next summer on the campus of U.C.L.A.The event is planned to celebrate and complement the Olympic Games. Theater, music and dance companies from the United States and abroad will participate in the festival, which will run from June 1 through Aug. 12.The National Theater of the Deaf will stage its 1983-84 production, ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces,'' from July 3 to 7.The group is made up of a dozen actors, only two of whom can hear. In its performances, the company blends body movement and sign language with the spoken word.''It adds depth and excitement,'' said the artistic director, David Hays, ''when the audience can both see and hear a word at the same moment.''''We're very proud to be selected for the Olympics,'' he said. ''We're an American touring company that has been to every state and has been abroad more than most companies. We represent a minority: the deaf. The way we do our work - speaking clearly in the beautiful language of signs - isn't parochial. It's internationally understood.''Mr. Hays added that the group is launching a campaign to raise $14,000 to take the company to Los Angeles. That amount represents approximately a third of the cost of the trip. The rest will be paid by the Olympic Organizing Committee.The company raises $200,000 annually, to augment its income from grants and performance fees, he added.Since its founding in 1967 by Mr. Hays, who said he fended such questions as, ''Theater of the what?,'' the group has given over 3,000 stage performances, produced television specials and won a Tony Award in 1977. Its productions have included tragedies, farces, an opera and a radio show.''The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' is directed by Larry Arrick, who adapted it from Joseph Campbell's book about the myths and dreams of mankind.Television viewers around the country got a brief glimpse of this play in September, when the National Theater of the Deaf was featured on ''The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.'' The work features a story that appears over and over, in different times and cultures: The hero, called by a herald, goes on a journey. He fights a battle and returns victorious.''It's a very Olympian theme,'' said Mr. Hays.Mr. Hays announced the theater's selection by the Olympic Organizing Committee last week at the Hazel E. Stark Center, the group's home in Chester. There he asked the actor Adrian Blue to sign a passage from ''Thousand Faces'' as the actress Chita Rivera interpreted. Mr. Blue's hands and Miss Rivera's voice delivered: ''We do not risk the adventure alone; the heroes of all time have gone before us . . . And where we thought to be alone, we shall be with all mankind.''Originally housed at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, the group moved to Chester last summer. The two 19th-century buildings of the Stark Center were purhased and renovated with a $250,000 gift from Irving Stark, a retired businessman from East Norwalk, as a memorial to his late wife, Hazel. In the summer, the buildings are headquarters for the group's school for deaf theater personnel.In the past week, theater members returned to Chester from their fall tour, which included performances in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.This winter, the troupe will split into two ''Little Theater of the Deaf'' casts, to perform for children. In the spring, the entire company will tour the southeastern United States, appear at the Cervantes Festival in Mexico City, and perform in Europe before heading for Los Angeles.Speaking through interpreters, several actors noted their excitement at being invited to the Olympic Festival.''I always wanted to go to the Olympics just to watch - as a fan,'' said Mr. Blue. ''But to be there performing is an awesome thing.''The actor Nat Wilson, who explained that ''Thousand Faces'' was about people's dreams, smiled. ''For us to go to the Olympics,'' he said, ''is like another dream.''Other American theater companies that will perform at the Olympic Festival are the American Repertory Theater from Boston, the Goodman Theater from Chicago, the Negro Ensemble Company from New York City and Antenna Theater and Nightfire, both from San Francisco."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/nyregion/program-aids-the-hearing-impaired.html", "headline": "PROGRAM AIDS THE HEARING IMPAIRED", "date": "1983-09-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from September 18, 1983, Section 11CN, Page 20Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

But West Hartford is the only school system in the state that provides academic programs for adults who are deaf or hearing-impaired. The classes, offered through the school system's Adult Education Program, can lead to a general education degree, which is equivalent to a high school diploma. There are also courses for self-enrichment, such as physical education and crafts.Students come from as far as Bridgeport in southwestern Connecticut, Ledyard in eastern Connecticut and Morris in northwestern Connecticut to take the Saturday morring courses.One student, a craftsman from Morris, has always had his father do his bookkeeping for him.''He is going back to school to learn the basics, to take over his own life,'' explained Douglas Christie, director of continuing education in West Hartford.Other hearing-impaired students in the program include a wheelchair- bound cerebral palsy victim and an 18-year-old who spent years in a mental institution, incorrectly diagnosed as being retarded.''A couple of people in the program were told by their employers that if they could improve their reading and writing, they will receive promotions,'' Mr. Christie said. ''They cannot progress in the jobs they are in without basic skills.''About 20,000 of the hearing-impaired people in the state are considered deaf, according to R. Catharine Nash, program coordinator for the State Commission on the Deaf and Hearing Impaired. Of the deaf adults who have attended regular schools, ''it is generally assumed that they have approximately fourth-grade reading levels,'' she said.A number of deaf and hearing-impaired people are weak in basic skills, Mr. Christie said, and this ''hinders them not only from a personal perspective, but vocationally, it hinders their opportunities for a good job situation.''He noted that hearing-impaired people generally have a difficult time grasping language arts.''Evidently, the fact that you do not hear the language intensifies the difficulty of learning the language,'' he said. He added that ''an important social dimension of the classes is being with others you can communicate with.''The West Hartford program, which began in the 1981-82 school year with a Federal grant, offers classes in basic skills, particularly English, mathematics and science. Noncredit courses are offered to deaf and hearing-impaired people in needlepoint and physical fitness. Hearing and hearing-impaired students take classes such as aerobics and creative dough-art jointly, because the teachers know sign language.At present, the basic education classes are financed 63 percent by the city and 37 percent by the state. The noncredit courses are financed primarily through tuition. By law, a school system cannot charge any fees to handicapped people enrolled in adult education programs, according to Lorraine Aronson, chief of the legal affairs office in the State Department of Education.Mr. Christie pointed out that the West Hartford classes serve only a fraction of the hearing-impaired community in Connecticut. Last year, for example, 20 people were enrolled in the basic education workshops, and 29 took the physical education and needlepoint classes. Numbers for classes that served both hearing and hearing- impaired adults were not available.He speculated that funding problems probably prevent other communities from offering such programs.Mr. Christie said that the West Hartford program will expand in the upcoming school year to include an evening class one night a week. He added that his town has videotaped classes for other municipalities to use if they are interested in starting courses for the hearing impaired. However, he reported that no requests have been made."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/24/nyregion/school-for-the-deaf-marking-centennial.html", "headline": "SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF MARKING CENTENNIAL", "date": "1983-07-24T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 24, 1983, Section 11, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

It will be held at the Hilton Inn in East Windsor Township Thursday and Friday and at the school on Saturday.The New Jersey School for the Deaf, as it was known until 1965, was renamed the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf in honor of the late president of the State Board of Education. She took a special interest in the education of the handicapped.Using the sign language and other communication skills that they learned there, most of the returning alumni will recall life at the Katzenbach School's 118-acre suburban campus of homelike dormitories, rolling lawns and spacious playing fields.However, members of the pioneer class of 1883 left their homes and families in various parts of the state to sleep, eat, attend classes and play in a single, rambling old building just a short walk from Trenton's railroad depot.The building, described in an 1883 report as ''originally rather cheaply built and, in some part, in a dilapidated condition,'' was formerly an orphanage for children of Civil War soldiers.The state renovated and refurnished the 200-foot-long, three-story structure before the first pupils, aged 5 to 21, moved in. Some had previously attended schools in neighboring states at their parents' expense.The Katzenbach School, which moved to its present West Trenton location in 1926, currently has an enrollment of 420 students, most of whom board there. They attend classes during the traditional school year at no expense to their parents, and spend weekends, summers and holidays at home with their families.Primarily an academic institution that teaches youngsters from nursery-school age through high school, Katzenbach also evaluates, counsels and treats deaf children with learning disabilities and multiple handicaps.A deaf-blind unit established in 1979 has an enrollment of nearly 20 adolescents. About 44 percent of Katzenbach's graduates go on to post-secondary education, many to Gallaudet College in Washington, a liberal-arts institution for the deaf. Others pursue careers based on the vocational training that the school provides in graphic arts, horticulture and 24 other occupations.Using a concept called ''total communication,'' which employs appropriate manual, oral and aural means (sign language, speech and use of residual hearing) throughout the school, Katzenbach also works with infants and toddlers on a part-time basis.''Most of the school's population right now is in the high school because mainstreaming becomes more difficult at that age,'' said James R. LeBuffe, superintendent, referring to the practice of educating handicapped children in their local public schools.''They transfer to Katzenbach because of problems encountered in circulating among several teachers a day while using interpreters. They want a comprehensive program tailored to their needs, including sports and a social life with their peers.''Marie Hilson Katzenbach was born the year before the school that bears her name was opened. She served on the State Board of Education for 43 years and under seven Governors, and was instrumental in the planning of the new campus, beginning in 1921.Often referred to as ''New Jersey's first lady of education,'' Mrs. Katzenbach became the state board's first woman president (in 1956). She was a trustee of Rutgers, the State University, for many years, and a dormitory at Douglass College there was also named for her.Both of Marie Katzenbach's sons held Federal posts in the 1960's. Nicholas deB. Katzenbach was United States Attorney General and Edward Katzenbach was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense.Larry Forestal, principal of the Millburn School for the Deaf, one of several regional day schools throughout the state, is chairman of the alumni program this week."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/09/us/quest-for-help-for-the-hard-of-hearing.html", "headline": "QUEST FOR HELP FOR THE HARD OF HEARING", "date": "1983-07-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 9, 1983, Section 1, Page 4Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

For four years Mr. Stone and his staff of four full-time volunteers have been building an organization capable of dealing with the problems of the 15.7 million Americans who suffer from loss of hearing but are not classified as deaf.''You have a National Eye Institute, one of the 11 National Institutes of Health, but we have no National Ear Institute,'' Mr. Stone said, ''so that when you fill out your I.R.S. form, you see one disability mentioned there, and that's blindness.''''That's not because the I.R.S. thinks that blindness is the worst disability,'' he went on. ''It's because the blind have been very effective in articulating their problem and acquiring the kind of assistance that they need.''Concern and AwarenessSelf Help for Hard of Hearing People is an example of how a group of concerned, politically aware citizens can begin evolving into a lobby. ''The only way to have an effective lobby,'' Mr. Stone said, ''is to have a healthy and educated constituency. Only then can we jump into the area of advocacy.''Other officials of the organization said their main purpose at the moment was to gain recognition and raise funds, and then to move into Congressional lobbying.As the president of an upstart nonprofit organization amid Washington's multitude of well-financed and well-established foundations and institutes, Mr. Stone, a 58-year-old retired Government employee, has kept Self Help afloat with dedication and luck.''In 1979, when I started work on this thing, I had two choices to make,'' said Mr. Stone. ''I could either search for financing and then start work, or I could just start and let the money take care of itself. I chose the latter, and though we're always broke, we've been helping people from Day One.''The organization's headquarters is a five-room Washington office filled with homemade desks and makeshift file cabinets. Two typewriters and a copier are on loan. ''Once a month I go to a law firm and beg for supplies,'' said Mr. Stone, pointing to a small pile of paper for the copying machine. ''I hate to beg, but sometimes you have to do it.'' Relying on Fees and DonationsWith all this, Self Help, founded in 1979, has developed a membership of close to 10,000 people and is still supported solely by private donations and its $7-a-year membership fee.The immediate goal, Mr. Stone said, remains the education of the afflicted and the general public alike about the problems of those with impaired hearing.''A good deal of attention is being paid to deaf people, and that's very important - they need that attention,'' Mr. Stone said. ''But the area of hearing loss was not considered to be a problem, and not too many people paid much attention to it.''Since he was 19 years old Mr. Stone has been considered ''functionally deaf,'' though he can distinguish tones. He says most people have difficulty coming to terms with hearing loss and that the special problems of the hard of hearing have gone largely unnoticed by the Government and the public. Fear, Stigma and Isolation''When you lose your hearing you begin to withdraw,'' he said. ''People are so afraid of losing their hearing and the stigma that goes along with it that they refuse to admit to themselves and to others that they have a problem.''''Pretty soon, they are living in isolation, and that's a terrible way to live out the last 20 or 30 years of your life.'' One of his assistants is Pat Clickener, a hearing-impaired former vice president of a Chicago advertising agency. ''We are trying to make people aware of the fact that they are not alone, that many people have this problem,'' she said. ''We want people to help themselves, but they can't do that until they know that there are others like them.''For their $7 yearly dues, members receive a journal, ''Shhh,'' the acronym for the organization's title. The journal publishes stories about people who have overcome their handicap, general news about the membership of Shhh and the latest news about hearing aids and medical treatment. Working on the Local LevelAlong with the magazine, the organization makes efforts to set up local chapters so that members can meet and discuss mutual problems. ''It's a means of letting people know that gradually you get this thing into perspective, and that you haven't lost your humanness - you've just lost your hearing,'' Mr. Stone said.''We're never going to change society's attitude until enough of us stand together and start doing something about it.'' he went on. ''The area of research is quite inadequate, and that's because those of us with the problem, despite our large numbers, have never banded together and demanded that kind of research.''''We don't want to insist that society adapt to us, because we have the problem,'' he said. ''We want to do as much as we can for ourselves first. We want to tell people that when you lose your hearing, it's not the end.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/03/nyregion/garden-created-for-deafblind.html", "headline": "GARDEN CREATED FOR DEAF-BLIND", "date": "1983-07-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 3, 1983, Section 11, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The surfacing materials vary in texture and form from one area to another, so that the deaf and blind clients may learn their way about by sensing these differences. Paths of coarse-textured bricks connect patios or sitting areas surfaced with smooth concrete, pebbletextured patio blocks or bluestone slabs.An area in the center of the garden consists of raised redwood planters sited among coarse pebbles. Sturdy benches beneath the lacy foliage of honey locust trees provide a pleasant place to sit and take in the surrounding fragrances.Planting beds line the walkways and patios. Steel posts connected by smooth plastic chains lead visitors along the edge of the plantings and allow them to find the labels, in both printing and Braille, that identify the plants, which may be touched.Raised planters are also planted with a variety of fragrant or textured plants, making this one of the few sensory gardens planted on more than one level. So that people may wash the confusing mixture of accumulated fragrances from their hands before trying others, a large redwood fountain is situated in the middle of the garden.Among the fragrant plants in the garden, which is open to the public, are Korean spice viburnum, sweet shrub, rose, juniper, clove pink, lavender, bee balm, santolina, yarrow, sweet alyssum, sage, rosemary, marigold and chive. On a warm day, people sitting on the benches can smell the spicy fragrance of the clove pink or the pungent odor of the juniper.A variety of textures that may be easily sensed by touch is provided by soft, woolly lamb's ears, prickly juniper, waxy boxwood, Japanese holly and soft-textured yews.Under the lead of Virginia Klumpp, the club's horticultural chairman, Herbert Cohen, professor of landscape design at the State University of New York at Farmingdale, was chosen as the landscape architect. The firm of Goldberg & Rodler of Huntington was retained as landscape contractor.The selection of appropriate plants was often complex. Knowing that the old rose varieties are usually the most fragrant, Johanna Buerger sought out a nursery in California, one of the few that still propagate such roses, to obtain the best varieties.Helen Bachko, chairman of the project, reported that 80 percent of the $50,000 required for the project was raised by one letter mailed to community residents. The other 20 percent was raised in a similar manner in nearby communities and from former residents. Fund-raising costs were more than met by the interest earned on the money while awaiting completion of the garden.The garden club members did much of the planting and have continued to attend to the weeding, grooming and watering. The Helen Keller National Center was created by an Act of Congress and was dedicated in 1976. Financed by the Federal Government, it is operated by the Industrial Home for the Blind. Through its headquarters in Sands Point and eight regional offices throughout the country, the center helps those who are both deaf and blind to learn skills to enable them to communicate, get about and become more independent. In addition, the center provides pre-vocational skills.Adjacent to the sensory garden is a Square Foot vegetable garden that is tended by the clients as a part of the hortitherapy program. Both Martin Adler, director of the center, and Barbara Hausman, assistant director of community education, stressed the importance of the vocational aspects of this program.Under the supervision of Madeline Cohen, horticultural specialist, clients are taught to transplant and water in the nearby greenhouse as well as to tend the outdoor plantings. They are encouraged to care for plants in their own rooms."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/18/theater/parzival-staged-by-and-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "'PARZIVAL' STAGED BY AND FOR THE DEAF", "date": "1983-03-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 18, 1983, Section C, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

He is kept in seclusion by his mother, who fears that if he sees a knight, he will be tempted to become one and will eventually die in combat. One day, however, some knights pass through the forest, and Parzival is indeed enthralled. He follows them and eventually becomes a knight, but he must face many severe tests - encounters with beasts, knights and women - before he becomes a truly strong man.This weekend, at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn, the story of Parzival, based on the work by Wolfram von Eschenbach, will be performed by the National Theater of the Deaf. From time to time, the actors will break away from the story to give short, speeches based on their own experiences as deaf children growing up in a hearing world.In their stories, called ''personal quest speeches,'' the actors appear as modern-day Parzivals, children who began life in a secluded wood and who now hunger for, are hurt by and laugh at the lessons of experience. Dual-Language StyleAs always, the company's players will perform in what they call the dual-language style. In this style, a cast of deaf actors plays its roles using the sign language of the deaf, while a cast of speaking actors simultaneously translates in a speaking voice.''Sign language amplifies the power and deep sense of the spoken word,'' said Carole Addabbo, an actress in the troupe. ''Our motto is that you see and hear every word, and, by God, you do. There is power in that.''In one ''personal quest speech,'' a deaf actor tells how his Lithuanian immigrant parents, when they learned that their child was deaf, decided they would never have to learn English -and never did. And a deaf actress remembers her father, who recently died: ''He was my music teacher, boat captain, homework helper, listener, my unshakable center,'' she says. ''When Daddy went up, I lost my doorway into your world.''The National Theater of the Deaf was founded in 1967 by David Hays, a set designer, who had worked on Broadway, and in Britain at the Old Vic. He was inspired by a production of ''Our Town'' at Gallaudet College, a college for the deaf in Washington. With a grant from from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, he was able to start a company and take it on its first United States tour in the fall of 1967. Score of Troupes FormedSince then, the company has toured the country more than 30 times and inspired the founding of scores of deaf-theater companies. The National Theater of the Deaf is often credited with removing the stigma from sign language and spurring its frequent use by the deaf, outside of their homes, on television and in public ceremonies.In the company's early days, Mr. Hays said, a major challenge was to make sign language suitable for use on the stage. Just as there are differences between everyday speech and the use of the human voice on stage, so must sign language be altered to help achieve theatrical effects. The differences mainly concern the enlarging of movements to be seen at a distance and the improvising of movements to provide shadings of meaning.In one scene in ''Parzival,'' for example, an actor playing a hawk dives onto a rabbit, clutches it and flies away. The sign for hawk is a crooked first finger held at the mouth, followed by the more general sign for bird, which is two hands coupled at the thumbs and waving. This sign is altered, during the bird's dive, to become two waving arms. Then, as the bird flies away, the actor makes the signlanguage symbol for bird with two hands and then with just six fingers, four fingers and finally two fingers waving in the distance. Interview by TelexShanny Mow, a 45-year-old playwright, worked with David Hays on the script of ''Parzival.'' At the age of 5, Mr. Mow lost his hearing after a meningitis attack. His parents were Chinese, and he never heard spoken English before he became deaf.In an interview conducted by means of a Telex machine (like the interview with Miss Addabbo), Mr. Mow said that he had worked as a teacher of deaf students and a freelance photgrapher before joining the National Theater of the Deaf in 1979.''I was one of those people who wanted to do the Great American Novel, but never got around to it,'' Mr. Mow wrote on the Telex. ''I am interested in universal themes. I do not consider myself a deaf playwright in the sense of a black writer, etc. I will probably write a deaf play because it is within my experience, but I am most concerned with storytelling.''When he is writing a play, Mr. Mow said, he often asks hearing friends, ''if this word or phrase sounds natural.'' A secondary concern, he said, is how the word will look when it is put into sign language. ''There are several ways to sign the same word, so I write what I damn please, and trust actors to come up with the proper selection.'' Getting to the CoreThe process of finding the correct sign for a word, according to Miss Addabbo, comes out of long discussions, in which ''we try to get to the core and depth of what the words mean.'' She continued: ''Then we try to create this same essence in sign language. What we want to do is stay true to the script, which is every actor's job.''After the basic signs are found, Miss Addabbo said, the actors try to find the proper inflections for the words. While a spoken word is inflected mainly by tone of voice, she said, the actor using sign language has facial expressions, posture and body movements to bring more precise meanings to a word.There will be two performances of ''Parzival,'' tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday night at 7. Tickets are $8; $5 each for groups of 10 or more. The Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity is at the corner of Clinton and Montague Streets in Brooklyn.

A light attached to the console indicates that the call requires the use of special equipment. She places the receiver in a cradle extension, and types on the phone keyboard: ''Office for the Disabled. This is September Polk. May I help you? - GA (Go Ahead).''The message from the caller appears on the console screen, followed by the letters, GA - the signal that tells Miss Polk that it is her turn to respond. She conveys the information the caller needs and concludes the call. The telecommunication device is only one way in which this county office is able to aid and inform the hearing impaired of Westchester.''Many people in the world today find deafness mystifying,'' said Miss Polk, who is not hearing impaired. ''Throughout history, people have associated the inability to hear and speak clearly with a lack of intelligence. Even the legendary Aristotle declared that 'if one has no speech, one has no soul.' The deaf feel that they must constantly disprove the notion that they are mentally impaired. Some fight actively to dispel that belief.''In an effort to aid people who were vocationally trained before their hearing loss, the Westchester Hearing Impaired Association was set up under the auspices of the Office for the Disabled. Originally the group was made up of people 40 to 75 years old. The original six members began meeting to discuss the personal problems they encountered with deafness. The group grew in size and more services were added. There are now 250 families and individual members on the mailing list - some of whom are young adults and parents of deaf children.''The large group accommodates some of the people some of the time'' Miss Polk said. ''However, the needs of the hard of hearing and the profoundly deaf as well as the needs of those who are born without hearing, or lost it at a later date are vastly different. The group, therefore, must be divided at times to address the needs of everyone.''Some of the resources available are arranged through the group members themselves. Some are supplied by the Office for the Disabled. Miss Polk leads weekly classes in sign-language training on Thursday mornings. The morning meeting is also a time to discuss problems that group members encounter as hearing impaired.The support that members feel among each other cannot easily be found elsewhere. Discussion one morning centered around one woman's anguish over the recent death of her husband. Having been deaf for more than 10 years, she lost the one person with whom she could clearly communicate. She had been left alone, isolated and dispirited. The group provided comfort, encouragement and friendship. Another woman told the story -well understood by the deaf - of dwindling friendships. Her friends and family had become too busy to talk to her. Although she had learned to read lips, her friends rarely took the time to speak directly to her so that she could distinctly understand them. The group encouraged her to give her friends some guidelines with which to communicate with her. They suggested that she tell them to speak directly to her, to reduce background noise, to speak without shouting and to be sure that bright light is not shining in her eyes. The also advised her to tell them not to chew gum, smoke or put their hands to their faces while talking to her.At other times, group members arrange for captioned film series to be shown at the Greenburgh Public Library, and museum tours with guides who explain art history in sign language. There are monthly open-house gatherings that address the laws involving the disabled, and advocacy for changes. One topic is the expanded use by large corporations, stores and public transportation of the TTY - Telecommunications device. Many large companies, such as American Airlines and Greyhound, have incorporated the device into their communications systems. Miss Polk explained the listing that indicates its availability, with the words ''Voice or TTY.''''Ideally,'' she said, ''Further use of the TTY would dramatically increase the ability of the hearing disabled to contact the rest of the world, and, in so doing, decrease the resistance of the nonhearing impaired to communicate with them.'' Miss Polk added, ''Although we are not an employment agency, we can sometimes place our people in jobs that utilize skills other than hearing. Sears in White Plains has been most cooperative in hiring the hearing disabled. Xerox Corporation is another that has made inroads in the accommodation of all disabled.''Correct job placement for intelligent and skilled people of all types can be difficult. For the hearing impaired, there are additional burdens.Leslie Elion, staff assistant at the Office for the Disabled, became deaf after an infection at the age of 5. Her parents, in trying to help her, encouraged her to ''pass for normal.'' She went to public school, and taught herself to read lips. She fought the stigma attached to her altered mode of speech. ''I wanted to learn sign language,'' she recalled, ''because I wanted a foothold in the deaf world; I never wholly fit into the hearing world.''She graduated from high school with good grades and entered college. Because of her lack of sign-language training and the college's inability to provide further assistance, she was relegated to taking courses in which she could learn the course work from books, and from small seminars, where she could read lips.Encouraged by a friend with a deaf mother, she finally learned sign language. Soon after graduation from college, she joined the Peace Corps in a pilot program that provided rehabilitation to the hearing disabled in the Philippines. Upon her return to the United States, she accepted a job as a dormitory supervisor at a school for the deaf in the South. Miss Elion said, ''I realized how inadequate some states are in providing education and training for the disabled. There is an incredible lack of uniformity between states. Although I take a moderate stance, and I'm not reflecting personal bitterness, I am angered by the lack of regard for the disabled in many areas of this country.''In her job at the Office for the Disabled, Miss Elion uses her skills in developing a simplified and accessible directory for the disabled. The directory lists guides to finance, transportation, national organizations, state agencies, local organizations, communications and religious affiliations.Both Miss Polk and Miss Elion said they sought to encourage the young who are hearing disabled to join in programs, ''We hope to involve members of the Westchester Community College Interpreters Training Program with the hearing disabled students who need interpreters,'' Miss Polk said. ''We plan to involve these people in a group that offers entertainment and sports as well as language skills.''In addition to their work at the office, Miss Polk and Miss Elion do sign interpretation for groups that require their help. Miss Elion teaches sign language to employees at the International Business Machines Corporation and other concerns. Miss Polk does sign-language interpretation at An Evening Dinner Theater in Elmsford at certain performances. Her most-recent sign-language interpretation was of ''Barnum'' on Jan. 16.''There are so many misconceptions about deafness and the hearingimpaired person's ability to participate in our society,'' Miss Polk said. ''With more use of telecommunications devices and closer attention from the general public, the hearing impaired need not feel like pariahs in their own backyards.''To get in touch with September Polk and to become involved in the Westchester Hearing Impaired Association, call 682-3408 - Voice or TTY."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/12/theater/performance-of-evita-to-be-signed-for-deaf.html", "headline": "Performance of 'Evita' To Be Signed for Deaf", "date": "1983-02-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 12, 1983, Section 1, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The law requires only that handicapped children derive ''some educational benefit'' - not necessarily full potential - from their schooling, the Court held.It appeared that Amy Rowley had lost the case and the services of a sign-language interpreter. In fact, the legal issues are still not settled.The case is back in Federal District Court in Manhattan for a ruling on whether the Peekskill school district has complied with the procedural requirements of the Federal act. These call for an impartial hearing to determine the proper educational program for a handicapped child.Amy's parents, Clifford and Nancy Rowley, acting through their attorney, Michael Chatoff of Manhattan, contend that the hearing officer, who ruled out an interpreter for Amy, unfairly favored the school district."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/15/business/patents-classroom-signals-for-deaf-students.html", "headline": "PATENTS;\nClassroom Signals For Deaf Students", "date": "1983-01-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 15, 1983, Section 1, Page 39Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Except for math, Karen's grades do not reflect the fact that she has been identified as gifted, with an I.Q. of 140.But she will never be quite like the 1,100 other students at Lewis and Clark Junior High School in Omaha. Along with an estimated 410,000 children in the United States age 18 and under, Karen is deaf.Last summer, she and 26 other deaf children from seven Middle Western states came to Boys Town, Neb., to participate in an annual four-week learning program designed to stimulate the potential in gifted deaf children. The program was created by Dr. Patricia Sullivan, a psychologist at the Boys Town National Institute for Communication Disorders in Children here, and by the associate director of media development project for the hearing impaired at the University of Nebraska, Dr. George Propp, who is himself deaf.'' If gifted children are one of our most valuable resources,'' Dr. Sullivan said, ''then those found within a handicapped population are priceless.''Karen's parents called the change in their daughter since she attended the program ''fantastic.'' ''She went away a little girl and returned a young lady,'' said her father, Stanley Maliszewski. ''She used to be extremely shy. She's been deaf since birth and her speech is very difficult to understand. It was a battle just to get her to say 'Hi' to someone she didn't know well. Now she's more assertive and self-confident.''The Summer Program for Gifted Hearing-Impaired Youth is held at the Boys Town Conference Center, a two-story building complete with library, cafeteria, guest rooms, gym, computers and video equipment. The campus of Father Flanagan's Boys' Home is visible across the grasslands a half-mile away. Up to 30 children from 13 to 17 years old with severe to profound hearing loss participate. All have a minimum nonverbal I.Q. of 130 (an I.Q. that does not penalize a person for language difficulty inherent in hearing loss), know sign language and come from either schools for the deaf or public schools. The Boys Town National Institute for Communication Disorder for Children, Sertoma International and the Nebraska Commission for the Hearing Impaired underwrite the estimated $1,250 it costs per student.The Boys Town Institute asks schools for the deaf to nominate students are eligible for the program. Potential participants are also found through testing at the Institute, which annually serves about 3,000 hearing-impaired youngsters from the United States and abroad, along with 3,000 other children with speech and language problems, learning disabilities and cranial facial disorders, such as cleft palate.Dr. Sullivan noted that employment statistics suggest that most deaf people are underemployed in relation to their nonverbal intelligence, with the majority of them doing manual labor. ''We want these gifted deaf children to return to their classrooms more aware of their ability to learn and the variety of things there are to learn,'' she said.''It's opened new doors to them,'' Ramona Crookham, director of the Child Study Center at the Iowa School for the Deaf in Council Bluffs, said of the eight children from the school who have attended the program.''Their grades have improved markedly and they've become school leaders,'' she said. ''We're especially pleased with the teaching suggestions for our faculty, and it's important that these gifted deaf children have a chance to come together with their intellectual peers.''The idea for the program dates to 1980 when Dr. Sullivan did extensive testing of 170 students at the Nebraska School for the Deaf. She found 15 of the children had nonverbal I.Q.'s in the superior range of intellectual abilities, yet more than half of them were poor students.The curriculum developed for the gifted deaf students emphasizes problem-solving. It encompasses fine arts, physical, social, computer and academic activities, such as note-taking, data organization, and reading, writing and interviewing skills. Students also take field trips and participate in a five-day outing that includes camping, canoeing and rock-climbing.The staff includes experts in education from schools for the deaf, Gallaudet College and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, along with special guests -both deaf and with normal hearing - such as a musician, a physicist and a geologist.Bernard Bragg, founder of the National Theater of the Deaf, joins the students in their last week to help them write and put together a documentary videotape similar in format to CBS's ''60 Minutes.''Last summer's program, the focus for the cognitive program was the importance and management of water in Nebraska. The first week the students defined terms, such as pivot irrigation, reservoir and hydroelectric power. The second week, which included the field trip, they traveled throughout Nebraska gathering facts on the state's water situation. They also observed irrigation systems and visited a hydroelectric project and water-purification plant.The third week they had to take what they had observed, analyze and evaluate it, and communicate the information and conclusions in writing. In the final week, they had to translate their writing back into sign language for the videotapes they made with Mr. Bragg.FOR 13-year-old Jason Curry, the only deaf student in the Sedalia (Mo.) Middle School, the experience was exhilarating. ''He came back with a new pride in himself,'' said his mother, Emma Curry. And his speech and language teacher, Kimberly Schroeder, said, ''The change in Jason is absolutely unbelievable. He does well academically but it's how he now feels about himself inside that's different. He just shines with self-esteem, and that's unusual for any young teen-ager, let alone a deaf youngster.''The most noteworthy change in Jeffrey Roberts of Malcolm, Neb., after he attended the program came in his grades. ''What astonished us was the spectacular improvement in his grades,'' said his mother, Romona Roberts. ''As a sophomore, Jeff was only an average student at the Nebraska School for the Deaf. In his junior year, he made the honor roll every quarter.''Next summer's program, which starts July 3, will be open to gifted deaf children nationwide. ''We limited the program to Midwest children the first two years,'' Dr. Sullivan said, ''because we wanted to evaluate it thoroughly before offering it to eligible severly hearing impaired teen-agers across the country.''As for Karen Maliszewski, she hopes that she will be asked to participate again. ''If we go canoeing again, I'm going to be the first down the rapids, and I promise I'll work real hard on the computers,'' she said to her parents in sign language the other day."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/02/nyregion/helping-the-deaf-to-manage-money.html", "headline": "HELPING THE DEAF TO MANAGE MONEY", "date": "1983-01-02T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 2, 1983, Section 11, Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Even though each had married and moved apart, they were now getting together at least once a month.Their attempts to grow even closer were halted when Margaret died two Christmases ago. For Mr. Kennedy, the loss was particularly hard because his sister was deaf and he felt as though he had lost his last chance to get to know her better.''I realized we weren't as close as if she had been able to hear,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''But I also realized after her death, I hadn't tried hard enough to enter her world.''To that end, Mr. Kennedy enrolled in a sign-language course at a local college. Although he and his sister had developed their own simple sign language, much of it was unusable in the deaf community.Nine years before, he had opened a financial investment counseling business in Groton. One of the positions he had held before that was vice president of the Value Line Investment Survey in New York City. With his background in finance, he decided to offer his services as a counselor to the deaf.Unraveling the mysteries of money market certificates, mutual funds and the stock market is confusing enough for people who can talk to one another. For the deaf, the problems are multiplied. There are few people available to them who can explain how the programs work and even fewer who can help them figure out the best investment plans.Mr. Kennedy soon found himself with several deaf clients from as far away as Los Angeles who were having limited success in their attempts to communicate.One client had repeatedly tried to put money in a savings account. The money, however, always ended up in his checking account. Finally, Mr. Kennedy accompanied his client to the bank and the matter was resolved.Another client inherited $200,000. He went into a bank and wrote them a note saying he'd like the money put in a safe place. The teller put it in a safe-deposit box. For 13 years he withdrew $10,000 a year for living expenses. None of it ever earned a penny's worth of interest because the man's initial visit to the bank had been misunderstood by the teller.Sometimes even a translator or interpreter who is well-versed in money matters cannot bring the deaf and hearing worlds together. A deaf client told Mr. Kennedy recently that he couldn't set up an Individual Retirement Account (I.R.A.). When he asked the client where he had heard that, he said his lawyer had told him. When Mr. Kennedy called the lawyer, he said he had in fact told the person he could have an I.R.A. The interpreter had signed the word ''couldn't'' instead of ''could.''To further help his deaf clients, Mr. Kennedy had a telephone device for the deaf installed in his office. This allows them to send messages to him when they are in need of assistance.Mr. Kennedy has been encouraged in his work with the deaf by Nikki Kilpatrick, the company interpreter for the National Theater of the Deaf in Waterford and the teacher of the sign-language course he had been enrolled in.She calls Mr. Kennedy a very active student who wanted to know every word in the language. ''He kept me on my toes,'' Mrs. Kilpatrick said. For the last class, the students met at a local restaurant. They were not allowed to speak until the meal was completed and coffee was being served.Mr. Kennedy recalled the sense of helplessness the students felt. ''We'd get all our signs mixed up. Someone would ask for salt when they meant sugar. It was very hard.'' His work with the deaf since that night has been anything but difficult, however. ''I'm getting a tremendous feeling going into this new world. I get so much more out of it, I think, even than they do,'' Mr. Kennedy said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/17/nyregion/deaf-students-join-the-hearing-world.html", "headline": "DEAF STUDENTS JOIN THE HEARING WORLD", "date": "1982-10-17T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 17, 1982, Section 11, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

All eight, according to Sister Maura Costello, coordinator of the program for 25 deaf students who are ''mainstreamed'' into classes at the 575-student parochial school here, are interested in going to college or obtaining further career training.Although Cleary is a private school, the secondary program, which started three years ago, is state-financed. Thirteen on the Cleary school staff -Sister Costello, three teachers of the deaf, a speech teacher, a counselor and seven interpreter-tutors - join about 20 teachers at Mercy High School to provide a comprehensive program of academic and supportive services to the deaf students here, who are bused from all over Suffolk County.''Some of these students have previously gone to schools for the deaf,'' Sister Costello said, ''but here they have the experience of the hearing world, and yet they have each other for support. Everyone gets mainstreamed for at least one subject, even if it is only physical education.The Cleary program is not typical of education programs for the deaf on Long Island. In fact, there is no ''typical'' program to accommodate an increased deaf population, one of the byproducts of a rubella epidemic in the early 1960's.The methods of instruction and services for the deaf student vary widely among the Island's 129 school districts, but, increasingly, the trend in education of the deaf is put the students in the same classrooms whenever possible so that they will better be able to accommodate to a hearing world.Before the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, commonly known as Public Law 94-142, was enacted in November of 1975, options for the hearing-impaired student were limited. Usually, the deaf were sent to special vocational programs or placed in schools for the deaf. However, the landmark Federal act stipulated that education of the handicapped should be provided in the least restrictive environment possible.According to Norman Doctor, downstate supervisor of regional programs for the education of handicapped children for the New York State Education Department, the state's Board of Regents provided even more flexibility for educating handicapped students when it passed a regulation in March stating that not all handicapped children in special-education classes must necessarily be grouped according to their type of handicap. Academic, social, emotional, physical and management needs have become more important in placing a hearing-impaired child than his particular handicap.''One 15-year-old deaf child may be at second-grade level in reading and another, the same age and with the same handicap, may be at ninth-grade level,'' Dr. Doctor said. ''With the new crosscategorial grouping, a child's abilities are more important than his handicap in placing him.''According to the most recent statistics of the State Education Department, 23 out of 183 deaf children were placed in regular district or Board of Cooperative Educational Services classes in Nassau County last year, and 138 of 208 hearing-impaired children were mainstreamed in the county. In Suffolk, 81 of 253 deaf students were mainstreamed as of December 1981, and of 185 hearing-impaired students, 149 were mainstreamed into normal classroom settings.Both state and Federal regulations require that the education of a deaf child begin at age 3. Some schools for the deaf, such as the Cleary School in Ronkonkoma and the Nassau County Board of Cooperative Educational Services, provide services and training for preschool deaf children and their parents.For the school-age deaf child, many educational options are available, and, according to special education administrators, the school boards and the Committee for the Handicapped -consisting of a teacher or an administrator in special education, a school psychologist and physician, and a parent of a handicapped child residing in the school district - decide on the course of education for each hearing-impaired student individually.Some school districts may choose to mainstream the students, using an itinerant teacher of the deaf hired from Boces, or the district may hire its own teacher. Other districts may provide interpreter services in the classroom, and some may hire note takers for the deaf students or both. Some students may be partly mainstreamed with resource-room support, spending less than half of their school time in special education classes. Others may stay in a self-contained, special education class within the district, or in a specialeducation class run by Boces. Still other deaf children may be placed in one of the two schools for the deaf on the Island - the Mill Neck School in Nassau County, or the Cleary School in Suffolk - or still other private or state schools.Sister Costello believes that mainstreaming deaf students has been beneficial for many students. ''With mainstreaming, they're getting in touch with the real world,'' she said. ''Our program can act as a bridge to that world.''Debbie Dee of East Setauket, a senior in the Cleary secondary program, said she had benefitted academically from mainstreaming. ''In a school for the deaf, you get few choices of subjects,'' she said, ''but here, I'm getting more learning experiences that are important for college.''Her classmate, Bobbie Wirthenson of Lake Ronkonkoma, also a senior, agreed with her. ''For me, there's not enough to learn in a school for the deaf,'' he said. ''But here, I'm studying more, and thinking more.''For the last five years, Boces 3, which supervises 18 western districts in Suffolk County, has been running a program for 14 hearing-impaired students at Northport High School, similar to Cleary's secondary program at Mercy High School. All the hearingimpaired children are mainstreamed into some classes with hearing children, and all also attend special education classes. Interpreter services, speech therapy, and supportive tutoring are provided for the hearing-impaired students.Dr. Nora Lynch, a teacher of the deaf at Northport High School, said the ''invisible handicap'' of deafness was becoming more visible lately as hearing-impaired students were mainstreamed into normal classes with interpreters.The Shorham Wading River school district was among the first on the Island to hire an interpreter-teacher for deaf students on a oneto-one basis. The deaf student graduated last year, after four years of attending regular classes.''We weren't required by law to mainstream the student, but we felt we could best serve the child in this way,'' said Dr. Richard Doremus, superintendent of Shorham-Wading River schools. ''As a result, a number of our teachers and students took courses in signing.''Among other districts that have mainstreamed deaf children are Smithtown, Kings Park, Riverhead and Sachem in Suffolk County, and Oyster Bay-East Norwich, Hewlett-Woodmere, Lawrence, Hicksville and Rockville Centre school districts in Nassau County.Bill Clark, principal of the Nassau County Boces program for the hearing impaired, said the emphasis in teaching deaf children here was on allowing them to develop the skill of lip reading, since ''in the real world, few people know sign language.'' However, in school districts like Smithtown, interpreters are provided for hearing impaired children because, according to Audrey Yacos, a speech pathologist and teacher of the deaf in the district, many students can only pick up about one-third of what is said through lip reading. Sister Doris Marie Batt, superintendent of the Cleary School, said: ''Before 1974, we were totally an oral school. But then, we saw the need for total communication since even when lip reading is developed maximally, only 60 percent of what is said can be picked up.''The Cleary School currently has 63 students enrolled from age 3 to age 14. Sister Batt said each student's progress and placement was re-evaluated at the end of each school year, adding: ''If parents want their child mainstreamed, we have an open mind.''One hundred seventy-five students from Nassau, western Suffolk and Queens, age 3 to 21 years old, attend the Mill Neck Manor school for the deaf in Nassau County. ''Some children here are mainstreamed for some classes in their school districts, but of all handicapping conditions, mainstreaming for the deaf is among the most difficult,'' said Henry Bjorlie, the school's superintendent.Dr. Ann Mulholland, an internationally recognized expert on the education of the deaf who formerly headed the program for the hearing impaired at Teachers College, Columbia University, said mainstreaming deaf children worked best when the children had been prepared for it with auditory experience and training from as early an age as possible.There are two colleges for the deaf in the country: the National Institute for the Deaf in Rochester, N.Y., and Gallaudet College in Washington. On the Island, the two community colleges have expanded the services provided for hearing impaired students since the passage of Public Law 94-142. Nassau Community College initiated a program for hearing impaired students some four years ago with funds from a Federal grant. According to Janis Schimsky, coordinator of the program, which currently services six deaf students and 25 hearing impaired students on campus, individual tutoring, remedial courses, nine part-time interpreters and note takers are available for the hearing impaired and deaf students. The college also offers a course in sign language.''Before the 1970's, very few deaf students went to hearing colleges,'' Mrs. Schimsky said. Suffolk Community College has eight deaf or hearing impaired students enrolled for courses this term for whom interpreters and volunteer note takers are provided. With a $100,000 gift from the estate of Henry A.

''This is a varied state,'' he said, ''and it's hard to imagine that we'd have to go elsewhere. But we're not limiting the search.''He described the ideal new home as ''a modest, restful place, perhaps a small farm with a barn that could be used for rehearsals, some office space and a few bedrooms for visitors.'' All of which comes very close to describing the O'Neill Theater Center.A move has been under consideration ever since the Theater of the Deaf severed its official connection with the O'Neill in January, becoming an independent nonprofit corporation. The catalyst was a recent letter informing the Theater of the Deaf that its office space is needed for the expansion of the O'Neill's National Theater Institute.The Theater of the Deaf now shares the O'Neill farmhouse with the N.T.I., a resident program for theater students. ''N.T.I. has taken off,'' said George C. White, president and founder of the O'Neill. ''Enrollment is up, and we have more kids than we know what to do with. We need that space.''Mr. White said the Theater of the Deaf could continue to rehearse at the O'Neill after April, but he understood that Mr. Hays and his company might prefer to keep everything under one roof. ''We told him there would be no penalties if they move out earlier so they can get a better deal.''Mr. Hays was optimistic that a new home would not be hard to find. ''We are the kind of group that is regarded as an enhancement to the life of a community,'' he said, adding that ''we can't carry a large burden of purchase or maintenance.''''Groups like ours,'' he said, ''have often gotten gifts of small properties'' or other community support. ''We're looking for a friend such as the O'Neill has been.''Prior to the January separation, the National Theater of the Deaf and the National Playwrights Conference were the O'Neill's oldest and most famous offspring.Many O'Neill employees and patrons were openly distressed by the break, which Mr. Hays says was prompted by the desire to save some $100,000 in administration and overhead. The Theater of the Deaf has an annual operating budget of about $900,000, funded by Federal grants, donations and box office receipts.Mr. Hays was a successful Broadway scenic designer when he founded the Theater of the Deaf at the O'Neill in 1963. It now has programs for deaf playwrights, students and theater personnel as well as an international touring company, which received a special Tony Award in 1977.The director specified that any new home will have to provide economy. ''Our independence is hard won,'' he said, ''and we wish to preserve it.''The Theater of the Deaf's newest production, ''Parzival, From the Horse's Mouth,'' is based on the stories of King Arthur. It will premiere Friday and Saturday at Connecticut College in New London before going on national tour."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/08/nyregion/political-action-urged-for-deaf.html", "headline": "POLITICAL ACTION URGED FOR DEAF", "date": "1982-08-08T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 8, 1982, Section 11, Page 7Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

''Because we're now facing potential cuts to human services budgets, the handicapped must become politically vigilant. The times require it for all groups who have spent the past decade trying to enter the mainstream of human life.''More than 90 persons from chapters of the registry throughout the country gathered in the State House of Representatives here for a workshop designed to teach lobbying skills to deaf and hearingimpaired people and their interpreters.Christine Stranges of Hartford, the convention chairman, said that not only deaf people and interpreters, but also parents, educators, counselors and vocational rehabilitation workers were becoming increasingly aware that the political arena was the appropriate place to protect the rights of the handicapped.The 20-year-old national organization for interpreters meets every two years, lists 64 chapters in the United States and has a membership of 5,000. More than 600 people attended the six-day convention, from July 27-Aug. 1, during which workshops were held on developing skills for political advocacy, for unionization, for mental-health interpreting and for legal proceedings.Those attending the political process workshop at the Capitol not only listened to descriptions of the mechanics of state legislatures, but also participated in mock subcommittee hearings and maneuvered a bill through several legislative hurdles to final passage.''One can't find a better place to teach these skills than an active legislative chamber,'' said Dr. Edward E. Corbett Jr., vice president of the registry and director of the National Academy of Gallaudet College in Washington, D.C. ''Connecticut has one of the most advanced programs in the country for the hearing impaired. The experience of people working in the field here can serve as a model for R.I.D. members working in other states.''''Most people, and especially the handicapped, are intimidated by the political process,'' said Mrs. Hudson. ''In high school, civics and government are often perceived as fairly boring subjects. This workshop was designed to take the political process out of the textbook and bring it alive.''Sharing her political experience with workshop participants was Barbara B. Brasel, executive director of the Commission for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired, an agency set up by a legislative act in 1972. Mrs. Brasel, who was appointed by the Governor, said that the major factor contributing to the growth of services for the deaf population in Connecticut had been ''the development of a good working relationship between my agency and key legislators.''''R.I.D. members want to understand why and how we have been successful here,'' explained Mrs. Brasel through an interpreter. ''I tell them I make it my business to know when legislation affecting us is coming up before committee. It's a key part of my position. I have formed a strong information network and appear at the Capitol building regularly to testify on pertinent bills.''The commission, in addition to providing statewide interpreting services in public and private elementary and secondary schools and colleges, employs trained people for job development and placement, legal counseling and settlement of employment grievances.The agency's current budget, approved by the General Assemby last spring, is $620,000, up from $75,000 during the first year of its operation in 1972, reported Mrs. Brasel. In addition the commission receives $137,000 annually in Federal block grants. According to a 1970 census, there are 170,000 hearing-impaired and 25,000 profoundly deaf residents in the state. The cost for an interpreter in the classroom runs $7,000 to $10,000 a semester. The agency employs 48 interpreters.A recent Supreme Court decision defining the need for interpreters of the deaf in public school classrooms has caused concern among registry members that these services will be reduced in the future. The Amy Rowley decision, handed down on June 28 and involving a student in New York State, says it must be shown that a pupil cannot derive benefit from his education without supplemental assistance before interpreting services are provided. The schools, according to the decision, are not obligated to provide special assistance to students who can master their studies without interpreters.According to Mrs. Brasel, ''the notion that a deaf child must reach a level of failure before he or she has the right to special services is absurd. I already have one school district in the state trying to back out of its commitment to provide an interpreter for a deaf student.''Maureen Chaput, a registry member, explained that the Connecticut chapter of the organization had focused traditionally on defining and upgrading interpreters' skills. However, the need to shift emphasis toward protecting the legal rights of deaf clients has been keenly felt within the organization in recent months, she said.A major area of concern is the proposed regulatory changes in the National Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which, according to Mrs. Chaput, would result in staff and program cuts for the handicapped.''Legislative and political concerns are beginning to upstage our earlier issues,'' she said. ''Because this is an election year, we don't expect the full impact of the budget cuts to be felt on our agency until the following year,'' said Mrs. Brasel. ''We nevertheless feel very wary in the long run and for good reason.''Here in Connecticut my deafness is an inconvenience,'' she said. ''When I leave the state, it becomes a handicap. We don't want to lose the gains we have fought so hard for.''Nancy Katz, coordinator of Career Education for the Deaf at Northwestern Connecticut Community College in Winsted, said she would return from the workshop in Hartford with a basic question for her 22 students.''I am going to ask them, 'How many of you are registered voters?' That definitely is the first place to start,'' she said. ''The workshop has made it very clear to me that there needs to be more than sporadic attention to political matters among our student body. They need to understand that they can have a direct effect on the quality of their lives by assuming political responsibility.''From State Representative Thomas D. Ritter, Democrat of Hartford and a member of the Joint Appropriations Committee, came this recollection: ''I remember during budget hearings this spring a Senator came in and said, 'No, you can't cut that item.' The Senator said she received five phone calls from constituents about the matter the previous evening. Because of that, the proposal wasn't cut after all. It's astonishing, but that kind of direct lobbying really makes a tremendous difference. You can't afford to overlook this fact.''Besides the practical problems of going through life with a hearing impairment, there is a direct correlation between one's handicap and one's ability to make money,'' he continued. ''That's the bottom line. The need for political know-how among special interest groups is becoming imperative.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/04/nyregion/mother-of-deaf-pupil-criticizes-decision.html", "headline": "MOTHER OF DEAF PUPIL CRITICIZES DECISION", "date": "1982-07-04T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 4, 1982, Section 11, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

''This is a setback - way back - for deaf people and perhaps all the handicapped. Are they going to take away Braille books for the blind and ramps for people in wheelchairs?''Mrs. Rowley and her husband, Clifford, are also deaf. She learned of the decision on Monday after a reporter used a special telephone communications system for the deaf, known as a TTY, to reach Mr. Rowley, a research chemist in Fair Lawn, N.J. He in turn typed out the message to Mrs. Rowley, through the TTY in the study of their split level home here.When the telephone or doorbell rings in the home, lights turn on. Mrs. Rowley, who can speak and read lips, said she received two calls before the one from her husband but her 12-year-old son, John, who can hear, was away at camp and she cannot communicate without the TTY. Amy was also in camp - a regular day camp, not a camp for the handicapped - when the ruling was announced.Amy has just completed the fourth grade at Furnace Woods Elementary School, and her mother displayed a report card showing that she had worked at fifth-grade level in vocabulary and science, at sixth grade level in reading comprehension and language, and at eighth-grade level in spelling and mathematics.Mrs. Rowley expressed concern about Amy's progress in school in the fall, when she will have to manage for the first time in two years without an interpreter. ''As long as she had the interpreter, she did fantasically,'' Mrs. Rowley said. ''Without it, everything is hard. She will get only half as much from her classes, and it will get harder as time goes on.'' She said the couple could not afford to pay $10,000 to $15,000 to hire an interpreter themselves, and they would not send her to a school for the deaf.''I am a teacher of the deaf, and I taught her before she started kindergarten,'' Mrs. Rowley said. ''She was equal to all the other children when she began. They did not give her an interpreter, at first, because they said she was doing fine. Does she have to fail before they will give her one?''Mrs. Rowley said Amy was far ahead of students her age who attended schools for the deaf, and she added that those students read, on the average, at a third-grade level when they graduated from high school.Furnace Woods Elementary School may provide Amy with a tutor for one hour a day, working on a one-to-one basis outside the classrom. ''But she will get only half of what happens in the class,'' her mother said.Asked if she felt the school should spend thousands of dollars a year on the private interpreter, Mrs. Rowley said: ''They spent thousands on a lawyer fighting against Amy's needs.'' She noted that the district was among the wealthiest in the state because of the taxes generated by the Indian Point power plant. It spends $6,000 per year per student, she said, compared to the state average of $3,400.Mrs. Rowley said she had expected a decision, but was not prepared for the one that came. ''This is it,'' she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/nyregion/for-a-deaf-child-a-friendly-town.html", "headline": "FOR A DEAF CHILD, A 'FRIENDLY TOWN'", "date": "1982-05-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 16, 1982, Section 1, Page 54Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

But that is not all there is to his world. From the time he was 7 years old, Desmond, who is deaf, has also seen the green hills and clear streams of the country in summer, where he goes to visit a family in the Lower Hudson Valley.Desmond, now 12, goes to the country through the Fresh Air Fund, an independent, nonprofit group that sends underprivileged children from New York City to camps or to stay with families in the country for two to four weeks.While the fund, now preparing for its 106th summer, has always sent handicapped children to camps, its first handicapped child to stay with a host family in one of the fund's ''friendly towns'' was Desmond. Others have followed.''A planned effort was made to bring together those youngsters desiring a 'friendly town' experience and also requiring special attention, with host families who had the interest and the ability to meet their needs,'' said Pam Galehouse, who coordinates placing handicapped children for the fund. Most of the families who take handicapped children live in or near Middletown, N.Y., where Desmond has been going for his summer visits. Teacher Initiated ProgramThe campaign to bring handicapped children to stay with families in the Middletown area was initiated by Susanna Prey, chairman of the Middletown Fresh Air Fund Committee and assistant area representative for the Lower Hudson Valley. When Mrs. Prey, a teacher at the Middletown Day Nursery, decided to participate in the Fresh Air Fund, she said she wanted to have a child who might not be able to participate because of a handicap. And she decided to ask for a child who was deaf, because she was familiar with that handicap from her teaching experience.So in 1976 Desmond arrived at Mrs. Prey's big, airy house at the foot of the Shawangunk Mountain Range to stay with her and her three children, two dogs and pony. He has returned every summer, and sometimes at Christmas, to stay with the Prey family, who are the same to him as his brothers, sisters and friends.There, among apple, spruce and maple trees, vegetable gardens and streams with fish, Desmond experienced the contrast of the country for the first time. ''In the evening, he would go and walk through the grass, looking at the trees and flowers, or just sit on the back porch and look out,'' Mrs. Prey said. Her own children, who have also had experience with the deaf, encouraged him to communicate by talking rather than gesturing, to improve his speech.''All of us in the program believe in the importance of getting these children out of the city.'' said Mrs. Prey, who has visited some of the families in their urban homes. ''We realize how important it is for them to see another way of life, to know that there is something more than treeless streets and burnt-out buildings.'' 'It's a Great Outlet'After Desmond's first summer, his mother, Lea Foster, who works as a telephone operator in Manhattan, signed up all five of her other children for the program. Like Desmond, they have gone to stay with host families near Middletown, one of 350 ''friendly towns'' in 13 states along the East Coast where the fund operates.''It's a great outlet for the children,'' Mrs. Foster said, ''with a lot of freedom, open space, where they are exposed to different things. These families in Middletown are warm and beautiful and really care about the children.''And all winter long, Mrs. Foster said, her children look forward to the summer months. Mrs. Foster said the experience has helped her children to grow and gain confidence, ''to see how other people live and see how they want to lead their lives.''A fund spokesman, Jean Halajian, said that it costs $80, mostly for transportation, to send a child to a host family. Two weeks at a fund summer camp costs $392.Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 70 West 40th Street, New York, N.Y. 10018. Those wishing to be hosts should call the Fresh Air Fund at (212) 221-0900."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/nyregion/hard-of-hearing-group-receives-service-award.html", "headline": "Hard of Hearing Group Receives Service Award", "date": "1982-05-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 9, 1982, Section 1, Page 32Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

This would mean, he said, that there would be hardly enough left to pay for salaries in a situation where the ratio of staff to clients, one-to-one plus support aides, is necessarily so high.In an interview with Mr. Adler and Robert Smithdas, the center's deaf-blind director of community education, the director saw a glimmer of hope in a bill before Congress that would exempt the center from the across-the-board cuts in discretionary funds that most services to the handicapped are expected to suffer.The measure is sponsored by by Representative John LeBoutillier of Westbury, the freshman Republican whose Sixth Congressional District on the North Shore includes Sands Point, and Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a Middletown, N.Y., Republican.''Both Congressmen are saying that the center should not be left out of the safety net President Reagan promised,'' said Mr. Adler. He and others involved in the center have been seeking support from Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, whose seat on the Appropriations Committee puts him in a position to help a companion bill along in the Senate. So far, Mr. Adler said, the Senator has made no commitment.Representative LeBoutillier, according to his legislative assistant, Jon Weinstein, feels there is ''an excellent possibility'' that his bill creating a separate budget line for the center will be passed in the House. In regard to actual appropriations, that is a different matter., Mr. Weinstein said that last year, ''at a crucial period,'' Mr. LeBoutillier succeeded in having a threatened recission of funding ''cancelled out'' after a ''heart-to-heart talk'' with David Stockman, the Budget Director.According to Mr. Weinstein, the Representative sent Mr. Stockman a letter on Monday officially declaring his opposition to any cuts in funding for the center in the Federal budget for fiscal 1983.In the Senate, a companion bill providing for a separate budget line has been prepared by Senator Jennings Randolph, who sponsored landmark legislation in the 1930's that provided services to the handicapped. According to a Randolph staff assistant, Helen Eagle, the Senator expects to introduce his bill ''hopefully, within the next few weeks.''On Wednesday, Senator D'Amato's press secretary, Gary Lewi, said Mr. D'Amato was ''co-sponsoring Senator Randolph's bill, so I guess that answers the question of whether or not we support it.''The Helen Keller Center was created in 1969 by Act of Congress following a sharp increase in the birthrate of deaf-blind infants resulting from a nationwide rubella epidemic in the mid-60's.From 1963 to 1965, about 10,000 deaf-blind children were born to women who had caught German measles while they were pregnant. About 6,000 of these children have survived, and experts estimate that up to 3,000 may be capable of rehabilitation.The rate of deaf-blind births now, since the inception of almost universal vaccination against rubella, is only about 300 a year, although others become deaf-blind through illness and injury.At present, the Helen Keller center, on a campus-like setting, serves 46 live-in deaf-blind clients over the age of 18, who have come from 30 states for education, rehabilitation and vocational training. Their origin and degree of previous education are varied.''We find them on mountaintops,'' said Mr. Adler, ''living alone; in state retardation facilities, improperly diagnosed; in back rooms of their families' homes and in unmentionable places.''Mr. Smithdas, who was ''listening'' to Mr. Adler's exposition of the center's problem with the help of Steve McCallan, who was fingerspelling the conversation into his palm, said: ''I do feel that Congress has an obligation to support a program it voted unanimously for.''At the center, where communication with others is the first skill its clients must learn, there are numerous advanced diagnostic and teaching devices. They include a vibrating floor for transmitting ''the feel'' of speech; a machine that transmits Braille over telephone lines and a keyboard instrument that makes clusters of pins pop up in the shape of Braille letters for the ''listener'' to feel.There are gadgets that can help foster independence, like a pocketsize vibrator that receives messages from a transmitter so that deafblind people can ''call'' each other from a distance, and a fan activated by a doorbell, so that a deaf-blind person feels the breeze when a visitor is at the door. Many of these devices and gadgets were invented and developed by engineers in the center's research department.To be accepted at the center, deaf-blind applicants must meet certain criteria. Eligibility hinges upon their degree of disability, their own motivation, and the willingness of their states to sponsor them, at a fee of $180 a week. That amount represents about 13 percent of the cost of the highly individualized instructional program. The Federal Government pays for the rest of the cost.Acceptance of applicants also depends upon space availability. Some clients remain a few months, others may stay a few years, but generally, Mr. Adler said, they remain about 11 months. The current waiting list has about a dozen names.The center also serves as the hub of a nationwide network of regional representatives who provide a wide range of services at no cost to deaf-blind persons and their families, and to public and private agencies. They try to locate, assist and refer deaf-blind individuals to the most appropriate programs.Nowhere else in the country, however, does there exist the professional expertise and the sophisticated equipment available here in the Sands Point buildings. Opened in 1976 on its present site - where a World War II naval training station once stood - the center's primary objective is to train its residents to become as selfsufficient as possible. Some achieve a degree of independence difficult to conceive of, considering their almost overwhelming isolation.Previously, the center's program operated out of temporary rental headquarters in New Hyde Park for a smaller number of clients, most of whom resided at nearby facilities owned by the Industrial Home for the Blind.Mr. Smithdas, who lost his sight and hearing after suffering meningitis at the age of 4, adjusted to his handicap at a time when an institution such as the Helen Keller National Center was almost inconceivable.Now 55, he is the first deaf-blind person since Helen Keller to be graduated from college. He holds a master's degree in vocational guidance and rehabilitation of the handicapped, as well as three honorary doctorates. Long active as a staff member of the Industrial Home for the Blind, which is the center's parent organization, he was deeply involved in writing the Federal legislation that established the Helen Keller Center.Mr. Smithdas, who is a travelling lecturer, author and poet, lives with his wife, Michelle, in Port Washington. Mrs. Smithdas, who is also deaf-blind, is an assistant instructor at the center.In addition to the Administration's proposed across-the-board cutback to services to the handicapped, the Helen Keller National Center faces another budgetary blow. The $16 million annual Federal appropriation that has been going to the states specifically for elementary and secondary education of the deaf-blind is scheduled to be discontinued as a result of the Administration's New Federalism plan.Mr. Adler, the center's director, suggested that instead of reallocating that $16 million as block grants to the states, as now planned, the Federal Government should assign a major portion to the Helen Keller National Center. Until now, nationwide standards for services to the deaf-blind have been supervised by Federal agencies. It is a job the states are not equipped to do, Mr. Adler said.Instead, he contended, the center should be assigned ''to act as an umbrella agency to oversee and manage the continued training of these rubella kids who are over 18, so they are not lost.'' That, he said, ''is our crucial concern.''We're now facing having to depend on the private sector to make up the Federal deficit,'' he said. ''It is our expectation that the private sector will never be able to provide, on a consistent basis, funding equal to the Federal allocation.''''Congress must realize that this is not a giveaway program or a handout,'' said Mr. Smithdas. ''It can make these people independent, get them on their feet, allow them, through the kind of intensive and comprehensive training that the states can't give to express their talents and abilities and contribute to their own livelihood.''By cutting back, Congress would be rescinding its establishment of the Helen Keller National Center and throwing services to the deaf-blind back into the Dark Ages.''Mr. Adler regarded his colleague quietly for a moment. Then he asked, ''If these cuts go through, how many Bob Smithdases will be lost to society, and instead, at the taxpayers' expense, spend their lives in institutions?''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/28/archives/court-ruling-seen-as-benefit-for-deaf.html", "headline": "COURT RULING SEEN AS BENEFIT FOR DEAF", "date": "1982-02-28T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 28, 1982, Section 11, Page 19Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Chatoff is representing Amy Rowley and her parents, Clifford and Nancy Rowley, in a suit to force statewide school provision of individual sign language interpreters for certain deaf children during classroom time. Amy is in the fourth grade in the Hendrick Hudson School District in Cortlandt and has had the help of an interpreter, Fran Miller, who is paid by the district.Miss Acevedo, coordinator of the interpreter-training program at the college, explained that Mr. Chatoff could not use a signer because it is not a language he understands. Most adults who lose their hearing in their mature years, as he did, she said, have not acquired the signing skills that Amy learned as a child.Miss Acevedo, who is not deaf, is an advocate of the right of the deaf to be ''heard'' by the nondeaf world. ''They ought to be respected for their own culture,'' she said, ''and for their accomplishment in communication whether solely in American Sign Language, which is a visual language in its own right and has its own grammar, or for their use of A.S.L. in combination with signing, or manual English, which follows the grammar and word sequence of spoken English.''The background of the suit includes the philosophy of total communication in which mouthing words, lip-reading, amplification, American Sign Language, signed English, touching, body language and visual clues all are used in combination for maximum understanding, she said.''The general attitude of society is that success is measured by the degree of oral participation - to speak and to speech-read,'' Miss Acevedo noted. She stressed, however, that this is an intolerant position ''because there are signers who lip-read badly, but still can read and write quite well, and they really may be even more successful with their own two languages and their mix of the two cultures.''''I wish people could understand the greater skills of the verbal deaf when they are native speakers of A.S.L. and learn our English as their second language,'' Miss Acevedo said. ''A.S.L. is a concept system they learn from their deaf and nonverbal parents, and it is not less of a language in its ability to communicate meaning just because most people do not comprehend it.''This is the situation for 5 to 7 percent of deaf children, who go to school with an excellent vocabulary in American Sign Language. Other deaf children, she said, may learn it as their second language at a residential school after age 5 or 6. Still other children are ''mainstreamed'' into oral schools with varying degrees of support and success in learning to speak and speech-read, perhaps reaching high school or college before learning American Sign Language as a second language.The two-year training for interpreters at Westchester Community College includes an initiation into American Sign Language and an introduction to the techniques of dealing with different needs of deaf clients in business, public meeting and performance situations. Interpreters can become qualified in spoken English to signing English or in spoken English to American Sign Language.''Interpreters are needed in personal situations, and we wish there could be a better understanding of the worth of that assistance,'' Miss Acevedo said. ''The deaf person's rights are better served at, say, a Social Security office or in a hospital, and in any program underwritten by Federal funding they have a right to an interpreter.''Last Tuesday, her class heard Margaret Ransom, who ''signed'' a performance of ''Ain't Misbehavin'' on Broadway this month with Alan Champion. Miss Ransom discussed conveying the artistry and poetry of such a revue with American Sign Language. In a program subsidized through the Theater Access Project of the Theater Development Fund, there will be similar provisions made at Lincoln Center for an opera on March 30 and for ''Annie'' on March 31. For information, call (212) 719-4537, a telephone that handles both voice and TTY, a Teletype connection with printout capability.September Polk is the staff interpreter for the county and can call upon seven other interpreters when there is a need for a signer. ''We get calls from IBM, Xerox and A.T.&T.; when their programs include deaf employees,'' Miss Polk said, ''and we also serve the courts, for plaintiffs or witnesses, as well as government agencies. In these cases there is a right of access to an interpreter provided by the county,'' she said. There will be a meeting at the Greenburgh Public Library March 20 at 2 P.M. on county services to the deaf.

She never sees the eager faces of the students who sit in her classroom or the smiles of people who attend her lectures.Miss Lawhorn is deaf and blind. But she knows when she hits a sour note on her piano or bombs with one of her audiences. It is an instinct she has developed over the years.''You know things are happening in a room and you're missing them,'' she said. ''There are things going on, music and chatter, and an interpreter can't tell it all. I know I'm missing some things.''But she never dwells on that. Instead, for 40 years she has made a career of teaching, lecturing, writing and reciting monologues, playing the piano and composing poetry about her philosophy of life. Travels Around the CountryHer professional performing days are over, but Miss Lawhorn still travels around the country, lecturing on how to teach the deaf and blind. She also teaches an independent living course for adult deafblind students at the Hadley School for the Blind, in suburban Winnetka.Miss Lawhorn communicates in a variety of ways: through an interpreter, Morse code, vibrations, a sign in the palm or even a simple touch on her hand.She has been using those methods most of her 63 years. Miss Lawhorn lost her sight at 12 and her hearing at 19. Doctors never determined precisely why she lost either, although she had a bad case of measles at age 5.''There was fear and sorrow,'' she recalled of her family's reaction. ''Everyone was busy trying to make me happy.'' But the Lawhorns also set the pace for their daughter's adjustment by learning the manual alphabet, including her in their plans and encouraging h er.''Quite often a teacher would say, 'She can't do this or that,' '' Miss Lawhorn said. ''My mother would say, 'Let her try it.' '' Mother Hid Her FeelingsBut, Miss Lawhorn added: ''My mother never really mentioned what her feelings were. I couldn't see or hear her. She always had t o be cheerful.''And she said that before she lost her hearing, ''I would sometimes hear my mother cry when she was alone.'' Miss Lawhorn remembers reciting once a week so she would remember how to speak clearly. She is now a poised, articulate speaker. ''My only real loss,'' she said, ''was the loss of radio shows. I began to create my own radio programs in my own head.'' But there was fear of isolation. ''At first,'' Miss Lawhorn said, ''I was afraid I was going to get completely cut off and not do the things I planned in life.''She abandoned childhood plans to become a singer but began writing comedy monologues about everyday life. In the 1940's, she performed her monologues in a one-woman show at Carnegie Hall. She last performed professionally at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. Not Sure She Wants Marriage''I wanted to be married and have a family,'' she said in an interview conducted with the aid of Jan Warren, an interpreter who relayed questions in sign language into Miss Lawhorn's palm. ''I had the romances but they never developed into marriage. Now I don't know if I could adjust to marriage.''Miss Lawhorn, who lives alone in a South Side apartment, manages well with the help of modern technology. She cooks her meals in a kitchen with Braille cooking utensils, cookbooks and appliances. Her ''doorbell'' is a string attached to a fan. When a visitor tugs the string, the breeze from the fan alerts her.Despite her adjustments, there are still frustrations. ''I'd like to be able to jump in a car and race around, rather than call 10 or 20 people and ask them to drive me,'' she said. But Miss Lawhorn says she has no time to complain, adding, ''I enjoy what I get and I don't worry about the rest.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/nyregion/counseling-lifts-hopes-of-deaf.html", "headline": "COUNSELING LIFTS HOPES OF DEAF", "date": "1981-07-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 26, 1981, Section 11, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

''He usually can't get right down to discussing his problem - whether it's medical, legal or marital - without stumbling over the language barrier.''With this in mind, Mr. Bellitz and his wife, Adele Wiggins-Bellitz, formed Professionals for the Deaf, a referrral and counseling service in this South Jersey city.In their first six months of operation, the Bellitzes have counseled, among others, a deaf woman whose infant died, guided several deaf people through the red tape of applying for food stamps and assisted in a child-custody case in which one parent was deaf.''We want to offer the deaf community the same benefits that the hearing community gets, and try to bring their standard of living up,'' said Mr. Bellitz, who received his certification as a counselor for the deaf from Gallaudet College in Washington, D.C.He estimated that there were 60,000 residents of the seven counties south of Trenton with hearing difficulties. About 25 percent of them are profoundly deaf.Although they will provide an interpreter if necessary, Mr. and Mrs. Bellitz stress that theirs is not an interpreting service. Rather, they refer clients to lawyers, real-estate agents, insurance brokers, social workers and doctors who are familiar with the needs of the hearing impaired and are willing to take the extra time involved in working with them.In addition to maintaining lists of professionals willing to work with the deaf, the Bellitzes do some personal counseling themselves. ''Deaf people have the same problems as anyone else - marital crisis, career, family problems,'' Mr. Bellitz said. ''Some problems involve parents with deaf children.''Recently, he worked with a deaf man in his 20's who had been arrested for possession of marijuana. Other cases have involved job discrimination and problems with insurance coverage.Much of the Bellitzes' work involves educating the hearing world about the difficulties that deaf people encounter in their day-to-day lives, such as not being able to use a telephone or hear a door bell.''Community awareness can serve as much to prevent mental-health problems among the deaf as any direct counseling,'' said Mrs. Wiggins-Bellitz, who conducts presentations at area schools and before service clubs such as the Kiwanis and Rotary.In the schools, she introduces youngsters to American sign-language and teaches them the manual alphabet, which uses finger shapes to represent letters.''We give each child a chance to finger-spell his own name,'' Mrs. Wiggins-Bellitz said. ''Most of them are intrigued.'' In programs aimed at adults, she and her husband discuss what they regard as one of the most serious problems facing the deaf: underemployment.''Because of the job discrimination they run into, many nonhearing people are forced to take jobs far below their abilities,'' Mr. Bellitz said. ''By talking to business groups, we hope to increase their awareness and create more of a positive acceptance of the deaf.''A former teacher of the handicapped, Mr. Bellitz had little contact with the deaf until he served as a substitute teacher in a class for the hard of hearing. He was so fascinated by how lively and colorful their communications were, he recalled, that he enrolled for two years at Gallaudet College, the nation's only college specifically for the deaf.By contrast, Mrs. Wiggins-Bellitz grew up as the hearing child of deaf parents. She learned sign language as her first language. The two met while she was serving as an interpreter, he as a coordinator of interpreters.The Bellitzes began Professionals for the Deaf last January with money from a personal loan and the promise of grants from private foundations and corporations. They do not charge their clients for counseling or referral.The couple anticipates establishing sign-language classes for parents of deaf children, and to conduct workshops for the deaf on topics such as how to choose a lawyer and how to buy stocks and bonds.In the last few years, Mr. Bellitz noted, the media has focused more attention on the plight of the deaf, and more and more programs are being designed for them.For example, several New Jersey churches have begun offering services in sign language. Producers of television programs are providing interpreters for news and entertainment shows, and a chapter of the New Jersey Poetry Society recently held a reading of members' work at which an interpreter ''recited'' the verses in sign language.Even so, the deaf, Mr. Bellitz contends, still lag behind other handicapped groups in achieving simple rights. ''There's no one to blame, it's just that this is the first time that the problems of the deaf are being brought to most people's attention,'' he said.''A lot of the provisions being made for the handicapped involve orthopedic devices, such as ramps. Once you build a ramp, it's a single expense and it's finished, paid for. But an interpreter is a continuing expense, and many organizations can't afford that.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/nyregion/community-involved-in-education-of-deaf.html", "headline": "COMMUNITY INVOLVED IN EDUCATION OF DEAF", "date": "1981-04-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 12, 1981, Section 11, Page 22Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

After gesturing that he could not hear, the driver was astounded when the officer repeated the charge - in sign language - and presented him with a speeding ticket.That the policeman could communicate this way is not regarded as unusual by residents of this small Connecticut town near the Massachusetts border. The Chief of Police and other officers have studied sign language at the community college, as have several merchants, teachers, waitresses, bank tellers and hospital employees. The community's continuing interest in the education of the deaf has helped support a post-secondary school program being offered at the college. Called Career Education for the Deaf, the seven-year-old program allows hearing-impaired students to be put into regular college classes and provides them with interpreters, tutors and notetakers.The town has provided summer jobs, financed by the Federal Comprehensive Education and Training Act, for some of the students. The Winsted Lions Club has donated audio-visual equipment to the college's Center for Deaf Education and the Quota Club has contributed a tele-typewriter and flashing doorbells for students' apartments.''No matter where the students go, on campus or off, they can usually find someone who can communicate with them,'' said Jack A. LeBlond, a founder of the program and now a consultant for the state Department of Education's vocational rehabilitation division. At Northwestern, he added, ''the deaf student is envisioned as a total student - academically and socially.''The college, which has no dormitories, helps its deaf students find housing, provides interpreters at on-campus cultural events and ceremonies and offers counseling in speech therapy.An extensive audio-visual center adds captioning to televised programs such as Presidential addresses and keeps tapes of interpreted classes for students to review. Special FM transmitters are available for hard-of-hearing students and their instructors for use in the classroom.Northwestern was the first Connecticut college to implement a program for the deaf, and it still offers the most extensive support services, said Nancy G. Katz, the program coordinator.Most of the 26 hearing-impaired students enrolled this semester are Connecticut residents. The remainder are from New England or New York, with one from Iran. Connecticut residents pay tuition and fees of $177 a semester, though the 1981-82 cost has just been increased to $202. Tuition and fees for out-of-state residents will be $622 a semester next fall.Interpreting and other support services are free to Connecticut residents but cost $1,000 a semester for outside students. Of the more than two dozen deaf students who have received associate degrees from Northwestern, most have transferred to fouryear state colleges to acquire bachelor's degrees in education, science or the liberal arts.Northwestern offers hearing students an associates degree in General Arts and Sciences with an option in interpreting for the deaf and, for advanced students, a certificate program in basic interpreting skills. Six of the 10 interpreters on Mrs. Katz's staff were trained at Northwestern.Though many educators disagree over which method of communication for the deaf - oral (speech and speech reading) or manual (signs and finger spelling) - is ''best,'' Northwestern does not advocate one over the other. ''Deaf persons should be exposed to all modes of communication and choose the one that is best for them.''However, most of the deaf students at the college depend on sign language ''because they are more comfortable with it,'' she said. ''Not everyone is lip readable,'' Mrs. Katz explained, citing as examples men with beards or mustaches or persons who do not pronounce words clearly. A few of the students speak and all are encouraged to speak as much as possible.Marie A. Cannavo, a Northwestern graduate now employed there as an interpreter, said a deaf student who depended upon oral communication in a classroom could have problems if a teacher ''moves around, looks away or turns his back to write on the board.''Also, some words are almost impossible for a lip reader to distinguish between, she pointed out. ''Take the words 'pretty' and 'pregnant' - they look the same when mouthed and unless you add a gesture, you could cause a lot of confusion.''Miss Cannavo interprets microbiology classes and laboratories of assistant professor Edward P. Bollenbach for 20-year-old Diane Lariviere of Portland, Me. Miss Lariviere shares a Winsted apartment with Alycia Condon of Ledyard, a 19-year-old art student who is also deaf.Seated in a chair facing Miss Lariviere during a recent class, Miss Cannavo used her hands and facial expressions as she rapidly translated Mr. Bollenbach's lecture. At her side was Catherin Boone, a 28-year-old mother of two and a second-year interpreting student.Miss Lariviere, a B student in this course, answered correctly several of Mr. Bollenbach's questions in sign language, which Miss Cannavo translated into spoken English. Because of its complicated terminology, microbiology is one of the most difficult courses to sign, Miss Cannavo said. Interpreters are usually placed in courses where they have some background and Miss Cannavo's field of interest is science.Despite her handicap, Miss Lariviere, who plans to transfer to a four-year college and pursue a degree in medical technology, is among the best students in Mr. Bollenbach's classes, he said. ''Sometimes I think she anticipates what I'm going to say, she hangs on the interpreter's words so closely.''Rather than constituting a distraction, the presence of the deaf student and her interpreter ''create an atmosphere that is conducive to learning. Everyone is more attentive,'' said Mr. Bollenbach, who has had up to five deaf students in one class.Interpreting, said Miss Cannavo, is ''mentally exhausting.'' Mrs. Katz added, ''It requires not only stamina but also intelligence, confidence and an expressive personality.'' Interpreting spoken English into sign language ''is no different than from translating English into French or Spanish. It takes a lot of hard work and patience,'' she said.Students seeking entrance into the certificate program are screened each semester for proficiency in oral and manual communication and are given a written English examination. Would-be interpreters ''should be seriously interested in the mastery of the skill,'' said Mrs. Katz. ''We don't want people who are paternalistic and out to save the deaf world.''Before Northwestern offered Career Education for the Deaf, students coming out of the American School for the Deaf in West Hartford, the Mystic Oral School or public and private high schools in the state were faced with traveling long distances for an appropriate post-secondary program, Mrs. Katz said. Some enrolled at Gallaudet College in Washington, D.C., or at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at the Rochester Institute of Technology.Eight years ago, when Mr. LeBlond was a teacher at the American School for the Deaf, Northwestern students studying child development were placed in his classrooms as observers. Their interest in sign language led to Mr. LeBlond's teaching a night course on the subject. Hundreds of students and community members enrolled. ''The whole town,'' Mr.LeBlond recalled, ''was learning how to sign.''Regina M. Duffy, the college president, asked Mr. LeBlond where deaf students in the state were going after high school and if he thought they could be successfully integrated into regular college classes. Mr. LeBlond told her that that program could work ''if done right.'' Mr. LeBlond and Miss Duffy designed a starter program that was implemented in 1974 with six students and a one-year Federal grant from the Department of Vocational Education. To procure money to continue the program, Mr. LeBlond, flanked by some of the students and their parents, appeared repeatedly before the Education and Appropriation Committees of the Connecticut legislature.Career Education for the Deaf was entered as a $93,500 line item in the 1976 college budget. When Mr. LeBlond left his post as program coordinator in 1977, its enrollment had grown to 40 students from many states. This year, $135,250 is budgeted for the program and Mrs. Katz is requesting $141,500 for next year.She has a staff of 13 full and part-time interpreters plus an audio-visual specialist and speech therapist. About half of the interpreters hold certification from the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf. Only one interpreter is male, perhaps, said Mrs. Katz, ''because most men view interpreting as something only women do.''Since the implementation of Northwestern's program, a few Connecticut colleges have begun to offer courses in sign language and interpreting and to provide some support services for deaf students, Mrs. Katz noted. Connecticut, though sometimes accused of being lax in providing services for the handicapped, is relatively advanced in its acceptance of the hearing impaired, she said, ''probably because of the American School,'' which was founded in 1817.More than services and equipment, Northwestern has offered its hearing-impaired students ''a new beginning,'' according to Glen McDonnell, a 22-year-old Danbury resident who is studying park management and design. Mr. McDonnell owns a car, maintains a Winsted apartment and has worked part-time in a local factory.''When I came here I was afraid and easily frustrated,'' he said in sign language, as Miss Cannavo interpreted. ''I was used to deaf schools and deaf people.'' After failing his first semester courses three years ago, Mr. McDonnell is now a B student. ''I've learned,'' he signed, ''that I can make it on my own.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/us/phone-companies-on-coast-told-to-provide-free-devices-for-deaf.html", "headline": "Phone Companies on Coast Told To Provide Free Devices for Deaf", "date": "1981-01-25T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 25, 1981, Section 1, Page 22Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The salute is to hearing actors. During a dinner that will follow the performance, awards will be given to various people who have helped deaf actors in one way or another, including Jason Robards, Jacques d'Amboise, Merrill Brockway, Joe Layton and the feathery Big Bird of television's ''Sesame Street.''''Big Bird represents all the special people in the world that you learn to live with and love,'' explained David Hays, a set designer who was instrumental in founding the Theater for the Deaf at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn. Concept Evolved in 1950'sActually, the concept of a professional company of deaf performers evolved in the 1950's among Federal Government officials and a psychologist specializing in the deaf, Dr. Edna Simon Levine, who called on various hearing people in the theater, including Mr. Hays, to help. But plans never got off the ground.''The Government's idea was that a theater could be a terrific tool for a minority people,'' Mr. Hays recalled. It would help dispel misconceptions about the deaf - that they ''aren't smart, because they don't speak so clearly'' and therefore are not employable, for instance. ''People still say dumb things like, 'How can she be deaf, she's so beautiful?' or 'Do you give them scripts in Braille?''' Mr. Hays said. ''People tend to confuse the so-called handicapped, to homogenize them - and sort of freeze up when they see someone who is different from themselves.''He thinks the Theater for the Deaf has been instrumental in changing that image. ''There is a burst of sign-language instruction in the country. And on TV these days, you see in a little circle on the screen someone signing a news event or whatever. We took the stigma out of sign language.'' Troupe Won Tony in 1977The 15-member troupe, which won a Tony in 1977 for theatrical excellence, tours extensively abroad as well as in this country and offers educational services, including a school. It is also involved in advocacy for deaf performers. However, the prime focus is on performance. When Mr. Hays resurrected the idea of the company at the O'Neill Center in 1967, he told government officials that spin-off social benefits would be fine, but that theatrical excellence would be the main concern. And when Mr. Hays, who learned to sign after becoming involved in the theater project, mentions this or that achievement among the deaf, the reaction in the company, he said, is ''David, that's wonderful, but let's go back and do the play.''''The Iliad, Play by Play'' marks the first production by the troupe to use both a deaf writer, Mr. Mow, and deaf director, Ed Waterstreet. For the benefit of hearing members of the audience, three hearing actors on stage will speak lines of other actors who are signing.The play transforms the heroes of the Homer epic poem about the last days of the Trojan War into Super Bowl football stars of today. ''You see football stars on television, larger than life, in fabulous armor, and you wonder as you see these warriors, what the man is like underneath,'' Mr. Hays said. ''This to us is the metaphor for the 'Iliad.' There's a lot of comedy, but it ends up as tragedy.'' Mixes Its LanguageLike the original epic, the play focuses on the withdrawal of Achilles from the war and its effects on the Greek campaign, and it mixes the formal speech of Homer with colloquial modern language. Devices such as locker-room blackboard lectures help explain what is taking place. At one point, for example, Mr. Hays said, Menelaus, whose wife Helen has been abducted, tells a reporter how he came to marry her, explaining this and other events in terms of football diagrams.As a bonus, Mr. Hays said, ''We do the 'Odyssey,' too, an eightminute version, as a half-time show.''

This was done as part of its effort to comply with the spirit as well as the letter of state and. Federal laws compelling school districts to meet the educational needs of handicapped students,Although Tom could have continued his studies at the special school he attended at the district's expense, he, his parents, the district administrators and the school board decided that his educational and social needs could best be served if he transferred to the high school.\u201cThe purpose of the laws is to prepare these children, these students, to live with society in as close to a normal situation as possible,\u201d said the district superintendent, Dr. Richard Doremus. \u201cAnd this student just was not being prepared to do that. We owed it to him to do the most we could do to remedy that situation.\u201dBefore this year, Tom spent five hours a day traveling to and from school and to the Board of Cooperative Educational Services class he attended in Nassau County. But he, his parents and the district's committee on the handicapped felt that, besides broadening his social experiences, attending the high school would compel him to improve his lip\u2010reading skills.Last summer, the school board approved the move to hire Miss Koenecke, who had taught at the Cleary School for the Deaf. Dr. Doremus said he did not know exactly how much the district had agreed to pay her. He reported that the average salary for district teachers was $22,000 and that the  move would cost about four times as much as it had cost to send Tom to the special school.Virtually every school district in the state, like Shoreham\u2010Wading River, ,has handicapped students with varying degrees of physical or mental limitations. Recently the concept of \u201cmainstreaming\u201d \u2010 including handicapped students in regular schools and even regular classes whenever possible has been expanded.But a spokesman for the State Department of Education said that though mainstreaming had become more common, he knew of no other district that had hired a full\u2010time faculty member to work with a single student in a school.Through the schedule that has been devised for Tom, he and Miss Koenecke work privately on his standard academic courses, such as mathematics, language arts, social studies and current events. For this part of Tom's studying, Miss Koenecke serves as a tutor would. They work in a small room in the building equipped with a table, chairs and a blackboard. It is when Tom attends regular classes and Miss Koenecke assumes her role as an interpreter that the unparalleled aspect of the situation becomes apparent.One recent afternoon, Tom and the other students in his woodworking class spent the period working on their major projects. Donald Hicks, the class instructor, moved about, listening to questions and offering advice to the students on an individual basis.That day Tom was working on the squares for the surface of a chess table he was building. Mr. Hicks would speak to him as they worked, talking from an angle that would allow Tom to do as much lip reading as possible. Then Miss Koenecke would interpret exactly what Mr. Hicks had said and, if a response was necessary, the youth would speak, gesture or use sign language to convey his words through Miss Koenecke.In the woodworking class and in marine maintenance, the other class that Tom attends with other students, Miss Koenecke does not limit her translations to just the teachers or students who are communicating directly with him. She tells him \u2014 by using sign language and by speaking directly to him so he can read her lips \u2014 what the instructor is saying to the class as a whole, what other students are saying to the teacher and sometimes what they are saying to one another. Tom misses little of what is going on, including the joking.\u201cTom is here to be as much a part of everything that is going on in the school as possible,\u201d Miss Koenecke said, explaining that it was her intention for him to \u201chear\u201d everything that anyone in his position would hear.\u201cFor me to just tutor him and to tell him just what was being said in a lecture situation would not be as beneficial,\u201d she said. \u201cThe deaf have as much a right to communicate on all levels as anyone else.\u201dWith Miss Koenecke's help, Tom spoke a bit about the differences between his previous educational situation and this one. He said that even though his academic work at the high school was more difficult than at the other school, he did not mind it because he felt that he was learning more in a public school. But the best part about being at the high school, he said, was that it was just a lot of fun going to school with his brother and sister and his friends in the neighborhood.Norman Bussiere, the high school's principal, said the decision to bring Tom there had been good not only for him but also had had a positive effect on the other students.\u201cI'm proud of the way students here have responded,\u201d he said. \u201cOn one hand, they have treated him as they would any other student, but they have made an effort to communicate with him. Many students have expressed an interest in learning sign language, and I believe that some have even taken it upon themselves to learn it.\u201dAsked if the program for Tom was a temporary or limited one, Dr. Doremus said that ideally Miss Koenecke's position would be phased out, but that would happen only if Tom were able to communicate in the classroom without an interpreter.\u201cBut our commitment,\u201d he said, \u201cwill continue to match the needs of the students in the district, not just this student but any student who may have problems or limitations which could be helped with something new or different.\u201dThe New York Times /Jack ManningDelores Koenecke communicating with Tom Schneider at Shoreham high school"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/25/archives/fcc-moves-to-permit-paging-devices-for-deaf.html", "headline": "F.C.C.

Instead, when a deaf person was being summoned, his paging device would vibrate.The commission envisions the device as having its biggest application in a residential setting, allowing a parent to summon a deaf child who is outside playing, for example.The devices would be limited to a maximum power of 10 watts and thus would have a limited range, estimated at about a quarter mile. The two frequencies suggested by the commission's staff are now used by only about 220 licensees nationwide, the commission said, so the frequencies could be shared with little danger of interference.In announcing of the proposal, the commission said that it was also soliciting comments on a paging system that would provide visual messages, on a display similar to those used on digital watches and pocket calculators. Persons who are both deaf and blind might benefit from a paging receiver offering a braille\u2010type readout, the agency said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/20/archives/deaf-students-rehearse-with-choreographers-for-special-performance.html", "headline": "Deaf Students Rehearse With Choreographers For Special Performance", "date": "1979-10-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 20, 1979,  Page 10Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

But don't look as though you were directing yourself. That looks too neurotic. Do you know what neurotic means?\u201dWhile it was questionable that these typically irrepressible younsters really grasped the definition of neurotic, was clear that they understood dance \u2014 even though they are deaf and, for the most part, were following the choreographer's words by lip reading.Mr. Falco is one of 10 choreographers who are creating works to be performed by 37 deaf students, ranging in age from 7 to 22, on Oct. 29 at the Abraham Goodman Theater in the Hebrew Arts School at 129 West 67th Street. A dinner on the Promenade of the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center will follow. Proceeds of the event, entitled \u201cI Am in the World,\u201d will go to Rehabilitation International U.S.A., an organization that aids the physically disabled in a variety of ways.The other choreographers creating works and coaching students for the event are Jacques d'Amboise, Juan Antonio, Donald Saddler, Dennis Wayne, Jean\u2010Pierre Bonnefous, George Faison, Remy Charlip, Robert Weiss and Mercedes Ellington. In addition, Julie Andrews and Louis Jourdan will serve as hosts, Agnes de Mille, Eric Bruhn, Anthony Dowell and Maureen O'Sullivan will narrate, and professional dancers including Martine van Hamel, Carmen de Lavallade and Christian Holder will perform, by themselves and with the deaf students.Dancing With the HearingThe project of Rehabilitation International that the benefit is intended to aid brings established artists in various fields and talented disabled individuals together for lessons, performances and exhibits.\u201cI wanted to show that a hearing choreographer could take nonprofessional deaf children and turn them into dancers capable of good performances,\u201d explained Carol Connell, program development officer for Rehabilitation International. \u201cI also wanted to show that the deaf and hearing could work together. Up until now when the deaf have been taught to dance, it has only been with each other.\u201dThe 37 students were drawn from Gallaudet College in Washington, the world's only liberal arts college for the deaf, the Joffrey Ballet School for the Deaf and the Lexington School for the Deaf. Few had ever danced before in any context. Now, in addition to the performance in New York, they are booked for appearances in Puerto Rico, Paris and Tokyo.Mr. Falco and Shelley Freydont, dancer with the Twyla Tharp company who is helping him teach them, took pains to enunciate clearly and the 19 students rehearsing communicated by sign language. Otherwise, their impairment was hard to detect. Certainly it did not inhibit them in any way, and they appeared confident about their scheduled performance, even though they have only been working together since September.Kevin Hall, 17 years old, who had never danced before, observed: \u201cAt first I thought it would be too hard. But if you practice, you feel normal. I feel\u2019 good.\u201dAfter the rehearsal, Miss Freydont theorized that deafness could, in some ways, help inexperienced dancers. \u201cIt's a built\u2010in commodity,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey are used to expressing themselves visually, and they can open up more easily.\u201dStill, teachers of the deaf face obstacles: how to impart instructions and music to those who can barely hear, at all. Jacques d'Amboise, who has been conducting special weekend classes for deaf boys for more than a year and who is preparing a \u201cvigorous, freestyle jazz dance\u201d for 10 deaf boys and four hearing ones for the benefit, said: \u201cConveying the sense of timing is the most difficult component. The best way to do it is visually with a drummer. I establish the tempo that way at the outset and then tell them to do it twice as fast or twice as slowly.\u201dMr. d\u201dAmboise communicates with the help of a sign language interpreter and also expects his students to lip read.By contrast, Louis Falco found an interpretor to be an impediment. \u201cFirst the students would have to look at him, then at me,\u201d he said. Instead, he simply takes pains to enunciate clearly and demonstrate steps himself. \u201cI taught them movement by doing it over and over,\u201d he said, \u201cand I worked out movements that wouldn\u201dt be done by trained dancers but that are artisti cally plausible.\u201dRobert Weiss, a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, who has created a religiously inspired work set to Russian Georgian folk songs, is taking advantage of the fact that the five Gallaudet College students who will perform it communicate mainly through sign language. \u201cBecause they 'sign\u2019 so much, their hands are naturally very expressive, so I have them do a lot with the upper torso,\u201d he said.Mr. Falco agreed to undertake the project despite a rigorous fall schedule \u2014 he is currently working on a film entitled \u201cFame\u201d \u2014 \u201cbecause I was fascinated by the idea.\u201d\u201cI have come to believe that they are no different than anyone else except that they can't hear,\u201d Mr. Falco said. \u201cDance develops a need that they already have to express themselves.\u201dIn the month that he has been working with them several evenings a week, he said, \u201cthey have come to trust themselves.\u201d\u201cAt first they wouldn't think of throwing themselves on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they have a great sense of freedom and power.\u201dIn fact, at the rehearsal, he reminded them to wear long pants to protect their legs.\u201cJust because you're deaf, you don't have some terrible thing wrong,\u201d Mr. Falco said. \u201cThese youngsters should have an opportunity to study dancing and acting first\u2010hand with people in the field, and maybe because it will always be harder for them, more energy should go to them than to others. That is why I'm doing this.\u201dTickets for the black\u2010tie event are $150 and can be obtained at 869\u20109907."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/05/archives/friendly-town-couple-enrich-deaf-boys-life-they-wanted-a-special.html", "headline": "Friendly Town Couple Enrich Deaf Boy's Life", "date": "1979-08-05T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 5, 1979,  Page 37Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

But in his eight years some other things have gone against him. He comes from a low\u2010income family. He's deaf. And he doesn't sneak well.This summer Gregory got his first big break. He left the sticky city streets of the Bronx behind and spent two weeks at the seashore. There, in the hometown of his Friendly Town \u201cparents,\u201d Vivian and Leonard Dunning, Gregory experienced sea breezes, good food, frolicking in the water with new friends and trips to the amusement park.But there was more, for Leonard Dunning had something extra special to offer Gregory. Mr. Dunning is also deaf \u2014 \u201cprofoundly deaf,\u201d as he calls it, which means he can't hear at all, even with a hearing aid \u2014 and he understands what kinds of problems the child has. What's more, Mr. Dunning recently completed a master's degree in teaching deaf children, and will be teaching deaf youngsters of high\u2010school age in the fall.They Wanted a Special ChildThe Dunnings have welcomed Fresh Air Fund children into their homme before. But this time they wanted to offer their love, support, and even some education to a deaf child.They found Gregory through Pamela Galehouse, who directs the Fresh Fund's camping program and also places handicapped children with host families, and Mimi Staley, who has been interviewing Friendly Town parents in the Dunnings\u2019 area for 13 years.Miss Staley, who escorts the children to and from their Friendly Town families, said Gregory was \u201cremarkable\u201d in his outgoing attitude. \u201cHe was right in there, trying to communicate with the kids,\u201d she said. And when Gregory and his \u201chost lather\u201d spotted each other, Miss Galehouse said, they began \u201csigning to each other like mad.\u201dThen came the setback. Gregory was homesick. \u201cWe would hear him crying himself to sleep at night, and during the day, he'd be telling us every 20 minutes that he wanted to go home,\u201d said Mr. Dunning. \u201cI was climbing the walls and saying, \u2018Let's send him home.\u2019\u201dA Pact With the Family DogBut then, on the third day, the homesickness had gone. There were a couple of other minor adjustments. For one thing, Gregory and the family dog were terrified of each other, but Mr. Dunning said the boy and the dog \u201cmade a mutual pact of respect.\u201d And then there was Gregory's first encounter with a wave.\u201cHe split,\u201d said Mr. Dunning, describing how Gregory immediately bolted for cover. He was immediately comforted by Mrs. Dunning, and Pat Wood, a friend, neighbor and Fresh Air Fund \u201cmother,\u201d who has six childret, of her own. The two women coaxed the boy back to the ocean, and he was paddling about in it with his friends for the rest of his stay, Mr. Dunning said.At the end of his stay, the Dunnings accompanied Gregory to Penn Station, where he was greeted by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Furman Bird.\u201cIt was wonderful,\u201d said Mrs. Bird . \u201cI had no plans for him for the summer.\u201d She said the trip had been initiated by St. Joseph's, the Roman Catholic school Gregory has been attending.It costs the hind $54 to send a child to visit a family through the Friendly Town program. A $300 donation enables the fund to send a needy child to a Fresh Air Fund camp for two weeks. All contributions are tax deductible and may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 300 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

His early interest in sign language was sparked by seeing productions of the National Theater of the Deaf in New London.He believes that sign language, laragely unknown to most people, is a particularly expressive form of communication. In addition, he said, since hearing\u2010impaired people constitute a significant part of the population, the ability of others to communicate with them through sign language helps them feel less isolated.The prevalent philosophy now in the use of language for the deaf, he said, \u201cis to use everything you can\u201d \u2014 lipreading, hand signs and body movements. In addition, he said, \u201csign languageas a form of body expression liberates you, you no longer have to feel embarrassed to make gestures and faces.\u201d But he emphasizes that it is \u201cnot a game, it is serious .way to communicate with real people.\u201dThe success of the class last semester spread beyond the 75 students who were enrolled in it and the smaller class of more advanced students who have continued this semester. Even in Downey House, the campus pub, students can be seen conversing in sign language.Kim Kelly, a junior from Plymouth, Mass., said that the interest and enthusiasm did not stop with those who attended class. Other students are learning the signs and people in her dormitory have picked up some of the fundamentals from her.Several students attribute the enthusiasm and quick learning to the excitement that Professor Shapiro generates. He has taught them songs in sign language and throws in puns and slang words to keep his class laughing. One of the favorite sign words around campus is that for mother\u2010in\u2010law \u2014 thumb on the tip of the nose and fingers extended.This semester Mary Jane Newell of nearby Rocky Hill is teaching the advanced class. She believes it is important to teach such a course to students with normal hearing because it makes them aware of deafness and then they will not hesitate to associate with hearing\u2010impaired people. \u201cEveryone wants to understand others,\u201d she said, \u201cand as long as there is communication between people, does it really matter what method is used?\u201dThe type of sign language taught at Wesleyan is the precise Signed English that is taught to children. The students are also learning how adults adapt this to use a more simplified language that eliminates unnecessary words.One can say as much in sign language as in any other language, Professor Shapiro maintains, but it is necessary to be very precise because many words are similar to others. One student said she found this out when she wanted to us the symbol for \u201cembarrassed\u201d (rubbing the cheeks to indicate blushing) and instead, with a slightly different sign (the same gesture, more emphatically executed), used a sign that said she was a prostitute.As a result of its success this year at Wesleyan, the course in sign language will be added to the curriculum in the linguistics department next year.Some of the students are finding summer jobs at camps for deaf children. and teaching songs in sign language in their other classes and in neighborhood schools."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/12/archives/deaf-players-guide-lists-35-professionals.html", "headline": "\u2018Deaf Players\u2019 Guide\u2019 Lists 35 Professionals", "date": "1979-05-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 12, 1979,  Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

For the child born into a hearing home, as most are, however, there is profound difference. Hearing children are immersed in their language from the moment of birth. Without special training, they come to understand it within months and to speak it within year or so.The very rarity of deafness (only about one in a thousand school\u2010age children have a severe enough hearing loss to need special educational services), usually puts its victims into a world where, as far as the child can tell, there is no language.The most distinctive attribute of the human species, the very medium of intellectual growth \u2014 a built\u2010in capacity for language \u2014 remains cut off from nourishment.If you are a deaf child in a hearing home, your parents do not talk to you. There are no bedtime stories. Other children say nothing. Television is just pictures. Telephones are useless, and radio does not exist. You cannt ask for toys or even for a drink of water. When you are frightened, you cannot tell anybody. You do not even know that you have a name.No matter what happens in the subsequent education of deaf children, a language gap develops between them and the hearing world. It is with this gap that educators of the deaf must struggle.Beyond the certain but hard\u2010to\u2010define psychological effects, there is the elementary fact that deaf children enter school (whether public or special) having accumulated almost none of the miscellaneous information about their world that hearing children get from conversation and from television, radio or the movies.Even if the child learns sign language, there is another gap because sign language is not English. Although sign language was once considered by hearing linguists as only a clumsy approximation of spoken English kind of pidgin for the hands \u2014 linguists have now established that sign language meets every test for being a true language in its own right. It is now called American Sign Language, usually shortened to A.S.L. or Ameslan.Although there are often correlations between the denotative meanings of many words in Ameslan and English, commentative meanings can vary. This misleading resemblance can be source of confusion when the deaf and the hearing try to communicate on sensitive or abstract subjects.Part of the problem is that Ameslan words consist not just of hand gestures but also of facial expressions and even bodily contortions that can change the meaning of the gestured word. For example, the sign for \u201cproud\u201d can be interpreted as \u201csupercilious\u201d or \u201cnoble\u201d depending on facial expression. A deaf child can know both meanings use them correctly.and still unfamiliar with the English words.The deaf student who encounters the unfamiliar words when reading will either skip them br look them up in the dictionary and get one or two narrow definitions. Any connotations based on popular oral culture will be lost.In a sense, however, Ameslan is richer than English. Although there are no signs for the more obscure English words, those words can always be, spelled out with the manual alphabet. Ameslan can thus make use of any English word, but there are signs in Ameslan that have no ready English equivalent. Depending on the facial expression, one sign can mean \u201cOh, yes. see what you mean,\u201d or \u201cNo kidding!\u201d or \u201cIndeed?\u2019The two grammars also differ substantially in syntax and the designation of tense and mood. For example, where the English speaker would say, \u201cI went,\u201d the signer of Ameslan would produce three signs that, individually, mean: \u201cI go finish.\u201d To the deaf person, the third sign is interpreted not so much as a separate word as a suffix modifying \u201cgo.\u201dAll of these difficulties are compounded when the deaf student tries to learn how to write. The child must either be bilingual, writing with the grammar of a language he has never \u2022 heard or writing the equivalent of an ungrammatical English sentence.Although this language gap has, in the past, led some educators of the deaf to advocate abandonment of sign language in favor of intensive training in speech and lip reading, this so\u2010called oralist approach has never been very successful except with children who became deaf after having acquired spoken English. At best, lip readers say they can catch no more than a third of the words they try to lip read.As an alternative, some educators are now pushing an artificial language called Signed English. It uses many of the standard words, or signs, of AmesIan but puts them into the syntax of English and adds invented suffixes and prefixes to show tense, mood, etc.Signed English, however, is meeting. resistance from some deaf persons who have developed pride in Ameslan as a legitimate language.Deaf poets, song writers, and dramatists \u2014 all using Ameslan \u2014 have blossomed recently, rapidly enlarging a repertoire of artistic productions built on the rich expressiveness of thoughts. painted gracefully in the air. It is a culture of which the hearing world is largely deprived. Perhaps the best\u2010known example is the National Theater of the Deaf, a repertory company that has performed all over the country. Typically the group does a mixed program of poems and plays. Hearing members of the cast speak tile lines so that nondeaf people can keep up.Gilbert Eastman is probably the leading deaf playwright. Mr. Eastman is chairman of the drama department at Gallaudet College in Washington, the world's only liberal\u2010arts college for the deaf. His well\u2010known \u201cSign Me Alice\u201d is an adaptation of \u201cPygmalion\u201d in which a professor using a formal signed English tries to upgrade the language of a girl who uses Ameslan. The girl meets a boy trained in Cued speech, another artificial linguistic medium in which some deaf students are trained. The girl decides Ameslan is best.Gallaudet has its own theater group, as do a number of other larger cities. Even more common among the deaf are singing groups Who substitute rhythmic body motions and signs for the unheard music. One such group is Washington's The Joyful Sign.Although television could be an ideal mass medium for the deaf, little has been done with it until recently. Some deaf people are now working on programs in Ameslan with a voice\u2010over for the hearing rather than captioning programs designed for the hearing. A California group, Deaf Media Inc., has produced a TV series for deaf children called \u201cRainbow's End,\u201d that has been on several public TV stations.With what is almost an Ameslan cul tural explosion, the oralist approach to educating the deaf has lost influence. Gaining sway in most schools for the deaf is the \u201ctotal\u2010communication\u201d approach, combining sign language, lip reading and speech training.Contrary to the fears of the oralists, the use of sign language. appears to speed, not slow, the acquisition of oral skills. It is as if sign language reveals to the deaf child the fullness of language, so he can appreciate the value of a second one.Ironically, it is just as Ameslan culture is really coming into its own \u2014 an important step in improving schools for the deaf \u2014 that there is growing pressure to move deaf children from these schools into regular public schools. The pressure is coming from efforts to implement Public Law 94\u2010142, the Educa tion for Handicapped Children Act, which encourages educating handicapped children, so far as is practicable, with nonhandicapped peers.Traditionally the deaf have been educated apart from their age\u2010mates, in large, state\u2010operated residential schools. Many of these schools may have been started when handicapped people were relegated to isolated institutions, but many educators hold that the residential schools, now vastly improved, still make sense.One reason is that it is better to put together people who share a language than to isolate them in a world whose language they can rarely master. And, according to deaf educators, there is an economic problem: A town with 25,000 schoolchildren would have, on the average, about 25 deaf children, so providing adequate services would be financially out of reach.\u201cWithout a high degree of specialized support, the child with a profound hearing loss is not going to be able to do well in a mainstream school,\u201d said Michael Dininger, coordinator of a program at Gallaudet that watches over nationwide implementation of P.L. 94\u2010142.\u201cThere are many children with moderate degree of hearing loss who could, with some help, do well in public schools,\u201d Mr. Dininger said. \u201cBut what we're seeing around the country is feeling that the law requires all deaf children to be put into the so\u2010called mainstream. This is a misunderstanding of the law. It's our position that mainstreaming is not going to help a lot of kids who could do better in specialized schools.\u201dHowever easily the deaf and hearing \u2018worlds may appear to mix on the job or even within families, when communication is of the essence, the language gap can force people apart. Deafness, it would appear, is the one handicap that sets people off into a natural community of their own. \u25a0"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/22/archives/westchester-weekly-new-forms-of-expressions-in-teaching-the-deaf.html", "headline": "New Forms Of Expressions in Teaching the Deaf", "date": "1979-04-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 22, 1979, Section WC, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Some deaf people came to the performance\u201esaw the piece and liked it. It made me think about getting involved with the deaf and learning more about them, but I didn't see any opportunity then, and it ended.\u201dSeveral years later, almost accidentally, she became involved in working with the deaf, and now teaches a modem\u2010dance class for deaf teen\u2010agers and \u2022 adults at the Young Men's\u2010Young Women's Hebrew Association of midWestchester in Scarsdale.Dance didn't enter the 28\u2010year\u2010old dancer\u2010choreographer's life until she saw her first ballet at age 15. Parental opposition delayed the start of lessons for a year, and her first teachers at the Joffrey School told her she was'too old for ballet. Undaunted, she continued for another year, paying for her own lessons.Two weeks after her arrival at the University of Utah, where she planned to study modem dance, a skiing accident prompted her switch to architecture, The following year, Miss LaCerva returned to New York and thought she would try a combined architecture and dance major at Purchase. She auditioned successfully, and then learned that architecture would not be offered. Once again she found herself enrolled as a dance major.In 1976, Miss LaCerva and three friends formed the Dancers Company \u2014 the first company to come out of the university. To support herself then, she took jobs as a waitress and taught jazz dance at the \u201cY.\u201dAnother injury, this time to her back, convinced her that her career as a dancer was over. Hospitalized for a while and unable to support herself, Miss LaCerva found that she was eligible for a community service program for artists run by the county's Council for the Arts, which is financed through the Federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act.Soon after she started in the CETA project, Miss LaCerva mentioned to her supervisor that she might want to teach dance to the deaf, possibly at the New York School for the Deaf in Fanwood. An interview was arranged with Andrew Basnick, dean of students, who is deaf.Mr. Basnick, who had been affiliated with the National Theater for the Deaf, wanted to develop an arts program at Fanwood and responded positively to Miss LaCerva's idea. She told him that the only sign language she knew was what she had learned for her project. He promised to help her, gave her a textbook and told her to be there the following evening.\u201cWhen I got there, he had 30 lods and two counselors waiting. He left and there I was with these kids, 11, 12, 13 years old. The counselors warned me that they\u2010would be apathetic and not to expect anything Some beginning!\u201dLooking up sentences in sign language, she haltingly explained her\u2019 presence there and then just started to move. The students imitated everything she did. \u201cI couldn't believe that first night. There was, such a broad range of physical expression and an incredible memory for movement which other kids that age don't have. I thought, \u2018There's something there.\u201d\u2019She worked at Fanwood through last spring, teaching three classes a night twice a week. Teaching dance to the deaf is demanding for both students and teacher, she notes. In her class at the \u201cY,\u201d the students \u201csee\u201d the rhythm, closely watching the drummer beat time. Miss LaCerva uses sign language to explain movements and also .speaks for those who lip\u2010read. The concentration is intense.Among Miss LaCerva's many interests is the development of interdisciplinary approaches to the arts, such as combining dance and poetry.\u201cWe learned the first lines of a Willi\u00e2m Carlos Williams poem, \u2018When I Am Alone,\u2019 and we all signed it till we got the rhythm I think it's easier for the deaf to grasp the rhythm in terms of words, easier for them to conceptualize with the rhythm of the poetry.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/16/archives/one-man-is-killed-when-derelict-deaf-group-clash-in-subway-train.html", "headline": "One Man Is Killed When Derelict, Deaf Group Clash in Subway Train", "date": "1979-03-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 16, 1979, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

However, the circumstances are so sharply in dispute that the District Attorney refused to render a judgment and referred the case to a grand jury.There is no doubt, according to the police, that Henry Bell, a Georgia\u2010born vagrant, wielded the knife that killed James Pacheo, a 23-year-old Brooklyn man with severe speech and hearing impediments.But the version of the incident provided in elaborate sign language by the dead man's companions \u2014 who said Mr. Ben had attacked them for no apparent reason \u2014 was contradicted at virtually every turn by Mr. Bell, who maintained that he had acted in\u2010self defense after Mr. Pacheo and two friends had tried to rob him while he was asleep.The police said the incident occurred about 2:30 A.M. as a No. 7 train from Flushing, Queens, was pulling into the Queensboro Plaza station in Long Island City, where a Transit Authority police officer, waiting to board the train, found Mr. Bell, knife in hand and Mr. Pacheo dead at his feet, holding a number of the dead man's friends at bay.Name\u2010Calling Is AllegedAccording to his friends, Mr. Pacheo, who lived at 447 Warren Street in Brooklyn, was among a group of about 16 handicapped young men who boarded the train at the 61st Street elevated station after an evening at a Woodside social club that caters to people with speech and hearing defects.Mr. Pacheo and two companions had entered a rear car and were on their way to join the larger group in a forward car, they said, when they encountered Mr. Bell, who began making derogatory remarks, calling them \u201cdummies\u201d and shouting obscenities.When one of the three men, who has partial hearing, paused to relay the tirade to his companions with sign language, they said, Mr. Bell drew the knife and slashed out, cutting one of them on the hand.At that point, they said, they fled, holding a door shut against the pursuing Mr. Bell, who managed to push it open and slash Mr. Pacheo's throat.Defendant Gives His AccountMr. Bell, who said the incident began when he was awakened as the young men were trying to go through his pockets, reportedly acknowledged drawing his knife, slashing one of the men and chasing them from the car.He told the police, however, that he had not pursued them, but had tried to hold the door shut when they returned with other men from the forward car. Unable to hold the door shut against them, he said, he slashed out when it opened, cutting Mr. Pacheo.Faced with the contradictory accounts, District Attorney John J. Santucci referred the case to a grand jury, but or- dered Mr. Bell arraigned on a manslaughter charge.A police spokesman explained that the charge, under which Mr. Bell would be held without bail, was the only way to insure the homeless man's availability.Mr. Bell, whose calm, lucid speech contrasted sharply with such a deteriorated condition that he was required to undergo delousing before being put in detention, told the police that he had no home except the subways.Mr. Pacheo's family declined to provide information about him yesterday, but the police said a young man of the same name and age, a member of a street gang known as the Crazy Homicides, had been charged with rape, kidnapping and assault in 1975 after he and two companions had attacked two teen\u2010age girls on subway train in the Bronx.Allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges, that young man, whose nickname, \u201cMudo,\u201d is Spanish for. \u201cmute,\u201d was sentenced to up to seven and a half years in prison.Subway Riders Look On As Girl Battles a RapistA 13-year-old girl reportedly put up furious struggle against a young rapist on a Manhattan subway train yesterday afternoon as half a dozen passengers watched from an adjoining car but made no move to help her.According to the police, the assault began at the 163d Street Station of the IND and continued through two stops as the girl battled her assailant, who at one point tried to push her off the train.It was not until someone finally notified the conductor, whose emergency whistle alerted an off\u2010duty Transit Authority pol iceman, the police said, that the girl's ordeal ended at the 135th Street station.The officer, Russell Wallace, who had been riding on a forward car, said he had to push through a cluster of passengers gaping through a door window in order to rescue the girl, who had been trapped by the suspect in the otherwise deserted rear car.The suspect was identified as Gary Foster, 17, of 187\u201004 Foch Boulevard, Ozone Park, Queens. He was charged with attempted murder, first\u2010degree sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a minor.The assault came less than a day after a 23-year-old woman was raped by two men who abducted her at knifepoint as she was walking along a deserted passageway leading to the 190th Street station of the IND in Washington Heights about 11:30 P.M. Wednesday. The woman was taken to nearby Fort Tryon Park, where both men raped her before fleeing with her watch and purse.In other subway violence yesterday, Gary Farrell, 16, was arrested after he allegedly pushed 35-year-old Nehemiah Piender onto the tracks at the 149th Street station of the IRT in the Bronx. The victim was treated at Lincoln Hospital for back and head injuries.Associated PressHenry Bell, right, in custody of transit patrolman after arrest early yesterday"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/10/archives/letters-handicapped-pupils-burdened-needlessly-mayor-kochs-arrogant.html", "headline": "Letters; Handicapped Pupils Burdened Needlessly; Mayor Koch's \u2019Arrogant Air\u2019; A Protectionist Quota at the City Opera?; B.T.U.'s, Calories, Joules \u2014 and the Nanogram People Power; U.S. Intellectuals\u2019 Increasing Deafness to Anti\u2010Semitism\u2019", "date": "1979-03-10T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 10, 1979,  Page 18Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The most conservative estimates indicate that if the law were implemented at least 40 percent of the system's estimated total of 100,000 handicapped children could receive adequate education in their local schools. Another 4 percent might be served in clusters in_ or near their neighborhoods.Compliance with this law would not only have limited the need for busing \u2014 a notorious hardship for handicapped youngsters \u2014 but would also have created an environment in which a transportation emergency could be met without making handicapped children the victims.A plan could have been drawn up assigning handicapped children in groups to their neighborhood schools. There are almost 1,000 schools in New York City, many with empty classrooms. The special education staff working in central offices and programs could have been deployed, according to need, to the various districts for distribution to the neighborhood schools. Thus the great majority of the ambulatory handicapped would have been in school these past weeks, receiving the attention, services and love they are now being forced to do without. School personnel, from principal to teacher aide, could have risen to the occasion, providing the children with both educational programs and help in getting to nearby schools.Yet, faced with a clear emergency, the school system did not take this common\u2010sense approach. Accustomed to isolating handicapped students, our schools are unprepared to undertake the adjustments required to include children who are different.The experience of school systems which have tried to comply with the Federal law, as well as a few model programs in this city, indicates that this unwillingness to accept handicapped children is not inevitable. Most of these youngsters can be accommodated in or near their neighborhood schools if the effort and commitment is made.Is this not preferable to the hardship and bad feeling that have dominated the current crisis?To the Editor:Since taking the oath of the highest office in the City of New York, the Mayor has taken a hard, insensitive posture toward the economically and racially disenfranchised.By cutting back vitally needed community action programs, closing municipal hospitals and not investigating recent police abuses, he has agitated black and other minority leaders. Some have even called him a racist. Has he been wrongly judged?The Mayor is elected to represent the public interest, whether the public be rich or poor, black or Jewish. Since Mr. Koch has taken office, his toughness in fiscal management appears primarily to affect the lives of poor minorities. His arrogant air, a sort of \u201caccept it and shut\u2010up\u201d attitude, has an uncanny similarity, especially for blacks, to an American historical experience found during slavery.What is needed in a city like New York is a sensitive leader, one who can work with groups of many complexions. A leader who can make prudent cuts across the board \u2014 cutting even when it requires reducing salaries of top managers: a tough leader who can make a decision and have the backbone to bear criticism.It's a sad commentary that the current Mayor. Edward I. Koch, needs character building and leadership training.New York, March 1, 1979To the Editor:The incoming director of the New York City Opera, Beverly Sills, has just announced the company's plan to limit the proportion of foreign artists in its employ to 5 percent. Since it appealing loudly for public financial Fupport, the public ought to be alerted to what this policy implies.The limit on foreign singers is a protectionist quota on the temporary importation of a special skill category of labor.As some of the best available talent is turned away, the company's hiring practices will of necessity be less efficient and its output (performance) quality per dollar spent will be lower, to the detriment of the buyer\u2010consumers (the audience). While some American singers will experience improved employment and income opportunities, foreign singers will of course suffer income losses, and the global allocation of the heterogeneous human capital embodied in such labor (in the throat) will unnecessarily deteriorate.At the international trade negotiations in Geneva, the U.S. delegates have tried hard to persuade Japan to abandon her ill\u2010conceived \u201cbuy Japanese\u201d program. Is the New York City Opera now going to set an embarrassing perverse example through an operatic \u201cbuy American\u201d labor policy at Lincoln Center? How will American actors be able to complain about their difficulties in getting work permits in London?It behooves the United States, as a force for cultural and economic liberalism, to keep an open door for foreign artistic talent, even if we cannot negotiate an instant quid pro quo from our trading partners. The City Opera's new policies are a retrogressive step \u2014 politically chauvinistic, culturally isolationistic and economically protec tionistic.Associate Professor, Department of Economics, Fordham University Bronx, Feb. 28, 1979To the Editor:David Morris's Feb. 26 Op\u2010Ed article asking for adoption of a common unit to measure energy shows how metrification, which seemed like a good idea, has only added to the confusion.For years, engineers in the Englishspeaking countries used the British thermal unit, the well\u2010known B.T.U., to measure energy. The rest of the world used the calorie and ignored the more scientific but much smaller joule, When metrification became imminent, working engineers stood mute while our academic brethren imposed the joule upon us.To make the joule meaningful, prefixes were added. Thus the mega joule, which means one million joules. Perhaps Mr. Morris should also have mentioned the more euphonious gigajoule, meaning a billion joules. Gigajoule sounds like the name of an Italian movie star.My favorite of these new units is the nanogram.One nanogram is one\u2010billionth of a gram or 1C0 grams. This unit appears in the 1978 E.P.A. guidelines for emission standards from power generation stations as nanograms of pollutant per joule of energy input to the boiler,The public is unaware that Mork, the TV visitor from the planet Ork, is really saying \u201cone\u2010billionth, one\u2010billionth,\u201d or \u201c10\u20109, 10\u20109, when he greets us with \u201cnano nano\u201d (note that nano is the English spelling of the Orkian nanu).Although I live in New Jersey, I am here in Duluth assisting in the start\u2010up of a 60\u2010million\u2010B.T.U.??per\u2010hour coal gasification plant \u2014 or is it 15 million kilocalories per hour, or 63 gigajoules per hour, or 63,000 megajoules per hour? At least the time units are the same as before. Mr. Morris was right.Duluth, Minn., Feb. 27, 1979To the Editor:The surprise victory of Jane Byrne in the Chicago Democratic primary for the mayoralty indicates that the aroused voter can still influence government.The system continues to be alive and well. It works in Chicago, as it can in many other places, when the people are sufficiently motivated to go to the polls. The same was true of Proposition 13. It is a fair question whether it is the people who are indifferent or public officials who are unable or unwilling to take the lead.These days we are often told that conservation of energy does not work and that the fight against inflation is difficult because the people are indifferent. Should the blame not be laid at the feet of government at every level?Such failure of leadership could result in radical changes, if not upheavals It could hannen here too.West Orange, N.J:, March 1, 1979To the Editor:Prof. Richard Falk asserted in a recent Op Ed article [\u201cTrusting Khomeini,\u201d Feb. 16] that the news media have \u201cdefamed\u201d the Iranian religious leader by, among other things, falsely charging him with anti\u2010Semitism.Yet in his 1970 book, \u201cIslamic Government,\u201d Khomeini openly wrote. \u201cIt is our duty to shout at the top of our voices that the Jews and their foreign masters are plotting against Islam and are preparing the way for the Jews to rule over the entire planet. I greatly fear that by their own special methods, they will indeed realize their desired aims. It is because of our own weakness that we may wake up one morning and find a Jewish ruler dominating our country\u2014God forbid!\u201dIn God's name, if this is not antiSemitism, what is?Professor Falk concedes Khomeini's hostility to Israel but claims that the hostility is merely a result of Israel's \u201csupport of the Shah and its failure to solve the Palestinian question.\u201d If that were true. Khomeini would be equally hostile to Egypt, Jordan and Syria, which fit those criteria splendidly. Does Professor Falk honestly expect Khomeini to oppose diplomatic and trade ties with those states, or to entertain publicly those sworn to destroy them, or to break with Iraq for its persecution of Moslem Kurds?I fear that Professor Falk's failure to hear what Khomeini has actually said is symptomatic of an increasing deafness to anti\u2010Semitism among academics and liberal opinion\u2010makers that is beginning to frighten Jews like myself.A historic shift in percepti&ns about the perennial \u201cJewish question\u201d is taking place. Despite the horrors of the recent past, Israel's pariah status. official anti\u2010Semitism in the Soviet Union and neo\u2010Nazi revivals in several countries. Jews are no longer numbered among the select groups deemed to have a valid right to make claims on the conscience of the left.Where once public figures were careful to avoid even the semblance of anti\u2010Semitism for fear of liberal censure. today it is Jews who fret and agonize whether to go public with each new grievance, lest we provoke the now\u2010automatic response that we are being \u201coversensitive.\u201dWhy are Jews losing their liberal bonafides?Political and ideological considerations have placed nearly all the world's Communist and radical\u2010left movements in opposition to Israel. Conversely, Jewish protests against Soviet policies have been highly visible. In consequence, the once\u2010automatic identification of \u201cJew\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d (by friend and foe alike) has been broken \u2014 despite the continued dramatically left\u2010liberal voting record of U.S. Jews, the prominence of Jews on the intellectual left in the U.S., Europe and Latin America and the relatively socialist flavor of Israeli society.Though most liberals would wish to separate themselves from the extreme left, the latter's power to mold world opinion remains formidable. The cumulative effect of hundreds of carefully engineered denunciations of Israel by every conceivable U.N. agency, \u201cnational liberation movement,\u201d radical student group or other interest whose aims are viewed with sympathy by liberals is now apparent.Any charge against Israel, no matter how unsupported, is given credence and prominence by the print and broadcast media, while the factual rebuttals are ignored or treated with cynicism.

He enters. tomorrow night's free-skating segment of the junior men's event in second place.The most obviously pleased person was Michalowski, who is 20 years old and deaf since birth. He began clapping after the marks for his presentation were announced, his first performance to musical accompaniment in the national tournament.\u201cI'm just so excited,\u201d he said. \u201cI was disappointed with my footwork, but was very happy with my jumps.\u201dIn skating to the strains of Emerson, Lake and Palmer's \u201cTocacto,\u201d Michalowski's coach. Carol Witti Ueck, got him going with a wave of her right index finger.Then Michalowski was mostly on his own, looking toward her for direction only a couple of times. One time, she snapped her finger s\u2014 their signal to speed up the performance. At the conclusion of the music, she brought her right wrist down and his program was over.Michalowski, who reads lips and talks in a fairly easily understood monotone, was the leader in the event after yesterday's compulsory figures, a tracing exercise that has no musical accompaniment.He dropped into second place tonight after the short program, which contained seven required maneuvers. Brian Boitano of Sunnyvale, Calif., was first with 7 ordinals and 60.76 points, followed by Michalowski of Park, Ridge, Ill., with 15 ordinals and 58.76 points, and Patrick Hughes of Colorado Springs.Earlier today, the defending champion Charlie Tickner of Littleton, Colo., grabbed the lead after the compulsory figures'in the senior men's competition. He had first places on the cards of all seven judges for 7 ordinals and 96.20 points."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/23/archives/elisita-s-hill-66-of-california-aided-bilingual-education-of-deaf.html", "headline": "Elisita S.

As the goals of general education became more progressive. so, at a respectful distance, did those of the state schools. In the Nan's. for example, when the interest was In a protected trade and steady work. deaf students were taught to develop skills m printing. auto body and fender work, power sewing And ??? repair. The students had few choices, but they ??? have an advantage because they wer not affected by the shattering noise of these trdes. When college began to be Me goal for the larger society in the late 10's and early 50's, academic programs for the deaf were geared up, :ma in many places trades training lost its edge.Now the word is \u201cintegration\u2010or \u201cmainstreaming,\u201d and the schools for the deaf are being called ghettos; t heir programs, institutionalization and segregation Not that integration is a new idea. The integral ion of new and special groups into the larger society is part of a strong and consistent thread in the American experience. E pillrIblis 111114111. And deaf children 111 urban areas like New York and Chicago, where there have been large numbers of trained people to teach. were integrated into public schools at various times since the 19.10's.What is different this time is the scope and scale of the plan. Each state and each school district must have ran integration plan, in conformity with the Federal law, in effect by next September. For the first time, local school districts are being forced to accept the responsibility for the education of the deaf and all other handicapped children, and great numbers of deaf students are being guided into the public schools. This phenomenon is being cheered by some parents and education theorists and deplored by other parents and by psychohigists of deafness like Dr. McCoy Vernon of Western Maryland One of few considered with equal respect by both the deaf and hearing communities, Dr. Vernon calls mainstreaming a devastating arid destructive experience for huge numbers of deaf children.\u201d He stresses that \u201cmainstreaming, when optimal, will work for only 10 percent of these children.\u201d As mainstreaming goes into effect. many others are beginning to echo his concerns.The deaf constitute the only subculture whose members do not speak the same language as their parents. For most, American Sign is the language of social contact. State schools and the Washington, D.C.\u2010based Gallaudet College, the world's only liberal\u2010arts college for the deaf, teach in a combination of sign and speech called \u201ctotal communication.\u201d Mrs. Beery is more fortunate than most deaf parents because she has the vital contact with her deaf children that sign language provides. For the mainstreamed deaf child of hearing parents, there is a double isolation, first from the hearing world at school and then from his own parents. In most cases, he is further separated from people by his inability to read lips, since only 20 to 30 percent of a given message is decipherable on t he lips.It was the hearing parents of deaf children, who usually do not master sign, who created the pressure to effect a radical change in both state and Federal law. They were angry at seeing their children either refused admission to local schools and sent off to the state schools for the deaf or else pushed through zi system that gave them bus!,, work but no education. Their demands, codified into the legal jargon of P.L. 441\u201012. the Education for All Handicapped Children's Act, reflect the following convictions:Integnition serves both deaf and hearing children. Deaf children have been \u201cput away\u201d for years, out of the 111\u25a01111til ream of education and social \u2018Flits stifles their development and allows normal children to develop hostile attitudes and fears about them. Since the deaf child will have to get along in a hearing world, he should grim up interacting socially and intellectually with his hearing contemporaries. This integration also benefits hearing children, because they learn to appreciate that all people are different, with individual strengths and weaknesses. State institutions, besides isolating their students, foster dependency and promote cloistered behavior and !chi isyncrat ic attitudes. Mainstreaming. while wrong for the profoundly deaf or multiple\u2010handicapped, is an alternative. Each child should be evaluated on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis. To the greatest extent possible. the deal child should attend regular classes.Ardith Lehnerz, who has two hearing and three deaf children (one a foster child), and her husband, Don, vice president of the International Association of Parents of the Deaf, were leaders in the fight to pass P.L. 94\u2010142. \u201cIn 1968, the word was integrate. rhey told us \u2018Your child must grow up in a hearing world,\u2019 \u201c Ardith,ixplams. \u201cIt faded miserably ]in Colorado] because ???? teachers were not trained to handle an occasional deaf child in full classes of hearing youngsters. The kids were unprepared for the deaf student and he was isolated if not actualliy laughed at. There were no backup services, psychological or educiaamid, no special classroom materials for the child. I don't see where it is much different no\u2019t. With a population of about 7.5 profoundly deaf children in 10,o00 hearing. It means one deaf kid here and tine deaf kid there isolated in schools that are really not equipped to handle them.

While there is controversy over the best methods for teaching the deaf, many educators now believe in the total\u2010communication philosophy, in which sign language and speaking are used simultaneously to help integrate children with a hearing handicap into a normal environmentAt the, Dy\u2010Dee Preschool in Springfield, 3\u2010and 4\u2010Year\u2010old deaf children play and learn side by side with an equal number of children who hear normally. The teacher uses sign language and speaks at the same time, and all the children know at least a few of the manual signals.The two\u2010year\u2010old pilot program, one of the first of its kind in the state, is financed by the Bureau of Program Development and Education of the state's Department of Education. It is coordinated by the Springfield Board of Education and the Millburn School for the Hearing Handicapped.Unusual because it puts youngsters with normal and impaired hearing into the same classroom, Dy\u2010Dee (an acronym for Deaf Youngsters Deserve Early Education) also includes a parent\u2010infant program. It is free to participants, and there is a waiting list for children who hear normally.Threeand 4\u2010year\u2010olds attend classes five mornings or afternoons a week, while infants go twice a week with their paients.Three\u2010year\u2010old Matthew Safford has been in the parent\u2010infant program since his parents were told when he was 17 months old that he was profoundly deaf.Margaret and Leonard Safford of Pequarnnock began to suspect that their son was deaf when he did not \u201csay \u2018shoe\u2019 or \u2018sock\u2019 when I was dressing him, the way babies do when they reach a certain age,\u201d Mrs.Safford said:\u201cEveryone said boys are slow and you can't compare them,\u201d she added. \u201cMy little girl, Aileen, who is 5, talked so early.\u201dSince Matthew began seeing Anita Dee, a speech pathologist at the school, he is learning how to use sign language. By fitting the child with a monofonator \u2014an amplifying machine equipped with a headset, microphone and vibrator\u2014she has developed an awareness in the child of his voice.\u201cPart of my role is to involve the parents, because they are a child's first natural teacher and it is important that they can connnunicate,\u201d Mrs. Dee said. \u201cWe think of signing as beautiful, but children are also encouraged to use their voices.\u201dAccording to Mrs. Safford, Matthew now has 250 words in his signing vocabulary. \u201cHe can tell me if he's thirsty or sick,\u201d she said.\u201cHe can lip read some things. There is a lot less frustration in his life.\u201dBesides Mrs. Dee, the teaching staff includes Evelyn Rispo, the teacher coordinator, and Susan Bast, the preschool teacher. To the casual observer, the preschool classroom looks and sounds like any nursery school, except that the teacher and the children are using sign language as they speak.A typical day begins with \u201ccalendar time,\u201d when Mrs. Bast asks the young sters what day it is, what the weather is like and, finally, which activities they would like to participate in. They may color or draw, play with blocks, have a tea party or take a doll for a walk in the carriage.Youngsters are expected to pick up their toys after the teacher signals the end of the play period by turning off the light to get the attention pf the deaf children and then signing that it is cleanup time by sweeping a hand across her palm and pointing to her watch.The period of recall is important for language development, according to Mrs. Dee. \u201cIf the children do not have a language,\u201d she said, \u201cthey don't think in words, so it's hard to remember things. So the children tell what they did during play time.\u201dAfterward, there are group activities, such as making puppets or baking cookies. All the children become involved in weighing and measuring, smelling and touching the ingredients and, of course, tasting.According to its staff, Dy\u2010Dee aims to provide normal and handicapped youngsters with pre\u2010academic activities. The program attempts to promote interaction between the handicapped and children who hear normally and to develop language skills in deaf children comparable to those in other children their age.In the past, the controversy over deaf education has centered on which methods are best. Some people advocate the oral method, which involves teaching the child to speak and read lips. Others advocate signing, the manual language.The main disadvantage of the oral method is in teaching someone who can not hear to talk. Speaking becomes a memory game, and it may take days to teach a child a single word.In the past, sign language was often frowned upon by parents of deaf children (90 percent of whom hear). But today there is a tendency toward combining the two methods. Some teachers feel that, because hearing\u2010handicapped children live in such isolation, they should use every aid they can to communicate.Jeffrey and Patricia Levitt, who learned that their son, Michael, was deaf when he was 5 months old, are learning how to sign at the Dy\u2010Dee Preschool. Since last March, 22\u2010month\u2010old Michael has been seeing Mrs. Dee, who works with him on the monofonator and teaches him signs.\u201cAt one point,\u201d she wrote in an early report on Michael, \u201cit seemed that he pointed to his throat when he vocalized to show that he was aware of using his voice. Then he wanted us to applaud.\u201dParents are invited to participate in the meetings, workshops and conferences planned by the staff. There also are parent\u2010counseling services and occasional field trips; recently, the children, their parents and the teachers visited the Turtleback Zoo in West Orange.To attend the school, children who hear normally must live in Springfield, but hearing\u2010handicapped youngsters from Union, Essex, Morris, Middlesex, Somerset and Hudson Counties are eligible. Those interested should call William C. Fallon, principal of Sandmeier School in Springfield and director of the Dy\u2010Dee Preschool, at (201) 379\u20105977. Classes will resume this week.The Levitts moved from Barnegat to Kearny so that Michael could qualify for the program, and Mr. Levitt took a transfer in his job.\u201cWe liked the interaction between the kids here and the total communication,\u201d Mrs. Levitt, a pediatric nurse, explained. \u201cWe looked at a lot of schools. When you find out that your child is deaf, it really changes your life. You'll move, change jobs, anything. You want the best for your child.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/17/archives/judge-orders-college-to-provide-interpreter-for-a-deaf-student.html", "headline": "Judge Orders College to Provide Interpreter for a Deaf Student", "date": "1977-07-17T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 17, 1977,  Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

At that time, more than 80 percent of all visually impaired children were enrolled in such institutions; by 1973 the figure had dropped to 35 percent. The other 65 percent were attending regular classes in local schools.This change was mainly the result of the equal\u2010opportunity emphasis of the Supreme Court of the 1950's and the 1960's. State laws providing for the education of the handicapped had never been strictly enforced. School districts were now faced with Federal mandate that handicapped children had a constitutional right to an education equal in every possible way to that of other children.Equally important, the Federal Government underwrote innovative programs and the training of people to be specialists. Representative of these model programs is one developed by the schools in Montgomery County, Md., near Washington, D.C. The program serves as a Federal demonstration project and influences other schools throughout the country. A product of both Federal funding and modern child development theories, the essence of its approach is to get to the blind child early and prevent its isolation and subsequent withdrawal.The work of Piaget, Gesell, Skinner, Erickson, and Havighurst, all household names in America's psychologically oriented culture, has provided the theoretical basis for this educational revolution. According to these empiricists, one doesn't just know things \u2014there are no innate ideas, as Plato instructed. One learns, in response to sensory stimulation, and progresses from one stage of development another. There is no automatic compensation for lack of vision by the overdevelopment of other senses as has sometimes been theorized. Instead the other senses may also remain underdeveloped, and permanent intellectual and emotional damage may result.The Montgomery County program, developed under Dr. Rosemary O'Brien, begins with home visits by vision specialists and social workers who show parents how to help their blind baby by holding him and talking to him a great deal and providing as much other \u201cnonvisual stimulation\u201d as possible.At age 2\u00bd or 3 the child is enrolled in a preschool classroom whose working hypothesis, that a blind child treated as sighted will develop more than one treated as blind, seems to work. A visitor to the classroom is struck by its normality. The teacher and aide totally ignore the rough and tumble of two little boys, blind, wrestling on the floor. Several children climb a ladder to a three\u2010foot platform, then launch themselves down a slide, shooting across the room. The children are expected to take their knocks.There are of course reminders that the children are visually impaired, such as the girl poking at her eye with her forefinger and rocking back and forth while sucking her thumb (traditional \u201cblindisms\u201d which are attempts at self\u2010stimulation) and boy, nose down on a puzzle, feeling the large pieces into their slots. The teacher and the aide talk to the children a great deal, explaining, praising, prodding. The child exhibiting the blindisms is singled out repeatedly. The tempo of the class from activity to activity is very fast, and there is an unusual intensity and a great deal of interaction. In addition to language or audial stimulation, the program prepares children for Braille through development of their tactual awareness.Because of the small numbers who are blind (only .1 percent of the population ages 5 to 17 is visually impaired), students have been easily integrated into regular classrooms, if they are ready, at about age 5. A traveling teacher who is also a vision specialist visits each county school daily to teach Braille and to consult with and advise the regular classroom teacher. The child is also taught the use of the typewriter, special study skills and orientation and mobility skills using a cane.New technological aids (many the result of Federally funded research) are making it easier for the older child to learn. The optacon, a reading machine that sells for about $3,000, is used in the larger public school systems. It is a small electronic camera that is held in one hand and, when focused on print, translates it into a sharp pulsation felt in the index finger of the other hand. With the optacon, a child is able to follow along with regular classroom assignments reading up to 80 or 90 words a minute. Often with Braille books, by the time the blind child finds his place, the class has finished the lesson.Another extremely promising camera\u2010type device, not yet generally available, converts print to sound, and operates along the lines of a photocopier, producing a computer voice and speaking at a rate of 150 words a minute. It now costs $50,000, but ultimately is expected to sell at about $5,000.Some researchers assert that only the most intelligent of children can learn to discern the sound information from sonar aids and that only about 5 percent of the blind are able to use them. According to some knowledgeable observers, blind adults often resist learning to use electronic equipment.In spite of the new programs, the new technology and the new specialized personnel and curricula, however, it seems fair to say that a number of visually impaired children, particularly those with multiple handicaps, will remain unserved. But for those bright blind children who have supportive parents and are lucky enough to be in a school system that can afford to pay for the new programs, a new age may have begun."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/15/archives/there-is-controversy-over-best-methods-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "There Is Controversy Over Best Methods for the Deaf", "date": "1977-05-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 15, 1977,  Page 156Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

They said: \u201cAt first we were plunged into blackness. We didn't know what to do. There is no book that tells you how to raise a deaf child.\u201d In fact, the Wrights discovered, there has long been a divisive controversy among experts over the best way to educate a deaf child.The Wrights\u2019 daughter Joan, now 12, was born not long after her mother had become ill with rubella, or German measles, during the epidemic of 1964\u201065. When the disease occurs during pregnancy, it often causes deafness in the child the mother is carrying. That was the case with Joan. When the Wrights learned she had been born deaf, they began a search, which still continues, for the kind of educational program that would help their daughter develop to her fullest potential.Some people, they found, advocate the oral method, which involves teaching the child to read lips and to speak, and others a method called signing, which is manual language. Today, a third method, cued speech, a compromise technique that uses hand signs and oral clues to improve lip reading skills, has compounded the controversy.The Wrights, who can hear, like 90 percent of the parents of the deaf children in the United States, finally decided that their child should learn the oral method, historically the method favored by most hearing parents. They felt that since the child lives in a hearing world, he must adapt to it\u2014and looks more normal.The great disadvantage of the method is the difficulty of teaching someone who cannot hear to speak. For the deaf child, speaking. is a memory game in which he must learn how to make the appropriate nasal or vocalizing sound, how to accent words and phrases correctly, how to control breath, pitch and volume, and how to form and place the tongue\u2014all of this with little or no sound feedback. It may take days to teach a child one word.On the receiving end, reading lips is most guesswork. By looking in the mirror anyone can see the difficulty of distinguishing between sixty or sixteen, or mat, bat or pat. Many experts feel that only the child who loses his hearing after learning to speak, or one who has enough residual hearing to make effective use of a hearing aid, can master speech to the level where it can be understood.In the past, there was a prejudice against sign language. Steve Weiner of Brooklyn, now a junior at Galiaudet College, a private, Federally funded liberal arts college for the deaf in Washington, D.C. recalls that \u201cstudents were treated like inferior human beings if they were caught signing\u201d at the oral school he attended some 10 years ago.Today, however, according to a recent survey of 1,000 day and residential schools for the deaf, there is a marked trend to what is referred to as Total Communication, essentially an attempt to combine the methodologies. According to the Total Communication philosophy, certain situations require signing. others require speaking and some necessitate both simultaneously. And this may vary at different developmental stages, Because the deaf child lives in such isolation, it seems crucial that he use every possible form and method to aid him in communicating. Educators of the deaf say that people are now more accepting of handicapped people, and many hearing people are now willing to learn signing to communicate.Another decision that parents like the Wrights have to make is whether or not to send their child away to a residential school, to a day deaf school or to a regular school, that is, to \u201cmainstream\u201d her. Because the Wrights wanted Joan to live a normal life with normal children, they opted to send her to a regular school, but they also hired a trained teacher of the deaf to tutor her daily.The magnitude of the retardation of language development can be illustrated by the fact that may take from 12 to 15 years of schooling for the average deaf child to reach a fifth\u2010grade language and reading level.A deaf child faces a considerable handicap in the regular classroom. Because spoken communication often eludes him, he is left out of much activity. If the teacher's back is turned, he doesn't even know anyone is speaking. Because his language development is low, he is likely to withdraw when the pressure gets too great.Speaking in favor of the residential school Brooklyn\u2010born Brenda Liebman, a junior and the Gallaudet homecoming queen last fall. Like Steve she also attended deaf, oral and public schools. She says she learned a lot academically at the oral school she attended. \u201cBut in regular school I felt inferior to other people, and I could never hope to be cheerleader. In the residential school I was one, and I was also in many other activities.\u201dSteve Weiner offers his educational plan. \u201cIt would be good for small deaf children to start in a day school that uses both oral English speech and sdgn language so that they might be with their families. But an adolescent would rather be with his peers. It's the residential school that may make him a normal person.\u201dThe discussion of the relative merit of the various kinds of schools may be a moot point when the Education of All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 becomes fully effective. The law mandates that all handicapped children ages 3 to 21 be served by 1980 in the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d educational setting. There are currently 57,000 enrolled in special programs for the deaf, and according to estimates, not census figures, 156,000 are unserved. About 148,000 of these may be hard of hearing who are receiving no special services, or institutionalized mentally retarded or emotionally disturbed children.Existing private deaf schools have been put on notice by spokesmen for the United States Office of Education to think in terms of \u201cmainstreaming\u201d their deaf students into programs with hearing students where possible. Yet many educators of the deaf fear that unless adequate services and personnel are provided, mainstreaming could be a disaster for the deaf student. For example, the American Federation of Teachers has recommended a ratio of eight deaf students to one trained teacher, a ratio unlikely to be achieved. One authority even goes so far as to predict that there will he a parental backlash and immense disillusion within 3 to 5 years. Not only does he feel that more has been promised than can he delivered, but that \u201ca whole generation of deaf students are going to be guinea Digs.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/21/archives/networks-rejected-signlanguage-plea.html", "headline": "Networks Rejected Sign\u2010Language Plea", "date": "1977-01-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 21, 1977,  Page 32Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Corman, Democrat of California, and Barry Goldwater Jr., Republican of California.They had written the networks saying that millions of Americans would more fully appreciate the inauguration ceremonies if a sign\u2010language interpreter was added to the telecasts, either by split screens or superimposition techniques.Ellen Morgenstern, a legislative assistant to Mr. Corman, said NBC and CBS executives contended that there were only 350,000 to 375,000 totally deaf persons.

As the star of the Mill Neck basketball squad Sellick is averaging 27 points and 17 rebounds a game this year. The majority of Mill Neck's opponents have no deaf players. Last season's schedule included a game against Long Island Lutheran in which Sellick scored 29 points.Ineligible to compete as a senior because he is over the age limit at 19, Brown led the football team at the North Carolina School for the Deaf in Morganton to the No. 1 ranking in the nation among deaf schools in 1975.

In his spare time he made the deaf allAmerica basketball team.A Different Kind of HandicapBoth youngsters may never compete on the college level.\u201cA coach learns that Danny is deaf and they become handicapped,\u201d said Dennis Tobin, athletic director at Mill Neck. \u201cThey can't see or hear about his talent.\u201dDon Westmoreland, who runs the athletic program at the North Carolina School agrees. \u201cWhen you say deaf\u201d to a collegg coach he gets scared,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Craig could hear, he'd be up to his neck in interested coaches.\u201dThe only school that has contacted Brown is Lenoir\u2010Rhyne in nearby Hickory, N. C. But the college, which runs a program to train hearing students to work with the deaf, hasn't contacted him in months.\u201cI can't understand it,\u201d said Westmoreland, a Lenoir\u2010Rhyne graduate. \u201cEvery time I speak to them they are real friendly, but they get evasive when I mention Craig.\u201cNaturally, being deaf is a handicap and a school would need an interpreter to help Craig get by academically,\u201d Westmoreland continued. Ohio State and other big schools bring in millions of dollars from their sports programs. They could easily spend $10,000 for an interpreter to land a superior athlete.\u201dOnly a few deaf athletes have attended and competed at hearing colleges and only one deaf football player, Bonnie Sloan, made it to the National, Football League. Sloan, a defensive tackle from Austin Peay College in Tennessee, played four games for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1973.\u201cUnfortunately, deaf people are stigmatized,\u201d said Westmoreland. \u201cWe still get called a deaf\u2010and\u2010dumb school, and people don't mean mute. A deaf person today would rather be slapped in the face than called dumb.\u201dThe University of Vermont is the only hearing school interested in Sellick. Efforts made by phone this week to get a confirmation of Vermont's interest in him resulted in \u201cwe'll\u2010getback\u2010to\u2010you\u201d responses.Sellick, 18 years old, is an excellent lipreader who communicates very well without an interpreter. The bristlyhaired, 6\u2010foot\u20102\u2010inch, 190\u2010 pounder is an all\u2010round player. He developed exceptional jumping ability with weight training and by running barefoot on Long Island beaches. He has never dunked the ball in a game because his coach, Mike Rosenbaum, has threatened him with 500 laps of running if he misses.Only One MishapSellick has had trouble in the hearing world only once. \u201cI went to a summer basketball camp after my freshman year at Mill Neck,\u201d he said. \u201cThe football coach from New York Military Academy was there and recruited me as a fullback and linebacker.\u201dSellick didn't make it through basic training, returning to Mill Neck after two weeks. \u201cI played all right, and the people were okay; but the military way of life just wasn't for me.\u201dHis way of life includes acceptance in a hearing world. Tobin, his athletic director, indicated the youth was up against quite a barrier.\u201cLast year I was called to testify on behalf of an athlete with a slight hearing impairment who had been barred by his school from interscholastic football,\u201d said Tobin. \u201cThe judge upheld the school, saying he might risk further impairment of his hearing.He Dreams of Future\u201cInjuries are a risk in any sport, but to blame an athlete's hearing handicap is ridiculous. We play 90 percent of all sports against hearing schools. The worst injury we have had was a cut over the eye of one of our players from a hearing opponent's elbow.\u201dThere is yet to be a court ruling barring players with elbows.Regardless of his academic future, Sellick is anticipating an exciting summer. He is the only high school basketball player ever to be chosen to represent the United States in the deaf Olympics. The XIII World Deaf Games, to be held in Bucharest, Rumania, in July, is a carbon\u2010copy of the regular Olympic Games down to its Romannumeral designation.\u201cI was surprised when I was picked,\u201d said Sellick, who was born with a nerve disorder that caused his deafness. \u201cNow I dream of playing in the hearing Olympics in 1980.\u201dFor Brown and his North Carolina teammates, the only thing to look forward to is the school's annual awards dinner.\u201cWe give all our athletes 22\u2010inch trophies,\u201d said Westmoreland. \u201cThe school says I'm wasting money, but its probably the last sports award they are going to get.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/02/archives/a-dialogue-even-of-the-deaf-foreign-affairs.html", "headline": "A Dialogue Even of the Deaf", "date": "1977-01-02T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 2, 1977,  Page 123Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Muammar el\u2010Qaddafi, President of the Libyan Arab Republic, cabled him offering \u201cto foster relations of cooperation\u201d with the new Administration.Colonel Qaddafi, who is also chairman of Libya's Revolutionary Command Council, stressed Carter's \u201ccall for the observance of spiritual values.\u201d He hoped this would lead to an attitude \u201cbased on equal footing and mutual respect\u201d helping \u201cthe cause of peace, security and justice.\u201dWarmer relationships would certainly constitute a change; right now they are limited and cold. The last United States ambassador left here in 1972 after Wheelus Air Base had been closed and American oil companies were nationalized by Qaddafi's revolutionary regime. Since then our embassy staff has been restricted to 15 persons and is headed by a charg\u00e9 d'affaires,There has been clear hostility to the United States and sparse diplomatic access to the Government by its representatives. Although some 2,000 Americans virtually operate Libya's booming oil production, they are cut off from the local population which is quite xenophobic by tradition and deliberately isolated from foreigners.However, recently Tripoli has taken an initiative to improve relations. It proposed opening a dialogue, ending numerical restriction of embassy staffs, and exchanging ambassadors. It even named a new envoy to America but he was not accepted by Washington which, on its part, made no move to reciprocate.Moreover, although Libya wished to buy United States arms and en initial purchase of eight Lockheed C\u2010130 transports was paid for, Washington blocked their export. The \u201cdialogue\u201d offer was cold\u2010shouldered. We do hundreds of millions of dollars worth of commercial business here, buying onefourth of Libya'ss oil and selling much agricultural machinery and civilian aircraft; but diplomatic business is stalled.I discussed all this at length with Colonel Qaddafi in a Bedouin tent outside this city. Our conversation was interpreted by Dr. Tahar Sherif bin\u2010Amir, Minister of State to the Presidency, but Qaddafi, who speaks considerable English, occasionally interrupted in that language and answered most questions without awaiting translation into Arabic.The nub of what he said was this: \u201cI believe in dialogue as a means of understanding. We are ready for a dialogue; the higher its level, the more effective the result. But this can be gradually approached. The ripe opportunity will be after President Carter takes over. I am relatively optimistic.\u201dNevertheless, burning issues still separate the two countries. Colonel Qaddafi resents Washington's assertion that he encourages terrorism abroad, from the Middle East toNortheni Ireland and the Philippines. \u201cWe are the only country in the world with a stiff law against terrorism,\u201d he insists.He acknowledges continued moral and political support for the I.R.A. in Ulster because that is \u201can integral part of Ireland and the Irish nation is different from the English nation. Why, even Scotland now wants its in dependence. But we give only moral and political\u2014not material\u2014backing as we do to other just causes.\u201dThe most troublesome point is Israel. Colonel Qaddafi strongly opposes American policy there. He says: \u201cI don't consider the idea of a Geneva peace conference worthwhile. We must return to the original point in settling this problem, We must go back to the Palestinian population of Arabs and Oriental Jews in 1947\u201048 and accept their coexistence in any form they desire. Anything else, I consider aggression.\u201dThat obviously implies return of all Arab Palestinian refugees and their families, exodus of most of Israel's Jews, and destruction of their state. Such an extreme solution \u2014 which would certainly provoke war if attempted\u2014is strongly opposed by the United States and many other countries, although Qaddafi denies this. Even several Arab lands now accept recognition of an independent and much larger Israel as part of a settlement.There seems little room for compromise between the American and Libyan views on this\u2014no more under Carter than under Ford. But this should not prevent the dialogue Qaddafi seeks.On the contrary, were we to end our ambassadorial boycott and send new envoy, ultimately beginning frank talks, it might be possible to disagree on Israel while finding common ground on certain other issues.It is more important to have ambassadors in countries where we have problems than in lands where everything is roses. Dispatching an envoy to a capital with which we have poor diplomatic relations is not a sign of approval\u2014but of interest and concern."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/21/archives/new-jersey-opinion-easing-the-lot-of-the-deafblind-helping-the.html", "headline": "Easing the Lot of the Deaf\u2010Blind", "date": "1976-11-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 21, 1976,  Page 446Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

But today's trainees are being helped by electronic innovations undreamed of in Miss Keller's day at the turn of the century.The $7.5 million center is believed to be the first facility designed specifically for the rehabilitation and vocational training of persons who can nei. ther see nor hear.When a visitor presses the doorbell outside a deaf and blind resident's room, the push button activates an oscillating fan and the surge of air alerts the resident that he or she has a caller.\u201cYou know, a problem you might. not think of,\u201d said Harry \u2018J. Spar, the associate director, \u201cis getting up in the morning when you can't hear an alarm clock. We have the alarm connected to a vibrator attached to the bedsprings. After the alarm sounds, the bed is vibrated constantly until the alarm is shut off.\u201dPush buttons both outside and inside the elevators arc labelled in Braille. Inside, eight panels of buttons are spaced 20 inches apart so that each passenger can keep his finger on the floor indicator button until it automatically pops out again when he reaches his floor.\u201cWe wanted a design that would assure us safety and convenience without creating a peculiar environment,\u201d said Mr. Spar, who himself is blind, but not deaf. \u201cWe didn't want an environment that would be significantly different from any other building that the people would be living in after they leave here.\u201dAt stairways, both the carpet underfoot and the handrails signal the ups and downs. At the head of each stairway, steps of recessed carpeting indicate the first descending steps. So do strips of tape on the rails that continue past the bottom steps. The end of therail signifies that no steps are ahead. Mobility is encouraged even further. Outdoors, there is a roller\u2010skating rink encircled by a jogging track. Waisthigh rails serve as guides.\u201cOrdinarily, the deaf\u2010blind have little opportunity to engage in vigorous activity,\u201d Mr. Spar said. \u201cThey can't very well jog up and down the street. The opportunity for release of emotions through exercise has a value that goes far beyond jogging or skating.\u201dA gymnasium affording regular workouts also helps to release tensions as well as to build stamina, he said. The gymnasium floor slopes upward at the edge to forestall collisions with the walls.Although the concrete sidewalks between the buildings are electrically defrosted, other walkways serve to familiarize trainees with gravel, bricks, dirt and other conditions they will encounter outside the center.\u201cThese are used in a preliminary course for learning how to travel independently,\u201d Mr. Spar said. \u201cOne we call an obstacle course. It is bumpy and curved and has a rock in the middle. We even have a sidewalk with a driveway so they can get used to avoiding parked cars and to expect someone backing out. Eventually the trainees go into town with an instructor to use public transportation.\u201dThe center consists of a training, research and administration building, residence and a vocational building on 25 acres at III Middle Neck Road. It formerly was the site of the United States Naval Training Device Center and was donated by the Federal Government.Funds are provided through the Rehabilitation Services Administration of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The director is Peter J. Salmon, administrative vice president of the Industrial Home for the Blind, which operates the center.Because the trainees are deaf and therefore unable to give voice commands, they cannot use seeing\u2010eye dogs.\u201cMany of the deaf\u2010blind, because of limited language, end up in schools for the retarded or mentally ill, when they are neither retarded nor mentally ill,\u201d Mr. Spar said, \u201cWe have quite a few here who were taken out of those settings. The sooner we get them, the higher the degree of restoration is possible.\u201cOccasionally we have one who literally has no language. He doesn't know his name, the day or the year. He has no vehicle for carrying his thoughts. It's a slow process to get them to develop a language\u2014and by that, I don't mean a vocabulary, but some means of communication.\u201dMr. Spar added that if a person loses hearing after he has acquired speech, he still can think in terms of words.\u201cBut those congenitally deaf have no concept of sound and his verbal speech is different,\u201d Mr. Spar said. \u201cHaving no sight or hearing at all, and no concept of speech, it is much more difficult to get a language.I'd estimate that 50 percent of our people here are victims of what's called Usher's syndrome. They were born totally deaf and with an eye condition that begins to manifest itself by the age of 7 or 8. Acuity does not diminish, but the visual field becomes contracted \u2014Ws like looking through a\u2010 tube. It becomes a progressively narrowing field until it gets down to a pinpoint and eventually disappears.\u201dA variety of methods\u2014often in combination\u2014are used to teach trainees form of communication, according to Jill Rosenfeld, a specialist.Those who have some degree of vision can be taught sign language. Those who are totally blind are usually taught a one hand manual alphabet popularly referred to as finger spelling. The finger positions are formed within the trainee's cupped hand. Another manual alphabet teaches how to trace blocked letters in the palm of the hand. It establishes a prescribed sequence and the number of strokes to be used. Braille and the use of a typewriter are also taught.\u201cBraille is very important,\u201d Miss Rosenfeld said. \u201cIt gives them the skill to read. They can't listen to the radio, watch television or even talk over the telephones. Can you imagine not being able to talk over the telephone?\u201dTasks that sighted persons learn by observation must be taught to the deafblind\u2014how to groom hair, put on make\u2010up, identify different denominations of money. Even recreational activities must be specially learned: The games of Monopoly and Scrabble, among others, are available in Braille.Cooking, cleaning and other household chores are taught in the model apartment setup, including a living room, dinette, kitchen and bathroom. Mere again, tactile methods are used. Braille strips indicate dials on appliances. The oven.hekt regulator is notched every 50 degrees.\u201cThe dial notches are set in accordance with a clock,\u201d said Elizabeth Janson, an instructor. \u201cSix would mean medium heat and nine, high. Most are able to cook something. Actually, there's a surprising lack of difficulty.\u201dWork conditions are simulated in the industrial\u2010arts area.\u201cWe have simple assembly operations and some that are more complex,\u201d said John Spainer, He was surrounded by machines including lathes, a milling machine, power hack saws, a band saw, buffing machines and foot\u2010 and handlever presses.As he spoke, a young man was operating a power hack saw, methodically cutting a 12\u2010foot strip of aluminum into two\u2022inch strips. \u201cHe's being groomed to return home to a job,\u201d Mr. Spainer said. \u201cBefore a trainee leaves, he'll be working in a situation that simulates an actual job, in which he'll be working a full day with one break in the morning and one break in the afternoon.\u201dPlacement specialists, he added, assist in finding .jobs. Trainees may become assemblers on production lines, work in sheltered workshops or find professional employment.Trainees are found and enrolled through a netwoek of eight regiorra offices throughout the country, as well as rehabilitation agencies, schools and programs for the disabled.A computerized list of the known deaf and blind is also kept, said Evan Marx, a public relations representative. \u201cSo far we have 5,000 names,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we think there are probably at least 10.000 we don't know about.\u201dThe Sands Point center, he said, accepts those most in need of help, while others are served at affiliated agencies in each area.Currently, 30 persons ranging in age from 18 to 60 are housed, although as many as 50 can be accommodated. Depending on their progress, some may stay as little as three months or \u201cas long as several years.As the handicapped reach for life as others know it, some may even achieve a state described in a poem, \u201cShared Beauty,\u201d written by Dr. Robert J. Smithdas, the center's director of community relations: \u201cI call it life and laugh with its delight, though life itself be out of sound and sight.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/14/archives/building-a-community-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Building a Community for the Deaf", "date": "1976-11-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 14, 1976,  Page 437Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

They are in a tough game against Anne Arundel College. The cheerleaders and pompom squad present a flurry of yellow and blue. The homecoming queen, crowned by a tiara, is enthroned before the bleachers.Hundreds of Gallaudet supporters are joining in the cheers or excitedly discussing the game. Yet, save for an occasional scream of joy or dismay, there is barely a sound in the stands. Instead, throughout the crowd there is a silent, rippling sea of hand movement.Gallaudet College is a liberal\u2010arts school of 1,202 students in Washington. Its campus, surrounding a broad green in the northeastern part of the city, is a sedate mixture of low, modern, red\u2010brick buildings and Victorian gingerbread towers. And every one of its 1,027 undergraduates is deaf.The only liberal\u2010arts college in the world for the deaf, Gallaudet emerged in its present form in 1864, when Congress empowered it to grant college degrees. In 1954, Congress reiterated its support of Gallaudet. This fiscal year, the school received $15.6 million, or 86 percent of Its total operating budget, from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.Gallaudet's 3,034 graduates, according to Edward C. Merrill Jr., president of the college, are regarded as the \u201celite\u201d by the 1.9 million Americans who are deaf. Last year, Gallaudet's student body came from 49 states and 24 foreign countries.The school's goals seem almost paradoxical: The college exists to provide a complete and familiar community for its deaf students, yet it also seeks to propel them, upon graduation, back into a world dominated by those who hear.Critics of Gallaudet have suggested that the best preparation for that world would be an education within it, not isolated from it. But Mr. Merrill defended Gallaudet's philosophy. \u201cIt's the hearing people who want to put the kids in \u2018normal\u2019 schools,\u201d he said. \u201cBut proximity isn't integration. Isolation is what happens if you leave the burden of communication to the deaf person in a hearing college.\u201dClaude Stout, the student\u2010government president, said the school had taught him \u201cto be more independent.\u201d At Gallaudet, Mr. Stout says, the students are not confined or isolated, as they might have been at hearing colleges, but lead \u201creally satisfactory\u201d social lives, on the campus and in town.Communication at Gallaudet is achieved by the \u201ctotal\u201d method, a simultaneous use of speech, finger spelling and the sign languages: Signed English, an exact manual translation of the spoken word, or American Sign (Ameslan), a language of its own, with a distinct and simpler vocabulary and grammar. Every faculty and staff member at the school must be able to use this \u201ctotal\u201d method.Gallaudet's education of the deaf extends to young children, through its Kendall Demonstration Elementary School and Model Secondary School. Both are on the Gallaudet campus.These schools are responsible not only for teaching the young through \u201ctotal communication\u201d but also tor developing experimental programs for possible application throughout the country.John S. Schuchman, dean of the college, said that \u201cthe saddest times at Gallaudet are the commencement receptions, when you can still see the gap between students and parents. The students don't want to go home\u2014they don't communicate with their families.\u201dProfessors say there is an inherent difficulty in teaching the deaf. Most of the students \u201cdo not even know the meaning of language,\u201d Mr. Merrill said. Some 80 percent of the undergraduates are \u201cprelingually\u201d deaf\u2014they were born deaf or lost their hearing before the age of 3.\u201cIn political science courses, for example English must be taught first before die class can go on,\u201d Mr. Merrill said. About 75 percent of the students attend the school for five years, the first year being a preparatory one to bring their language skills and comprehension to college level.It is difficult, however, to compensate completely for language deficiencies. Jayne Lytle, an instructor in audiology and speech, said that students \u201ctend not to watch television, because of the hearing problem and are not in the habit of reading newspapers, because of the vocabulary problem.\u201dClasses at Gallaudet are generally limited to 20 students, so that teachers can easily observe everyone's participation. Desks are arranged in semicircles so that each student can speak to the others in sign language. But teachers of the deaf face a unique problem: If a student is bored or \u201clost\u201d by the lesson, he has only to avert his eyes and all contact is severed.Nonetheless, evidence of the school's success is obvious in statistics on its latest graduates, 19 percent of whom were accepted at graduate schools. For the rest, 85 percent of those seeeking private or public employment have now found jobs.One of the school's most innovative projects, conversational foreignlanguage classes, was instituted at the request of students returning from Gallaudet's foreign\u2010study tours. Their learning is helped by the use of \u201ccues,\u201d manual signs made close to the face that clearly show what sounds are being articulated.The use of \u201ccues\u201d is an experimental one. Phonetic symbols and videotape are relied upon as educational aids. And the deaf students enjoy an advantage over their hearing counterparts, for the teacher can speak two languages simultaneously: rendering a foreign phrase on the lips while manually translating it into English.In building this unique collegiate community, Gallaudet has also strengthened the resolve of its members to commit themselves to a continuing fight against job discrimination and prejudice.\u201cWe are the silent minority,\u201d Mr. Stout said. \u201cThis is why I am thinking about law school. I want to see the deaf get more legal opportunities because I understand their problems. My parents didn't talk much to me, but now, I can talk to the deaf children.\u201dLisa Berke, who graduated last year and is now one of four deaf law students in the country, said that the deaf resented the power exercised by those who hear. \u201cWe have never been able to control our own lives,\u201d she said. Jack R. Gannon, a Gallaudet alumnus who now directs the school's public relations, put the issue emphatically: \u201cWhat's so good about being normal? What the hell is wrong with being deaf?\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1976/05/02/archives/center-for-deafblind-nearly-ready-on-li-center-for-deafblind-ready.html", "headline": "Center for \u2018Deaf\u2010Blind\u2019 Nearly Ready on L.I.", "date": "1976-05-02T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 2, 1976, Section R, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Y.\u2014The overhead lighting just inside the front door is brilliant. The floor in the gym slopes upward to meet the walls. Fans switch on automatically when doors open. And a fire would start alarms shrieking and lights flashing, and beds would vibrate to jolt occupants from slumber.These are some of the design departures that are helping people who, like Helen Keller, are both deaf and blind. They are incorporated in the $6.6 million federally funded National Center for Deaf\u2010Blind Youths and Adults, nearing completion here on the edge of the old Daniel Guggenheim estate.The three\u2010building compound is the first of its kind in this country and one of only three in the world. It will prepare people who cannot see or hear to cope with their handicaps so they can return to conventional environments.A national network of satellite offices seeks out deaf\u2010blind persons eligible for assistance at the center, which was conceived by Peter J. Salmon, founder of the Industrial Home for the Blind and director of the center.It is designed to rehabilitate 50 youths and adults throughout the country in stays of several months to several years. The costs are borne by the home states of the residents. The Industrial Home for the Blind operates the center and pays the staff salaries.Architecturally, the establishment is a serene study in brick, wood and amber\u2010toned glass. Most of the offices and classrooms are in one building and the residential quarters in another. The third building, with specialty teaching areas, has a commercial garage, laundry, greenhouse, chicken coop and a kennel. The residents will acquire craft and mechanical skills and learn how to care for animals. The kennel will quarter not seeing\u2010eye dogs but potential pets.According to Frederick M. Kruger, the center's director of research, many of the design details are likely to ease the problems of virtually all types of physically handicapped persons.Dr. Kruger, who invented some of the electronic devices used at the center, said that ramps and a safety chute for rapid exit in an emergency would probably prove practical in many two\u2010story or some multilevel buildings frequented by people confined to wheelchairs. And the nonglare, shadowless lighting would be welcomed everywhere by the aging and even by the fully sighted, he said.The architect, Leon Swinson of Wiedersum Associates in Valley Stream, used non\u2010reflective lighting fixtures to illuminate the network of paths linking the buildings as well as in the interiors of the buildings. Some have as much as 90 candlepower, or double the conventional intensity. Some of the legally blind who will be trained at the center have some capacity to see if the lighting is right.But most of the alarms or rehabilitation aids devised from scratch or adapted by Mr. Swinson in consultation with the staff of the center are restricted in their application to the handicapped who will be treated here.The deaf\u2010blind number 10,000 to 15,000 in the United States, Dr. F,:ruger said. They have no means of distinguishing day from night, they have no radio or TV and little access to magazines, newspapers and books. Most of these people lead lonely, isolated lives. At the center there are 18 deaf\u2010blind residents.Finding ways to communicate with the deaf\u2010blind and teaching them ways to communicate with others is the main purpose of many of the programs at the center. One of the simplest specialty devices is the fire alarm system, which both gongs and produces a brilliant flashing light. Although the principles are in use elsewhere, here the sound and the light are purposely more intense.More unusual is the vibrator, a lied unit that Mr. Swinson adapted from those relaxing vibrators that are hitched to beds in motel rooms. His unit, specially housed and wired is hooked to the compound's fire alarm system, In an emergency, the fire alarm sets off the vibrator alerting the sleeper. To supplement such devices, Dr. Kruger devised a wireless wrist vibrator that he hopes will be completed in the near future. It will alert the handicapped wherever they are.\u201cThe problem throughout was to work out ways to tell the residents that they were confronting a wall, a staircase, a door or whatever,\u201d Mr. Swinson explained. \u201cThat's why we placed carpeting at the top of the staircases. And we sloped the floor upwards in the gym near the walls to warn those running or playing. There's more involved here then safety \u2014 for that we padded the wall under the basket for basketball players. The designs are intended to sharpen the senses and telegraph an alert.\u201dAt present the residents are living off campus and traveling here daily while the dormitory is completed. They will move in next month. Their rooms will have fans that are activated by the opening of the door, so that those inside can be alerted by the moving air currents to the presence of another.People newly afflicted with their handicap must relearn familiar experiences. The Otis Elevator Company worked out a simple solution for calling elevators. The button calling the car is depressed, and the caller keeps his finger on the call button until it pops out, signalling the arrival of the car. The floor buttons operate in the same way.Most of the adults at the center have been exposed to conventional environments and can work in the shop and get along in the model apartments. But others have been shut away in institutions for the mentally retarded for most of their lives.\u201cThese are the most fantastic people,\u201d Mr. Swinson said. \u201cThe staff brings such warmth and love to their work that those who are more handicapped than they are are bound to respond.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/30/archives/rabbinical-student-speaks-with-eloquent-fingers-to-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Rabbinical Student Speaks With Eloquent Fingers to the Deaf", "date": "1976-04-30T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 30, 1976,  Page 33Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

She also conducts services (a role not restricted to certified rabbis in the Jewish tradition) and teaches at the society as well as at Tempie Beth Or of the \u2010.Deaf in Hollis, Queens.Utilizing an earlier vocation \u2014she has been involved in the rtheater and puppetry since hildhood \u2014 the 27\u2010year\u2010old Miss Gottlieb gestures and talks with deliberate pronunciation, her fingers working in sign language she has partly adapted or created, her aniMated face registering nuances.\u201cIt's somewhere between dance and speech,\u201d Miss Gottlieb said in an interview. \u201cSigning has to be like a haiku \u2014very short words, concrete images. It carries within it a kind of feeling, sort of a hidden poetry, I guess, that looks very simple on the surface but really is not.\u201dAlthough there are snore than a dozen Jewish associations for the deaf in the country that occasionally hold services, at least during the High Holy Days, there are only two other synagogues for the deaf, in Skokie, Ill., and Van Nuys, Calif., according to the society, a nonsectarian organization supported chiefly by the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York.Miss Gottlieb's work is valued by those familiar with it.\u201cI consider it .of stupendous importance,\u201d said Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, executive Vice president of the Rabbinical Assembly, adding that the Jewish community somehow had not generally provided for the religious needs of the handicapped other than the blind.Although Rabbi Kelman belongs to the Conservative branch of Judaism, which does not recognize women as rabbis, he has told Miss Gottlieb he will join several other rabbis in certifying her for the rabbinate if she satisfactorily completes courses at the Jewish Theological Seminary.Miss Gottlieb expects that to happen in a year oe a year and a half.A graduate of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, she began working with the deaf three years ago after a fellow rabbi\u2019 meal student\u2014her predecessor at Beth Or\u2014took her to a service here. She learned sign language chiefly from a deaf; woman in the congregation, who helped her avoid the pitfalls of a beginner.For example, Miss Gottlieb said, someone inexperienced try to convey, the opening words of the Bible; \u201cIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\u201d might sign it literally.For the word \u201cin,\u201d she said, demonstrating, \u201cyou would insert one hand inside the other, as if you were trying to get, your hand in a narrow cookie jar, only without the wiggles.\u201d\"Then, you would make the sign for \u2018beginning\u2019 or \u2018start,\u2019 \u201d she continued, inserting an index finger between the first and second fingers of her other hand, \u201cas though you were turning the ignition key in a car.\u201d\u201cBut that makes no sense,\u201d she added, raising her eyebrows quizzically \u201d \u2018In\u2019 refers to space, not time, so you have \u2018inside a start.\u2019 For \u2018God\u2019 you'd point up with your open hand like this and then come down for \u2018make.\u2019 \u201cShe brought the fist atop the other and rubbed them together \u201clike you were stirring a caldron.\u201dUnfortunately, she observed, that seems to imply that God had'. to work at it. A better Algn for \u201cmade,\u201d .which she devised,\u2010, involves flinging both hands open, palms up, \u201cso it doesn't look like magic.\u201dApproaching a complex or abstract notion requires inventiveness. For example, at recent Seders, she wished to explain that, on one level, Passover could be thought of is \"a personal passing over, leaving the routine way of perceiving yourself in the world.\"She began by talking about noticing things for the first time and then asked those at the table to turn and. fate someone they knew and look for something they had never observed before\u2010the color of the person's eyes, for example.Her congregations, whose education and experience in signing or lip\u2010reading varies a great deal, are not largely synagogue\u2010goers, and Miss Gottlieb says she is more interested in giving meaning to a ceremony than \u201claying tradition on someone's head.\u201d\u201cWhether Passover really haprpened or not, it has been relived so many. _times, it's \u2010true,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a vehicle for relating something which is true about life.\u201dShe always seeks the participation of the congregation.At the workshop in which the Women: chanted a song, they were enacting what Miss Gottlieb described as an ancient Hebrew cerernony once performed by women to welcome the new moon \u2018as a sign of forever beginning.\" Afterwards, some of the . participants described how it felt the first time they gave birth.Most people she meets outside her field are as mystified. by her specialty as they are by the nation of a woman rabbi, Miss Gottlieb said. A number of times, she recalled, someone learning she served deaf people has looked blankly\u2019 and asked, \u201cOh, do you know Braille?\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/09/archives/new-wing-of-junior-high-for-the-deaf-dedicated.html", "headline": "New Wing of Junior High for the Deaf Dedicated", "date": "1976-04-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 9, 1976,  Page 41Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

School bells have been replaced with lights, and the decor is predominantly bright yellow and orange.The architects for the combined project were the firms of Carl Puchall and Associates and Seymour Jarmul & Bernard Brizee.For the city\u2014whose fiscal difficulties resulted in 20 teachers being cut from the budget of the School for the Deaf, according to Helen A. Reilly, the principal\u2014the $4 million worth of improvement to the school was made possible by combining the new wing with a 168\u2010unit middle\u2010income apartment tower.Sol A. Liebman, executive director of the Educational Construction Fund, an independent public\u2010benefit corporation responsible for developing the combination project, explained that the money for construction was borrowed against the future income from the nonschool portion of the building. Within the next year, 13 public school buildings financed in the same way will have been competed, he added.During the ceremonies in the rain students pressed their noses to upstairs windows to look down on the playground, where 150 people heard speeches. One message appeared to be repeated by every speaker, including Mrs. Reilly.\u201cI see radiation all around me,\u201d she said, as a teacher translated her words into sign language. \u201cThe sun is really shining.

It creates a world where birds do not sing, laughter is not heard and music does not play.It is the world of the totally deaf and those with impaired hearing, those who must cope with life in a different way and on different terms.At the Gatehouse Nursery, on the Douglass College campus, that separate, silent world is invaded by a small army of college students majoring in speech therapy. They are led by Mrs. Sadie Julius, a dedicated and gifted nursery\u2010school teacher, in an ongoing project that doesn't even take time out for a summer vacation.For the preschool hard\u2010ofhearing and deaf children presently enrolled, the Gatehouse is an opportunity to gain verbal skills. For the college students, it is a laboratory for practical application of classroom theories in audiology, oral rehabilitation, linguistic behavoir and lip reading.No Sign LanguageNo finger spelling or sign language is taught at the Gatehouse, all in the hope that the very young will learn to depend on their vocal cords, rather than their hands, to communicate.According to Dr. Dorothy Durand, director of the Rutgers Speech and Hearing Center, no form of communication is discouraged. Instead, the children are bombarded with a variety of stimuli to promote language response.\u201cWe aim high,\u201d Mrs. Julius said. \u201cThe younger the children start, the better chance they have at mastering language. If a child doesn't return language to us, and a special school for the deaf is necessary, he can learn finger spelling easily enough.\u201dNo artificial sound system is used at the Gatehouse in order to increase the volume of the teachers\u2019 voices. Hearing aids worn by the children are used to protect residual hearing, or to help improve sound reception in those instances where partial hearing is present.The program is open to preschool children in Central Jersey. In some communities, local Boards of Education have recognized the benefit of the nursery as a means of making a normal education possible through early training. These boards provide transportation to the Gatehouse, even though state law does not require their interest in children before the age of 5.Program Began in 1964The Gatehouse project was instituted in 1964. A group of mothers, whiling away the hours in the waiting rooms at the Rutgers Speech and Hearing Center as their children attended therapy sessions, mused on the possibility of a preschool nursery geared to the needs of their youngsters. In most cases, the deafness stemmed from the rubella epidemic of the late nineteen\u2010fifties and early sixties.The mothers approached Dr. Durand and with the blessing of Margery Foster, former Dean of Douglass, the tiny gatehouse was provided. It was once the gardener's cottage of the Neilson estate, a city landmark that is now part of the college complexDr. Durand then recruited Mrs. Julius to teach both the children and the co\u2010eds.The parents also founded the Central Jersey Association of the Deaf and Hearing Handicapped. Its first task was to raise funds for the Gatehouse, but the program is now financed by Rutgers. There is no tuition charge for the two winter sessions, and only a minimal fee for the summer program.The parents\u2019 organization continues \u00b6D provide toys, playground e'suipment and some furnishings.Because of the success of the hearing project, the Speech and Hearing Center this year introduced an experimental preschool program for children with cleft palates.\u201cThrough research, we find that children who undergo palatal surgery do not develop language at the appropriate times,\u201d Dr. Durand said. \u201cWe thought, why not provide a nursery where we can monitor the child's progress so that we can intervene at an early time, it we see the need. The program has shown us that the need for early help is obvious.\u201dChildren in the cleft\u2010palate program also are drawn from the Central Jersey area, and are referred to the Gatehouse by their physicians. Like the project for the deaf, there are no tuition fees."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/31/archives/retarded-getting-a-sign-language-technique-is-being-devised-at.html", "headline": "RETARDED GETTING A SIGN LANGUAGE", "date": "1975-08-31T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 31, 1975,  Page 37Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Like its companion institution in Mansfield, the school here has directed its efforts from its beginnings 35 years ago to finding new ways of making its residents more at ease in society and less dependent on it if possible.Of the first 10 persons admitted at Southbury on Oct. 15, 1940, one was back in the community in December and more followed with reasonable frequency.Those were relatively easy cases: all were young men and all were borderline cases or, at worst, mildly retarded.Since then, the problem has grown and the nature of it changed. There are now 49,000 retarded persons in Connecticut, although not all of them are aware of it, and not all are in serious need of institutional care or supervision, according to the State Department of Mental Retardation.Capacity of 1,600Although the Southbury school includes 42 brick cottages spread over a sprawling campus it has room to house not many more than 1,600 comfortably. Mansfield, which is spread a bit less extensively, tries to keep its resident population under 1,200.Through 11 regional centers, 28 group homes, 48 foster homes and 65 boarding homes, the state cares for nearly 2,000 more retarded persons close to their own communities, close to hospitals, schools and social agencies that use he of help.Nearly 700 other retarded persons are cared for in the regional centers during the day. Still more go to the centers for specific help, whether counseling or job placement.But while the state has successfully de\u2010institutionalized many borderline or mildly retarded cases, the number of severely retarded and profoundly retarded persons is increasing.Even the percentage of desperate cases is climbing, as advances in medicine keep more of them alive who almost certainly would have died in other times.Personal CareAlthough he has 1,100 employes and many volunteer workers looking after the residents in the Southbury school, Frank R. Giliberty, the superintendent, seeks to personalize the care even more by selffeeding programs, dressing programs, toilet training, physiotherapy and intensive counseling. The Gestural Language Program is one of the newest efforts.In some cases the rudimentary communication facilitated by the program has led to the discovery that a person was not as retarded as had been believed.\u201cHere's a boy we thought was profoundly retarded,\u201d said Michael J. Belmont, director of education and training at Southbury. He was speaking of Eric Uihlein, a dark\u2010haired young man who was brought to Southbury 10 years ago\u2014anguished, battered, unable to speak, bent apparently only on twisting in his wheelchair and smashing his limp, imperfect fists into his face.\u201cWe used to tie him to his chair,\u201d Mr. Belmont said. \u201cThere was no doubt in my mind: He would always have to be confined.\u201dBut a large part of Eric's troubled behavior lay not in neurological impediments, but in his frustration. It soon became clear to staff members at Southbury that he comprehended much of what was going on around him. Before long, the simple informal gestures used around Eric were not enough for him, and the idea of a language of gestures evolved.Signs ExchangedSome signs were borrowed from the deaf, but some were beyond the capabilities of those who function at a very low mental level, or who have trouble moving or flexing their hands.The gestural language was picked by the Mansfield Training School, where there had already been a year of experimentation with gestures for people at a higher level of intelligence. Signs were exchanged with institutions in Texas, California and Wisconsin, which took to the idea of a standardized language.Teachers and counselors from around Connecticut, and many of the parents of the people in the Southbury school, have learned the language, and attend monthly meetings to keep up with it and discuss its inadequacies. Of 1.610 residents at the Southbury School, 35 are in full\u2010time gestural\u2010language classes."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/08/archives/deaf-of-30-nations-to-fight-diseases-that-harm-hearing.html", "headline": "Deaf of 30 Nations To Fight Diseases That Harm Hearing", "date": "1975-08-08T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 8, 1975,  Page 23Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The meeting, held every four years, brought together 2,000 deaf people and the professionals serving the 650,000 people with hearing impairments in this country and the 13.5 million around the world. This is the first meeting of the federation in the United States.Using the theme, \u201cfull citizenship for all deaf people,\u201d the commissions within the federation presented research and scientific material that could help deaf people receive better education and better job training.The federation's panel on vocational rehabilitation, for instance, recommended that all training programs for the deaf include instruction on how to use leisure time.The panel studying communication recommended that each country find ways to communicate televised emergency announcement to deaf citizens\u2014such as placing captions on public service information for those with hearing impairments to read.The recommendations still have to be approved by the governing body of the federation, which is affiliated with the International Labor Organization, the World Health, Organization and the, United.

The world premiere of \u201cSzopka,\u201d a mummers' play based on the story of Christ as depicted in Polish legends handed down through the centuries.Amalgamation of Cultures\u201cSzopka\u201d is a literary term for Polish drama in which villagers on various holidays took to the streets in costume to perform incidents in the life of Christ according to their own interpretations. In this work by Mr. Guszczak, the director has set out to place on stage an amalgamation of all aspects of Polish culture, from music to architecture.Czerwinski, artistic director of the Slavic Cultural Center and professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, L.L., explained that \u201cSzopka\u201d epitomized Mr. Guszczak's efforts and that it, like ?? the group's works, was far removed from the Marcel Marceau concept of pantomime.Mr: Czerwinsid, who recently returned from a year of educational and cultural activities in Poland and is a spokesman for the Olsztyn Pantomime, said that the company presented works that feature all theatrical elements \u2014 scenery, costumes, story line, spectacle and music.What is more, Mr. Czerwinski said, the Olsztyn Pantomime has been inspired by the commedia dell'arte work of Jean\u2010Louis Barrault, as represented by such mime characters as Pierrot, Pierrette and Harlequin.The \u2018Silent People\u2019\u201cBut with the Olsztyn troupe,\u201d Mr. Czerwinski said, \u201cMr. Guszczak has reel Pierrots and Pierrettes, real silent people,\u201d and he is striving to go beyond what already has been done by other pantontimists.For Mr. Guszezak, Mr. Czerwinsid said, this means perfecting the use of rhythms by those who cannot hear them and adding ethnic influence.The Olsztyn Pantomime itself was formed in 1957. Those in the troupe are, by vocation, workers. But they were seeking a means of artistic expression by forming a theater. So they approached the House of Culture, a countylike institution, in their region, in northern Poland for support. They are governmentally subsidized and their factories give them time off to pursue their art.Initially, the group's activities were regarded as therapeutic. But as the troupe has developed, winning prizes at international competitions (mime is a relatively well\u2010supported art in Europe), it has sought to shed the stigma of being a company of the handicapped.The Olsztyn Pantomime ends its four\u2010day performance tomorrow at the Kennedy Center in Washington under the sponsorship of the American Medical Association as part of its congress on deaf mutes. The remainder of its visit is being sponsored by the Slavic Cultural Center.It will appear next Wednesday and Thursday at Southampton College: on Friday at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Theater; next Saturday and Sunday at Hofstra University and Aug. 12 to 20 at J\u00f3zef Szajna Theater of the Slavic Cultural Center, 709 Main Street, Port Jefferson.

She has had a 90 per cent hearing loss since birth, and can only hear such things as automobile horns, sirens or the barking of dogs.Adrienne known as Tiny because she was a two\u2010pound premature baby, and because she is still not as tall as others her age, attends the St. Joseph's School for the Deaf in the Bronx. She is learning to read lips and can make herself understood vocally.How does she compare with other deaf skaters? Well she has been invited to compete in the World Games for the Deaf at Lake Placid, N.Y., Feb. 2\u20138 against three of the best deaf skaters in the country. She is the youngest of the four. The others are a 16\u2010year\u2010old boy and two 15\u2010year\u2010old girls.\u201cI think this is the eighth winter Games for the deaf, but they've never had figure skating before,\u201d said Mrs. America. \u201cAt first they told me the skating might be a demonstration, but later they said it would he a competition, so I don't know now.\u201d\u201cI don't know how she compares with other deaf skaters her age, because she is the only deaf pupil I've ever had,\u201d said Fred Rowan, the pro at Riverdale Rink in the Bronx, where Tiny has taken her skating lessons the last two years. \u201cBut among normal skaters her own age she does very well. Her main problem is memorization, but I have a bad memory myself.\u201dWhat makes memorization a critical problem for Adrienne is that she does not hear the music, so Rowan has to write down the movements and the beats and get her to memorize them so no one can tell she is not skating to the music.It's expensive, which is another reason most blacks can't afford to get involved. Good skates, which Adrienne needs at least once a year because she's growing, cost $60 and up. Lessons cost $9 per half\u2010hour. Weekend rink time is over $200 for the Octoberthrough\u2010April season.Then there are items such as clothing and trips to distant places such as Kentucky, where Tiny won a second place last year in competition with youngsters who had no hearing impairment."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/02/archives/4-deaf-students-a-re-first-to-get-masters-in-theater-education.html", "headline": "4 Deaf Students Are First to Get Master's in Theater Education", "date": "1974-06-02T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 2, 1974,  Page 61Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The plan was a cooperative venture of the college and the National Theater Institute of the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theater Center in nearby Waterford.Those receiving the degrees were Mary Beth Miller of Louisville, Ky.; Dorothy Miles, 40 years old, of Northridge, Calif.; Fanny Wen Tau Yeh, 25, of Washington, D. C., and Arthur Tomlinson, 25, of Chicago.All are looking forward to teaching or directing jobs.Each student had to complete a project in student teaching and up to 30 more hours of courses ranging from puppetry to special problems in deaf theater.The creator of the program is Dr. David Hays, director of the National Theater of the Deaf, another venture of the O'Neill Theater Center. Mr. Hays, a vice president of the O'Neill Theater, has worked extensively in theater programs for the deaf.The program, now accredited by the graduate\u2010studies office at Connecticut College, is assured of funds for the next two years from H. E. W.Earlier, the graduation exercises were interrupted by a stresker in a red cap and gown who appeared onstage just as Dr., Charles E. Shun, president of the college, was about to begin the ceremony.The young man, wearing a Groucho Marx mask, threw open his robe to reveal bright pink undershorts. He then pulled the shorts to his knees and duck\u2010waddled to a door. Later, Dr. Shain was handed a letter in which the unidentified student apologized, and he read it to the audience."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/05/archives/a-deaf-couple-is-content-with-watchmakers-work.html", "headline": "A Deaf Couple Is Content With Watch\u2010Makers\u2019 Work", "date": "1974-05-05T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 5, 1974,  Page 157Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

So she ascribes it to naivete.But her friends think differently. As a tribute to her 35 years as executive director of what is now the New york Society for the Deaf, they have named the recently completed 137\u2010unit apartment tower at 612 East 13th Street \u201cTanya Towers.\u201dShe, retired from the society An 1968\u2014though she stays active as consultant\u2010\u2010and her visits to Tanya Towers, if the one a few days ago is any measure, excite an outpouring of warmth and a flurry of fingers.\u201cThe deaf are lovable people,\u201d Mrs. Nash said. They should not be institutionalized, she said, and they should not be segregated from hearing people, whose friendship they appreciate.These ideas are fulfilled in Tanya Towers. The building is two\u2010thirds occupied so far. All the tenants are elderly, but only half are deaf and mute. One floor of apartments has been leased by United Cerebral Palsy of New York City, which has a facility nearby.The New York Society for the Deaf is nearby also, at 344 East 14th Street. But the people it serves areacattered throughout the city and many are of moderate means.When crime became a greater public concern, Mrs. Nash felt that it was necessary to build a housing facility\u2010for the elderly, deaf near the agency's offices.\u201cHearing people can go to the friend around the corner, the neighbor next door, but the deaf often have no one to visit and are terribly isolated socially,\u201d Mrs. Nash said.The society's board agreed, rind at the numerous public hearings that preceded final approval of Mitchell\u2010Lama financing Mrs. Nash acted as interpreter for the deaf. She said that she never saw public officials so happy to give away money.The $5.5\u2010million project received 100 per cent mortgage financing, which means that the sponsor, the society, needed to put in none of its own funds. A 50\u2010year mortgage at one per cent interest assured a moderate level of rents.The architecture, like the financing, is somewhat special. There is a visual rather than an audio announcement system, for example. When a visitor \u201crings, the bell\u201d in the lobby, a green lfight flashes in the apartment. A red\u2010light flash is afire warning.Closed\u2010circuit television in the apartments monitors the front entrance. Wide doors permit wheelchairs to pass through. A special pay telephone in the lobby will be equipped with a teletypewriter for communication with others with similar equipment.The architectural firm of Schuman, Lichtenstein and Claman designed the building.The New York Society for the Deaf was founded in 1911 as the Society for the Welfare of the Jewish Deaf. In 1929 Rabbi A. Felix Nash became the director. When he died in 1932 his widow succeeded him. In 1951 the society changed its name to the Jewish Society for the Deaf, and 15 years, later it assumed its present name.\u201cWe have really been nonsectarian all along and on high Jewish holidays many of the Christian deaf would come back to see their old friends,\u201d Mrs. Nash said.There are about 18,000 to 20,000 so\u2010called profoundly deaf people\u2014those who were born without hearing\u2010in the metropolitan area and about seven or eight times that. many with hearing defects. The society, which works with the profoundly deaf, is involved in job placement areas as printing, keypunch operation, typing, packaging, warehousing and computers.Joseph G. Blum, an attorney who is chairman of the society, said that occupational discrimination had kept most of the profoundly deaf in lower economic brackets. Many of them still cannot meet the rent levels for Tanya Towers, he said, explaining why it was not yet fully occupied. But vacancy decontrol and rising rents under the city's maximum base rent program will tend to make projects like Tanya Towers more attractive to them, he suggested.Studio apartments in the building rent for $152 a month and one\u2010bedroom units rent for $192. Single residents must have an annual income below $9,000 married residents below $10,000. The society itself or Allison Management Company at 175\u201020 Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, 11432, takes applications.This \u201cmini\u2010mall\u201d in the White Plains Central Renewal District was designed to take advantage of a sloping site. The 170,000 square feet of retail space are on two levels, with parking. for 137 cars at grade level and a ramp to the 230 parking spaces on the roof. There are 35 stores, two bank branches, a supermarket and two restaurants. The center was developed by M&D Furtsch Company fof White. Plains and Benerofe Associates of Port Chester.

She told her audience here that intensive auditory train ing could develop natural speech in children with very little residual hearing.One in Each EarWhen children, even infants, are fitted early enough with binaural hearing aids, she said, they can develop aural communication adequate to permit them to go to school with their \u201chearing peers\u201d and to fit comfortably into a hearing world.\u201cLess than 5 per cent of hearing\u2010impaired children are totally deaf,\u201d Mrs. Beebe said. It is that remnant of hearing that she and similar therapists seek to develop. There are about 100 practitioners in the country, and major centers in Colorado and Tennessee, where this method is stressed over others.Communication by the use of lip\u2010reading, hearing aids and sign language is the usual method of teaching the deaf in day and residential schools.The Bell Association would like to see that change. There are about 15 million adults and three million children with some degree of hearing loss in the country today, and about 350,000 are identified as deaf. The Bell Association believes that many children are unnecessarily written off as deaf because they have never been fitted with hearing aids.Answering SkepticsBecause the association seeks to enroll deaf children in regular school programs, it is interested in exploring and promoting auditory methods of teaching the deaf. The organization's efforts are sometimes met with doubt, but \u201cyou have to see the video tapes and talk to students and graduates to see that these methods work,\u201d said the Bell association's executive director, George W. Fellendorf, who was moderator of the conference.Mrs. Beebe and her staff explained that the essential difference betwen the Beebe Unisensory and the usual auditory approach is that children are deprived of all visual clues, even lip reading. Even as infants they are forced to use whatever hearing they have, no matter how small.\u201cBy the elimination of lipreading from the language instruction of very young children, they are forced to depend upon and develop confidence in what they hear,\u201d Mrs. Beebe said. \u201cThe unisensory program teaches children to listen, and because they can hear, they learn to speak.\u201dRhythm and PitchThe speech that results has a natural rhythm and pitch\u2014a normal voice quality. \u201cIt doesn't sound like dogs barking, as so much of the speech of the deaf does,\u201d said Mrs. Beebe.This natural modulation is developed by having the child wear the two hearing aids all the time and bathing in sound. A program of intensive listening training is followed by the parents with the therapist as guide.In addition, the child learns how to move his jaws and lips, to \u201cchew\u201d while emitting sound, The chewing method is used by speech teachers to establish pitch in persons with normal hearing; it is also used for teaching normal speech \u201cmelody\u201d to the hearing\u2010impaired."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/aids-to-help-deaf-blind-people-shown-few-have-both-handicaps.html", "headline": "Aids to Help Deaf\u2010Blind People Shown", "date": "1973-12-02T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 2, 1973,  Page 60Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

I., Dec. 1\u2014A two\u2010day conference aimed at developing communication aids for people with the dual handicaps of deafness and blindness was held here this week for educators and scientists.The conference was held at the National Center for Deaf\u2010Blind Youths and Adults, a government \u2010 financed facility operated by the Industrial Home for the Blind, which provides rehabilitation and vocational training for the dual\u2010handicapped.Dr. Frederick M. Kruger, the center's research director, said:\u201cWhat we are trying to do here is develop special devices for the person who has neither sight nor vision. Everything must be done through touch or smell.\u201dThose who attended the conference, on Thursday and Friday, saw two special electronic communications aids designed by the research staff of the center.Impulses ConvertedOne of these was Telebraille, which allows the deaf\u2010blind person to communicate over the telephone by Braille. The telephone is placed on a device that transmits the Braille characters. At the receiving end, a special cell converts the electrical impulses into mechanical form that can be \u201cread\u201d by the recipient's fingers.A second special device, still in its development stage, is the Wrist\u2010Com, a miniaturized wireless signaling device for paging blind\u2010deaf persons.The Wrist\u2010Corn will be worn as a large bracelet and will incorporate the ability to receive diverse messages through various vibration combinations, which will mean different things to the person wearing the receiver. For example, one signal could be used to indicate the ringing of a door\u2010bell, while another would in dicate a telephone ringing.About 35 scientists, educators and technologists from goveminent agencies and private companies attended the conference. Among them were representatives from Bell Telephone Laboratories, the Massachuselts Institute of Technology, the National Academy of Sciences and International Business Machines, Inc.Few Have Both HandicapsDr. Kruger explained that few private corporations had embarked on the development and manufacture of aids for the deaf\u2010blind because the number of people with both handicaps is so small. The center here estimates that there are about 10,000 deaf\u2010blind people in the United States.By bringing together scientists and educators on a voluntary basis, the center hopes to get companies and research institutions interested in developing the special communications aids needed.Dr. Kruger said that if a device such as the Telebraille was produced commercially it would sell for over $5,000. If it could be produced by independent research organizations on a voluntary or at\u2010cost basis, it could be made available for considerably less.On Thursday the conference participants attended a work shop designed to acquaint them with the special needs of the deaf blind. Some of the participants were blindfolded, handed a long white cane, and led around the streets outside the center. Others were shown how to make a bed or thread a needle without the use of their vision.\u201cIf scientists and technologists can experience sightlessness or deafness even momentarily,\u201d Dr. Kruger said, \u201cthey can better understand what electronic devices can and cannot do.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/joseph-r-collins-sr-dies-officer-in-society-for-deaf.html", "headline": "Joseph R.

Nov. 30 \u2014Thousands of persons who are deaf, or whose hearing is partially impaired, will he aided by a system of captioning of television pictures developed by WGBH\u2010TV, a Boston educational station.Starting Dec. 3. WGBH \u2014and 10 other educational stations in the Northeast\u2014will broadcast a videotape of the A.B.C. evening news with subtitles similar to those used in foreign films transposed on the screen. The videotape will be shown at 11 P.M. five hours after its regular broadcast.In the intervening time, a five\u2010man staff in WGBH's studios will type a transcript of the program, and edit it to eliminate idioms that might be unfamiliar to a deaf person. The edited version will then be fed into a computer, which will make a tape creating the captions on the screen.The captions, with large characters and maximum screen time, have been designed to be read easily and to facilitate Ole understa offing of dialogue. The subtitles will be positioned on the screen to indicate the speaker. In addition, conversations will be edited to make, them shorter and clearer.The technique was developed by the Boston station under a $106,000 demonstration contract from the United States Office of Education. WGBH, under a previous grant, has been experimenting with programing for the deaf for they last two years.In order to broadcast the news program, permission was required not only from the American Broadcasting Company, but also from each of its network affiliates in the areas chosen for the special show.At a news conference here, officials of the Public Broadcasting Service announced that an experimental program would be launched in January to test a decoding device that can he attached to television sets, enabling them to translate TV waves into subtitles. This technique, called \u201cclosed captioning.\u201d will be tested in six cities."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/30/archives/verstehen-sie-zeichensprache-sign-language.html", "headline": "Verstehen Sie Zeichensprache (Sign Language)?", "date": "1973-09-30T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from September 30, 1973,  Page 588Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

According to the \u201coralists,\u201d all deaf children can learn to lip read and to speak and consequently require a minimum of sign language.The \u201ctotal communicators\u201d dispute this contention. They maintain that lip readers miss much of what a speaker intends to impart. With gestures, fingerspelling, formal sign language and speech all combined, they say, a deaf youngster will gain a far better education.Two of the parents interviewed, Mrs. Pat O'Hara and Miss Rosemarie Jaenike, said that only one of the five semiprivate schools for the deaf in New York City used the total communication method.As a result, they pointed out, the majority of deaf children graduate after attending school since the age of 2 or 3 with little more than a fifth or sixth grade reading level.The parents met at St. Ann's Church for the Deaf, a mission of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, at 426 West End Avenue between 80th and 81st Streets.According to Mrs. O'Hara, about 1,500 students attend the five schools for the deaf.

Another boy greets a classmate with an ear\u2010to\u2010ear smile. He wants her to know that this is his birthday.In a classroom here one recent morning, the two children were communicating without spoken words. The first, boy gestured with his hand to show that he had picked up the toad and put it in the jar. The second held up nine fingers.They are among the 134 children between 4 and 14 who are enrolled in the Hackensack Program for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired.The opening of additional classroom space recently has made it possible to admit about 40 more children this school year than last. It also allowed the continued enrollment of preschool chil dren.Housed in 19 classrooms in schools and churches here and in East Rutherford, the program, administered by the Hackensack Board of Edu cation, is in its fifth year of providing special educa tion for deaf children from Bergen, Hudson, and Passaic Counties.Most of the, pupils have been deaf from birth.The state pays half of the $4,000 tuition and three\u2010 fourths of the transportation costs of the pupils. The home towns of the children pay the balance.Frances Phillips, the pro gram coordinator, works with a staff of 19 teachers, a speech therapist, nine teachers' aides, and a trip bus driver.\u201cOur goal is to teach these children to communi cate and to help them inter act with hearing children,\u201d she said.Recent technical advances in hearing equipment help even children with profound hearing loss to make the best possible use of the little hear ing they have.To compensate for the dif ficulty in spoken communi cation, the teachers put great emphasis on visual means. All the classrooms abound in charts, posters, signs, labels, display boards, page\u2010projec tors and learning devices that develop visual perception and form associations be tween printed words and meaning.The children seem highly motivated to learn. Teachers and pupils rely heavily on gestures. By pointing and by making other motions, they indicate direction, people, ob jects, instructions, and con cepts like past tense, future tense, babyish, good and absent.Whenever possible, the deaf children eat lunch with children who, hear normally, and participate with them in some activities such as as sembly programs, physical education and home eco nomics."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/30/archives/sign-language-offers-clues-to-primeval-gift-of-gab.html", "headline": "Sign Language Offers Clues to Primeval Gift of Gab", "date": "1972-09-30T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from September 30, 1972,  Page 33Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

To Dr. Ursula Bellugi, how ever, it is full of poetry, wit, irony and\u2014most important to her as a linguist\u2014some tantalizing clues to the fun damental nature of all lan guages and how they are ac quired by children.The clues are imbedded in the complex structure of sign, a natural language that has a grammar and folk art of its own but that is un like most forms of human communication because it employs movement and sight rather than speech and hear ing.Many linguists believe that humans have an innate bi logical capacity for language since children show evidence of having mastered most of the underlying rules of lan guage at a remarkably early age without having been taught. But little research has been done to separate out those particular aspects of language that reflect the me dium of communications from those that are inborn.In a pioneering study, Dr. Bellugi has posited the theory that by examining a language in another \u201cmodality,\u201d in which speech and hearing are absent, one should get some idea which traits of language are truly universal and which are peculiar to spoken lan guage.The study is still very rudi mentary, but she has some indications that while deaf children seem to display much the same skill as hear ing children in acquiring lan guage, the basic structural characteristics of sign may be quite different from those of speech. It this is borne out, then linguists may have to rethink some assumptions about the universality of lan guage structure.\u201cIt's rather important to get a fresh look at language with out all the evolution behind it \u2014this gives us another way to get at the biological basis of language,\u201d she said in an interview at her studio here at the Salk Institute for Bio logical Studies.With Deaf SubjectsAt Salk, a striking con crete monument above the Pacific Ocean near San Diego, she is painstakingly analyzing American Sign Lan guage with the help of video recorders and many deaf subjects, including congeni tally deaf youngsters with flailingly pudgy fingers who are learning sign from the deaf parents much the way hearing children slowly learn to speak by imitating their parents.Contrary to popular belief, sign is not a mere approxi mation of English\u2014and this is what makes it so valuable to the Salk study. It has a rich vocabulary, puns, poems and even regional \u201caccents.\u201d American Sign\u2014the most common system used in the United States\u2014is so differ ent from English that deaf children must learn to read and write English like a for eign language.Before tackling her main task of studying sign acqui sition among children, Dr. Bellugi has been attempting to explore and describe the basic structure of sign. To do this she has constructed many ingenious tests to de termine\u2014in linguistic terms \u2014how adult signers under stand, perceive, memorize, process and use their lan guage.Into a Silent WorldThis has carried her into a wondrous silent new world in which word order, inflec tions and grammatical end ings, the essential glue that lends coherence to speech, disappear in favor of other mechanisms more appropri ate to gesture.\u201cThe visual system was not set up to handle things that change very very rap idly,\u201d Dr. Bellugi said, \u201cso there is a tremendous re ordering \u2014 things get ex pressed in very different ways.\u201dAccordingly, she has found that sign is striking in its economy. Because it takes much longer to sign than to speak, the language has ap parently involved many short cuts, ridding itself of articles, copulas and other nonessen tials. For example, the phrase \u201cI look at you,\u201d is formed by a single quick sign made with the fingers in a \u201cV\u201d sign and pointed toward the oth er person.Dr. Bellugi has devised a method by which she de scribes each sign in terms of three \u201cparameters\u201d: hand configuration, location and movement. Hand shape is the main factor in sign, but lo cation and movement are used to change meaning and tense. Thus verbs in the fu ture tense are usually made by a forward movement and past in the opposite direc tion.Similarly, related words like \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d are the same except for their position, \u201cFather\u201d is made by spreading the fingers out and touching the forehead with the thumb; for \u201cmother\u201d the thumb touches the chin.This descriptive framework has played an important role in experiments at Salk on how the deaf remember. Psy chologists have long associ ated short\u2010term memory with an ability to retain an auditory impression of words and numbers. So how do the deaf remember?Given a series of unrelat ed words to repeat, hearing persons often make errors by confusing sound\u2010alike words, such as \u201cbother\u201d and \u201cfa ther.\u201d But when repeating signs, the deaf tend to make entirely different errors, con fusing signs of similar con figuration, movement or lo cation. \u201cCandy,\u201d signed with the index finger near the chin and a twist of the wrist, is often confused with \u201cjeal ous,\u201d the same except that the middle finger is used.They make the same er rors even when asked to write down the series, sug gesting that memory is en tirely visual in the deaf.Another means of sensing the texture of a language is to study its humor and word play, and these abound in sign. It is almost impossible to convey to a nonsigner, but one example of a spoonerism occurred when someone was trying to say, \u201cUrsula showed me a funny thing.\u201d She acci dentally combined the sign for \u201cUrsula,\u201d made with a \u201cU\u201d near the mouth, and \u201cfunny,\u201d made near the top of the nose with a downward motion. It came out as a \u201cU\u201d on the side of the nose.Dr. Bellugi has also been studying such aspects of sign as paraphrase, lexical rich ness, timing and even its song and poetry. She believes she has detected the analogues of such sophisticated word play as alliteration, assonance and rhyme.How can a person deaf from birth create a \u201csong\u201d? This \u201clove song,\u201d written in sign by a boy about his first girlfriend, was performed by his older sister. In translation it went like this in part: Know what?She has blonde hair, Like the sun shining down on me.And has blue eyes, Like the skies above.While signing the song the girl's body swayed with an almost musical rhythm. The number of beats per line had a distinctly poetic meter and regularity.There was something like rhyme, too, Dr. Bellugi thinks. That is, the girl modified the signs, giving them a poetic \u201cfeel\u201d and imparting a paral lelism that could be inter preted as rhyme. For exam ple, she brought the sign for \u201cyellow\u201d close to the hair, the noun it was to modify, and the sign \u201cblue\u201d close to its noun, her eyes. The result was that the signs, which would normally have been made out in front of the body, were partially similar in formation, just as rhymed words are partly similar in pronunciation.Despite all these differ ences and despite their se vere handicap, deaf chil dren appear to learn signs with no more difficulty than hearing children learn speech, Dr. Bellugi is finding. She has begun a series of long\u2010range studies of deaf children of deaf parents and is compar ing results with previous findings on language acqui sition in normal children by Prof. Roger W. Brown of Harvard.The Harvard study, in which Dr. Bellugi participat ed, suggested that children possess an innate prepared ness for language, which they learn through analysis, re constitution and experimen tation rather than by simple imitation.Dr. Bellugi hopes to trace the linguistic development of three deaf children from age 2 to 5, when language nor mally flowers. Each child visits the studio for one month for an hour and con verses with her mother be fore a camera. The video tapes are then analyzed and signs transcribed into an English \u201cgloss,\u201d a rough translation that allows com parison with speech although it does not give a good idea of the sophistication of sign.Comparable Progress MadeSome patterns have emerged. At age 2 years 7 months, the length of sign utterances for one subject, nicknamed Pola after the silent film star Pola Negri, was 1.69 signs. Six months later it had risen to 2.79, a gain roughly comparable to the progress found in speak ing children.As she matures, Pola seems to be reaching the same milestones noticed in normal children, building her vocab ulary, learning the different negative and questioning forms, and sometimes over generalizing rules as children do when they say such things as, \u201cI runned upstairs.\u201dDr. Bellugi has been partic ularly interested in detect ing overgeneralization. For instance, while the hearing can understand verb, subject and object from word order, the deaf depend on direction of the verb sign. Thus the object of the verb in \u201cdog bite cat\u201d would depend on the motion of \u201cbite.\u201d Some times, however, sign verbs are irregular and the rule does not apply. But Pola has been observed overgeneraliz ing such rules in the \u201cwrong place.\u201dCollaborating in the proj ect, which is supported by a $201,000 grant from the Na tional Institute of Health, are Dr. Susan D. Fischer, Nancy Frishbcrg, Richard Lacy, Patricia Siple, Mrs. Bonnie Gough (a deaf woman who helps translate) and Dr. Bellugi's husband, Prof. Ed ward S.

Lexington officials say the program is the nation's first effort to provide educational day care for pre\u2010nursery school deaf youngsters.\u201cThis Is basically a service program to aid the parents of the deaf, children, although the actual learning situation is an experimental research phase,\u201d Dr. Leo E. Connor, executive director of the school, said in an interview.The program uses two ma jor work areas\u2014a crib room for observation by teaching and medical staffs, and what is called a \u201ctotal stimulation\u201d playroom.An electrical engineer re tained by Dr. Connor de signed several stuffed ani mals that move, wiggle, wave, walk or light up at the sound of a human voice, giv ing the children strong in centive to mimic their teach ers in \u201ctalking\u201d to the ani mals. A limited budget of $25,000 has curbed more am bitious ideas for the program.\u201cThe problems that must be overcome with a deaf child are a loss of hearing, obviously, and a loss of speech,\u201d Dr. Connor said. \u201cWe're optimists here, and in our philosophy we're very different from almost every other school for the deaf in the United States.\u201cA Soundless World\u201dDr. Connors' optimism is reflected in the school's at tempt to reach deaf children at the earliest possible age. \u201cThe longer a child stays in a soundless world, the stronger the probability is that he will remain in that society, avoiding normal con tact with the hearing popula tion as much as possible,\u201d Dr. Connor explained.Before deaf children can speak, they must learn the more than 40 speech sounds of the English language. This process involves hours of practice in breath control, mouthing vowels and study ing speech positions of the tongue and palate on a plas tic and rubber model of the human mouth, called a speech master.To overcome the naturally poor sense of balance and rhythm of the deaf, the youngsters are taught to feel the vibrations of drums and piano; then they practice walking and dancing.A program or auditory testing and counseling gives the parents and school staff an idea of the child's hearing level, intelligence, potential, interests and needs. Students are fitted with hearing aids, which, together with espe cially sensitive classroom hearing aids, brings a meas ure of true sound to each child.Only profoundly deaf youngsters, with a hearing loss greater than 82 per cent, are accepted for admission to the school, which takes its name from its location,,,68th Street and Lexington Avenue.More than 360 pupils from kindergarten through 12th grade attend Lexington an nually. About 130 students live on the seven\u2010acre, $10\u2010 million campus, traveling home for weekends and va cation periods. New York State law provides for free education to deaf residents from 3 to 21 years of age. While educational program and teaching salaries are state\u2010financed, more than $100,000 is raised from pri vate funds yearly to support research and experimental projects."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/23/archives/housing-for-the-deaf-and-elderly-is-started.html", "headline": "Housing for the Deaf And Elderly Is Started", "date": "1971-10-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 23, 1971,  Page 43Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The delegates, who came from 47 countries, issued a \u201cdeclaration of the rights of the hard of hearing.\u201d The de\u2010I claration asked for medical and social measures that would give deaf people the same rights established for normal persons by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u201cThese measures,\u201d the decla ration said, \u201cshould sweep away outmoded opinions according to which the deaf have limited possibilities. These opinions are based on: prejudices that have shown themselves to be false.\u201dThe congress was held in the headquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The delegates generally addressed each other in international sign language and in mime as they milled in the halls. At the meetings the speeches were translated into sign language for the deaf participants.Society Termed PrejudicedThe general sentiment was that society took a prejudiced, paternal attitude toward the deaf and failed to give them the means to become full fledged citizens.\u201cIf we don't watch out, we will have Deaf Panthers,\u201d warned Dr. Hilde E. Schles inger, project director of the Mental Health Services for the Deaf in San Francisco.Dr. Cesare Magarotto of Italy, secretary general of the World Federation of the Deaf, declared at the inaugural ses sion Monday, \u201cIn the present world, a world in rapid evolu tion, the deaf and above all the seriously deaf find themselves in a particularly difficult and extremely painful situation in almost all countries.\u201dDr. Magarotto said that such services as detection, medical treatment, educational and pro fessional orientation, and job placement were at a minimum in most countries.\u201cWe want to affirm that it is impossible to talk of civili zation and of progress when millions of human beings are abandoned to the degradation of ignorance and to a vegeta tive life,\u201d he said.The situation in the under developed countries was de scribed as particularly tragic. A commission on help to the deaf in such countries noted that employment opportunities for the able\u2010bodied were gen lerally poor. \u201cFor the disabled, the prospects are often non existent,\u201d the commission said.There was general agreement that early detection was in dispensable for proper treat ment and training of persons with hearing problems. Medi cal experts said that modern techniques allowed such detec tion among infants.Where disagreement became evident was in the treatment. Majority opinion, the congress organizers reported, still fa vored only speech training to help the deaf integrate them selves into society. A minority view was that training in speech and in sign lan guage should be carried out together and that one helped the other. Those holding the minority view said that speech training alone would not help the deaf to communicate with one another."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/24/archives/the-deaf-now-hear-maos-thought.html", "headline": "The Deaf Now Hear Mao's Thought", "date": "1971-07-24T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 24, 1971,  Page 25Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Tientsin was one of the strong holds of Liu Shao\u2010chi.As a result the Cultural Revolution there was by no means peaceful. There was a good deal of factional fighting. Even in the summer of 1969 there was still trouble.One of the stories I got in Tientsin came from the school and workshop for the deaf.The school and workshop were established in October 1959 on the principle of self\u2010reliance and \u201cwalk on two legs\u201d launched by Chairman Mao. There had been nothing much in the way of training for deaf people in China. They had been the rejects, the unemployed, the worthless. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959, they too became useful. The school and workshop started in a few shacks and huts outside the city proper, on waste ground. There were 208 work ers, all deaf. They were taught sign language, and some could read. All were young.\u201cWe began in the Great Leap For ward by making steel,\u201d said Kung, the head of the revolutionary commit tee of the school. He is 32 years old, deaf, and was unable to speak until three years ago.They had no experts, no machines, no capital, no technicians. They cast low \u2010 grade steel by crude, primitive methods. Later they got cast\u2010off ma chinery, and made bicycle spare parts.Kung said: \u201cIn 1968 the No. 626 propaganda team of the People's Lib eration Army came to heal us. They did acupuncture on us, the new deep acupuncture that the medical team of the army had perfected to cure deaf ness.\u201dNo one knows why or how acupunc ture can cure or alleviate some cases of deafness. But it does. In this work\u2010 shop, 100 out of 208 now were radi cally improved.Kung himself had acupuncture 20 times. His hearing returned enough so that now when one shouts at him, he can hear. Before that, he could not hear at all. I asked him to shut his eyes to be sure he did not lip read, and shouted at him. He did hear, though not beyond ten feet. The army doctors also taught him to speak. \u201cSome of us had never spoken be cause we were deaf. Some still cannot speak. But others, like me, now speak.\u201cThe army explained that our deaf ness was because of exploitation: as children we were poor and ill, many of us became deaf through neglect and disease.\u201cI never spoke a word before 1968 when the army cured me.\u201d Now he was an eloquent activist and a propa gandist, going with a troupe of former deaf mutes to sing and dance and propagate Mao's thought. He talked for two hours. He was unquenchable.Kung organized the deaf. They went in a group to stop the factories from being burned. \u201cFor three days and three nights we were there speaking to the masses, telling them that state property is the people's.\u201dThe deaf workers shouted slo gans (sometimes incomprehensibly) or screamed uh\u2010uh (as still did those whom acupuncture had not cured) waved their little red books and stopped the onrush of the mob.Going round the factory, with its still primitive equipment and shacks, one noted extraordinary cheerfulness. I spoke to some of the 208 students; they shouted back, sometimes they only said uh\u2010uh and gestured and grinned.Afterward twelve formerly deaf girl workers gave me a small concert, cho rus singing, and group dancing. They could not hear themselves, not entirely. They were out of tune, and the words were distorted, but their faces shone with pride and happiness. They gave concerts weekly, in public, and were very popular, and many people now understood that deafness could be cured."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/04/archives/acupuncture-helps-the-deaf-in-china.html", "headline": "Acupuncture Helps the Deaf in China", "date": "1971-07-04T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 4, 1971,  Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

She is bright \u2010 eyed and alert but speaks haltingly. \u201cUntil one year and a halt ago,\u201d she said, \u201cI was deaf and mute.\u201dMiss Yeh spoke at the Peking No. 3 School for deaf mutes, who are being treated by doc tors with the ancient Chinese method of acupuncture \u2014 the puncturing of various nerve points with needles. Miss Yeh and her 14\u2010year\u2010old sister are among the 238 pupils at the school.The doctors say they have been successful in 90 per cent of the cases where the afflic tion is a result of a childhood disease. In the last two years, according to the doctors, they have sent 11 completely cured children into ordinary schools, where they are treated as nor mal children.There are three other schools for deaf mutes in Peking, and there are also said to he similar schools in every province.Wang Chen\u2010ying, a member of the school's propaganda team, said use of acupunture to treat deafness was discov ered in 1968 by an army medi cal team in northeast China. He said its members located the nerve points that affect hearing after repeated experiments on themselves.Teams were then sent all over China to set up schools and introduce the new methods into existing schools.Fang S hou \u2010 suan, an army doctor, said that if deafness can be cured, the students can be taught to speak. Language teaching is 70 per cent of the treatment, he said.\u201cAcupuncture spurs the nerve system and adjusts the hear ing nerve,\u201d Dr. Fang says. \u201cWe use several points. The acu puncture points near the ears have quick but temporary ef fects while the points farther away, as in the arms and hands, have a slower but per manent effect.\u201dThis writer toured some of the classrooms. The students range from 8 to 22 years of age and are divided into classes of 12, according to their ages and abilities.The rooms are airy with win dows on two sides. A black board covers the front wall and a portrait of Chairman MaoTse\u2010tung and displays of his sayings are on the opposite wall.A warm relationship was ap parent between the students and teachers, who spoke of the importance of encouraging each child individually.The classes are divided into four main categories. First are classes for the new students. Here they use finger language and charts to explain the treat ment process in store for the children. In the second cate gory they give the acupuncture treatments and test the hearing nerves for response. In the third, students are taught the basic sounds. Fourth are lan guage classes where the stu dents are taught to speak.In both the third and fourth types of classes mathematics, science and history are taught and the students are encour aged to reply orally.In the acupuncture room the teacher and an army medical aide inserted long needles near the ears and into the arms of the children. The insertion ap Ipeared to be painless. The needle is twisted by hand until the nerve is stimulated and the child utters a little cry.Dr. Fang said the students first undergo a 10\u2010day course of treatment and then rest for seven days.\u201cFor the first course we have a special set of points,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we check the progress report, and another set, depend ing on the results, is plotted for the second course.\u201d\u201cOn some students, the ef fect is quick, and we get good results in six months,\u201d he con tinued. \u201cMost cases take about a year, and in some cases, where the deafness was caused by brain injury or inflamma tion, it is very difficult.\u201dHe added that the treatment was usually more effective on younger students but that he and his colleagues attempted to cure all ages.Dr. Fang said they were still carrying out research and ex periments in an attempt to achieve better results.\u201cIf we can get the child to hear from a distance of 3 me ters, we know it will be all right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then carry on until the hearing reaches 20 meters. Then we stop acu puncture and concentrate on teaching them to speak.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/23/archives/hard-of-hearing-get-advice-for-college.html", "headline": "HARD OF HEARING GET ADVICE FOR COLLEGE", "date": "1971-05-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 23, 1971,  Page 36Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Mr. St. John made faces, blinked his eyes, smiled, frowned, leaned his head backward and forward as he caught and conveyed the nuances of the news, to the deaf.And from western Alabama to deep in Louisiana, thousands of deaf viewers gazed intently at their television sets, where in split\u2010screen fashion both Mr. Jennings and Mr. St. John were delivering the news.WJTV's double\u2010delivered 30\u2010minute news program is an outgrowth of one of the first efforts in the United States to bring television news to the deaf.\u201cWe started it some weeks ago at the request of some of the staff members from the school for the deaf,\u201d said Owens, Alexander, the station manager.In the beginning, the station experimented, by having sign language experts interpret during five\u2010minute news breaks in the morning programs of the Columbia Broadcasting System news. The experiment proved to be so popular that on March 1 WJTV began using the interpreters in the 5 o'clock slot, which was chosen because it was found that more deaf persons would be able to watch in the afternoon than in the morning.Dr. Robert S. Brown, director of the Mississippi School for the Deaf, estimated that the news programs were seen by 3,000 deaf persons, many of whom have rearranged their work, schedules so that they could watch.Split Screen ProblemThere have been some problems. Some non\u2010deaf viewers are distracted by the split screen, and the station has not yet been able to solve a technical problem that splits the screen during taped segments that are not interpreted.\u201cBut we're working on that and hope to have it solved very soon,\u201d said Mr. Alexander.The interpretation of the news is done on a rotating basis by Mr. St. John, who is a Baptist missionary, and by Hugh Prickett, principal of the Mississippi School for the Deaf."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/07/archives/stage-deafman-glance-robert-wilsons-story-of-a-black-youth-is.html", "headline": "Stage: \u2018Deaf man Glance\u2019", "date": "1971-03-07T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 7, 1971,  Page 60Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

He has created a new nonverbal, post\u2010Wagnerian epic theater composed partly of time and boredom, and partly of pastiche\u2010collage. At the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Friday night he gave us \u201cDeafman Glance,\u201d and it ended, very, very early yesterday morning. It had lasted rather more than three hours without an intermission. And indeed without even an explanation.This is a difficult review to write. Normally a critic has to write about safe, easily categorized people. But Wilson is something quite diferent. He first demands of his audience critical commitment. This Friday (the show, the exhibition, the event, the trip\u2014you label it\u2014had been seen once before last week) had attracted an avant\u2010garde aristocracy. Most of the audience seemed to love it, but some hissed, A very distinguished young playwright breezed out saying that it was like \u201cgreetings cards.\u201d He was wrong, I hope, but I could see what he meant. \u201cDeafman Glance\u201d is strange but vitally important.Wilson is not for skeptics. An unkind laugh, an uptight awareness of the illogicality of his dramatic position\u2014which is quite wild\u2014will destroy him. He has a strange and wonderful idea of the theater, but he needs the audience's trust. He could easily be a charlatan. He isn't, but you do need to suspend a little disbelief. But some of the loveliest things happen to us when we find the courage to suspend just that Disbelief is in the air like pollution\u2014look at Robert Wilson on his own terms.I have never encountered Wilson's work before. Last year he created something called \u201cThe Life and Times of Sigmund Freud,\u201d which missed but friends told me about it. The new \u201cDeafman Glance\u201d is about nothing\u2014it is a play without a plot, or perhaps it is even a plot without a play\u2014but the important thing is that it takes a static pose as a potentially dramatic attitude.Mr. Wilson sees life as an onlooker from out of a bus window\u2014a stalled bus at that. \u201cDeafman Glance\u201d has as its hero\u2014if it has a hero\u2014a young, black deaf boy, played by a boy who happens to be young, black and deaf, and who, in part, understand, inspired this Creation.What happens is very is easily explained. Indeed it is so easily explained, and it would sound so ridiculous if explained that I have no intention of explaining it. I think that Wilson wants us to look at the visual world with a pure observer's eye\u2014not its inexplicable grotesquerles and its mind\u2010nudging allusions\u2014and nothing could be more direct than a deaf eye.It is strange but if you tell the story of an ordinary play you have to write either a short story or a parable. Wilson is not to be written about in those nevertheless admirable terms. Let me tell you incidents. A dinner table\u2014like Alice but as sure as hell not in wonderland. At the head of the table is a giant frog crying crocodile tears, a man who looks like Sydney Greenstreet who has just been fired by, Warner Brothers, two ladies who probably came out of an Andy Hardy movie but have doubtless been frightened by Peter Lorre on their way to the theater. A waiter has red hair, and is contemptuously servile. Then there is also Dracula\u2014left forlorn at a funeral he hasn't even been invited to\u2014and a real live goat, and a real live pregnant woman, flowering and stark naked, and a monkey, and apes who come up from the inner earth and take over the world, and ladies waving parasols who come out of Henry James.Of course Mr. Wilson is doomed to be dubbed visual. And he most beautifully is. He has also created some fascinating time equations in the theater\u2014his phasing is very conscious and very slow. This is what gives it that fake Wagnerian purposefulness. Even the most suppressed and underpriveleged characters can be envisaged shouting Wagnerian catolyphrases to the silent air.It is a visual show. You think of Rousseau and Magritte, you remember the whole Dada ambiance, and yet also note the visual primitivism of the piece. And also Mr. Wilson is salutary in pointing out that our minds are a mass of literary litter. The show seems to take Proust, stubbed toes and all, as virtually its patron saint. It wants us to remember, but in a mist. It slows up the processes of recognition and analysis.I cannot see how Wilson with his cast of thousands\u2014most of them animal, vegetable or mineral\u2014and desperate yet kindly contempt, could ever become commercially viable. And the more I think about it, the more disturbed I am about the viability, commercial or whatever it is otherwise, of our theater. Yet Wilson could implode the minds of a new generation. His mind has a striding step to it."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/20/archives/electrical-device-used-to-treat-nerve-deafness-wide-variety-of.html", "headline": "Electrical Device Used to Treat \u2018Nerve Deafness\u2019", "date": "1971-02-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 20, 1971,  Page 35Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Dr. Henry K. Puharich and Dr. Joseph L. Lawrence as signed Patent 3,563,246 to the Intelectron Corporation, a New York com pany they found ed. At least half the patients ex perimentally treated through the facial nerves in this way have shown significant im provement, according to In telectron. The company cites a figure of about 8.5 million Americans with sensorineural hearing loss, or nerve deaf ness, for which there is now no generally accepted method of restoration.The patient wears a head set with a pair of electrodes placed in front of and behind each ear. Then the therapist switches on amplitude\u2010modu lated, low\u2010frequency radio waves. A typical treatment lasts an hour and is repeated daily for a month.The improved ability to distinguish words and other sounds is reported to last for days or weeks after a series of the transdermal ap plications and to be capable of maintenance by occasional treatments with a home unit.Intelectron plans prelimi nary distribution of ??he in struments to hospitals and other institutions. An earlier invention by Drs. Puharich and Lawrence, who now have 49 foreign and domestic patents, is a hearing aid in cluding a receiver installed in a hollow false tooth. This is expected to reach the mar ket within 18 months.Other apparatus, designed to enable aircraft pilots to hear despite deafening noise, has been demonstrated for the military services.Dr. Puharich has, done ex tensive research in neuro physiology, extrasensory per ception and telepathy.*Safety Youth GuiderAn assistant gardener for the New York City Depart ment of Parks, who has done much volunteer work with youth, got a patent this week on a means of shepherding children in groups.Reginald A. Nero of Brook lyn was granted Patent 3,563,208 for what he calls his safety youth guider. It consists of a flexible rod cov ered with luminous plastic, on each side of which are attached six or more short lengths of rope. The children grasp handles at the ends of the ropes, and the teacher or counselor holds on at the back.The ropes are colored so that the children can easily identify their own. Each guider may accommodate a dozen or more youngsters and may be distinguished from other units by a sign or flag at the front end of the bar.Mr. Nero was brought up with 16 brothers and sisters. Now he has three daughters and a son of his own. Since he got out of the Army, where his diversion was box ing, he has performed a va riety of community services.The inventor hopes to ar range for manufacture of his guider.*Mountain\u2010Climbing AidWilliam E. Forrest of Den ver was awarded Patent 3,563,430 this week for a bandoleer on which a moun tain climber can carry his pitons ready for use. A piton is a metal spike with an eye through which a rope may be passed. The word comes from the French for sharp peak.Retainers attached to the shoulder\u2010strung belt hold the pitons securely and release them under finger pressure.*Movable Leg RestDavid Pinkas, who oper ated a jewelry store in Nor walk, Conn., for 40 years, has perfected a rocking and rolling leg rest. Now a resi dent of Sun City, Ariz., where he hopes the warm climate will relieve his ar thritis, Mr. Pinkas received Patent 3,563,605 this week.The Rok 'N Rol is being manufactured by two North Carolina furniture companies. Rockers on each side of the frame support a flat uphol stered section on which the user lays his feet and legs. This tilts as he moves, mas saging his legs. But the an gle can be fixed if the occu pant wants to use the article as a stool.Mr. Pinkas says his com bination leg rest and seat can be shipped in knocked down condition and easily assembled.*Gum MassagerA California inventor who holds many patents on indus trial applications of sound waves was granted another this week for a tool to mas sage the gums.Patent 3,563,233, issued to Albert G. Bodine of Van Nuys, describes a hollow elastic wand in which a re volving rod is driven by a motor. The resonant sonic frequency, according to the patent, is one at which en ergy can be efficiently cou pled to the tissue. A soft applicator at the end of the wand touches the gums.Patent Office records rare ly show whether an inven tion is in production. To get a copy of a patent, send the number and 50 cents to the Commissioner of Patents, Washington, D. C. 20231. De sign patents are 20 cents each. To reach an inventor or assignee, if the address given is insufficient, write him care of Commissioner of Patents, being sure to cite the patent number."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/03/archives/deaf-couple-found-dead.html", "headline": "Deaf Couple Found Dead", "date": "1970-10-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 3, 1970,  Page 9Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

That's the whole philosophy be hind this program. I don't real ly care if the kids punch each other in the nose now and then. At least they're interacting.\u201dThere was not much nose punching \u2014 just enough to con vince Mr. Conti, a bearded 34\u2010year\u2010old who roams the campus in Bermuda shorts and sneak ers, that the students accepted each other as real people.\u201cIt was funny to watch them the first couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody was very cordial. But after the second week, it suddenly became more natural. There was no phony baloney. If you took my pencil, then you got a rap, whether you could hear or not.\u201dFederally FinancedThe State Department of Ed ucation, which supports the pri vately administered school, de cided that the summer program, which was federally financed, should include hard\u2010of\u2010hearing children who attend the public schools, rather than the school's own winter students, most of whom are totally deaf.The 152\u2010year\u2010old school is home for 300 deaf students, who can go there from nursery school through high school.Twenty\u2010one hard\u2010of\u2010hearing students were recruited for the program, which ended today, through the Board of Coopera tive Educational Services, a di vision of the department, which Provides special educational services to school districts out side the state's major cities.The hard\u2010of\u2010hearing stu dents were asked to bring normally hearing friend. Seven of the students brought a broth er or sister. A few brought school friends and some found their \u201cbuddies\u201d with the help of the educational services of fice.The students, who ranged in age from 8 to 15, came from Staten Island, Long Island and upstate Broome County. Their hearing losses varied from mod erate to severe, and all but one used a combination of a hearing aid and lip reading to\u2019 understand speech. Most spent at least part of the school day in special classes.This five\u2010day\u2010a\u2010week res idential program \u2014 the children returned to their homes on the weekends \u2014 was a combination of summer school and summer camp.An average day began with three hours of school in the morning, when buddies attend classes together in language skills, science, art and typing.In the afternoon, students chose from a list of electives that included drama, dance, horseback riding, a theater\u2010tel evision workshop and sports. In the evenings, there were movies; dances, and trips to Shakespeare in the Park, the rodeo at Madison Square Gar den, Playland in Rye and other attractions in the area.\u201cThe hearing kids learned lot more than they thought they would,\u201d Mr. Conti said. \u201cA lot of them thought that the deaf kids would be dummies and that they would be the ones giving all the help. But then they saw the other kids ride up with them in class and es pecially in sports.\u201dThere will be a formal eval uation of the program this fall, including a comparison of the scores each child received on the California Achievement Test administered at the be ginning and end of the summer. Mr. Conti said that some of the children, both hearing and hard of hearing, had improved their scores by several school grades.This summer's program cost about $19,000. Mr. Conti said that he hoped to expand the program next summer, and in clude deaf children as well as the hard of hearing."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/08/archives/actress-on-panel-for-deaf.html", "headline": "Actress on Panel for Deaf", "date": "1970-08-08T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 8, 1970,  Page 10Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

They all catch colds and because they brought no handkerchiefs they have to use tissues. The paper is too thin and their fingers go through it and there's nothing that annoys a tourist like having a cold and dirtying his fingers at the same time.\u201dHe continued: \u201cIt's Impossible to find a policeman who speaks French to show you the way. In the \u201c shops the salesgirls are unable to convert inches into centimeters. No one holds a door open for you and in revolving doors the person ahead of you always expects the person behind to push.\u201cIn the hotels . . . it's impossible to open a window. It's like an icy cage. No point in ringing for the chambermaid or a waiter. They are deaf and in any case don't understand a word of French. There is, of course, an interpreter, but he is never around. The telephone works wonderfully, but the switchboard girl doesn't understand what you say to her.\u201cThe subway is dirty and smelly and the directions are so brief that it's impossible to find your way. The same in the buses, which carry no indication where they are going. There is nothing but the taxis, if they understand you or if they don't in order to up the price on you.\u201cAdmittedly we didn't come to America to eat well, but after all\u2014a steak at $5 and mayonnaise on the fruit salad.\u201dBernard Malandin, French vice consul in New York, called the newspaper report \u201cgreatly exaggerated\u201d and said that the French Consulate here had not had any increase in the number of complaints from tourists.However, Mr. Malandin said that he did not think that New York was really geared to handle tourists from abroad."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1964/06/07/archives/deaf-collegians-hear-johnson-hail-education.html", "headline": "Deaf Collegians \u2018Hear\u2019 Johnson Hail Education", "date": "1964-06-07T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 7, 1964,  Page 67Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

They gather soon after 3 P.M., Mondays through Fridays, on the southbound platform of the 14th Street station of the IRT Lexington Avenue line.Conversing animatedly in sign language, they exchange jokes and experiences and make social plans, undisturbed by the clatter of trains.The station long ago became their rendezvous because it is a handy interchange point for pupils from various schools in the city.One recent afternoon as many as 24 of the youngsters were there at one time. There was no audible conversation, but sometimes laughter could be heard as a joke was told.Occasionally a passerby stopped and stared at the children, some of whom were wearing hearing aids. Most travelers appeared, however, to be unaware of the informal social gathering.At times, the children divided into groups, more or less according to age. There were boys and girls, both white and Negro. The youngest looked to be about 13; several might have been 17.Some of them attend Public School 47, a school for the deaf, at 225 East 23rd Street. Others attend the Lexington School for the Deaf. 904 Lexington Avenue at 67th Street, the William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City, and the New York State School for the Deaf in White Plains.Some concern over the choice of the subway station as a gathering place was expressed by Mrs. M. Catherine Wilman, principal of Public School 47.Mrs. Wilman said she had been trying for years to discourage her pupils from going there. She believes they are in danger of being preyed on by narcotics pushers and perverts.Once, however, after she had warned the youngsters. against congregating at 14th Street, she, learned that some were meeting in the Times Square IRT station, a place she considers \u201cfar worse.\u201dMrs. Wilman sympathizes with the desire of the children to meet other deaf youngsters. \u201cThey just adore getting together with each other,\u201d she said, but she hopes that other facilities may attract them.She noted that the Jewish Society for the Deaf was planning a community center near the school for next year and she would like to see the children go there after classes.Meanwhile, she tries to discourage the subway gatherings by urging parents to see that their children return home directly from school.\u201cThis practice shouldn\u2019t be limited just to deaf children; It should apply to all,\u201d she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/motors-easy-touch-for-deaf-mechanic-alfano-tunes-them-by-their.html", "headline": "Motors Easy Touch for Deaf Mechanic; Alfano Tunes Them by Their Vibration Instead of Sound; Spring Rush Keeps Freeporter Busy With Outboards", "date": "1964-04-05T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 5, 1964, Section S, Page 18Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

If they are more sensitive than average fingertips, it's understandable. Alfano was left deaf by spinal meningitis when he was 2 years old and has to tune by vibration instead of sound.At 45, he looks back on 16 years of study at the New York School for the Deaf in New York City and White Plains, which he entered at the age 4, and a useful life as a painter, deckhand, carpenter and mechanic.Alfano, who does not speak, scribbled answers to written questions with an ever\u2010present smile. It was a smile that seemed to confirm what his associates say\u2014that he is a man of unfailing humor as long as he is doing work that requires talent. The truth is that he is a practical joker.Alfano has been known to solder a coin to a nail on a counter top and then double up in mirth while one customer after another tried to pick it up.During the quiet months, he has no trouble maneuvering his 5\u2010foot\u20105\u2010inch, 142\u2010pound frame under boat bottoms as he scrapes and paints, but he makes no secret of his distaste for that phase of his work.Alfano, who is unmarried, spends his leisure hours in front of a television set watching sports programs, in a bowling alley keeping up his 165 average or in his backyard building cars for the races at Freeport Stadium.He writes his favorite automobile story with only slight encouragement, though it doesn't pertain to racing. It seems Alfano was teaching a young friend how to drive when a police officer stopped them because of a traffic violation.\u201cThe officer was chewing me out\u2014I could tell from his face \u2014but I couldn't hear a word he was saying,\u201d wrote Alfano. \u201cMy friend, who has a speech impairment, was stammering an explanation to the officer. All of a sudden, the officer scratched his head, said something, closed his summons book and walked away.\u201cI asked my friend in sign language what it was all ' about and my friend gestured that the officer said, \u2018Forget it!\u2019 \u201dAlfano puts in an eight\u2010hour day and works regularly. When his co\u2010workers want to get his attention, they stamp on the floor. He feels the vibration no matter where he is in the shop.He also indicates, as he grins, that he is the head of the complaint department. Grover denies this but admits that once in a while he is strongly tempted to direct an \u201cimpossible\u201d customer to Alfano.Grover says Alfano is skilled in clutch and water\u2010pump work, does a good job on inspections and can set a carburetor.\u201cFor the most part, I think Harry is good for our customer relations,\u201d said Grover. \u201cMost of our regulars like him and use rudimentary sign language or write notes when they are dealing with him.\u201dAlfano reputedly is a good man in the galley, too. His favorite foods are spaghetti, steak, fresh ham, chocolate pudding and peach pie. He takes nothing stronger than a fruit cocktaiI.When the boating season is in full swing, sometimes it is necessary for Alfano to pump gas to boats at the dock.\u201cI think there are two reasons why Alfano doesn't like to pump gas,\u201d said one of his as\u2010 sociates. \u201cFirst, it is beneath his dignity because he wants to handle only the top\u2010notch chores. Secondly, he gets annoyed because he has to put out his cigarette or risk being blown into the Woodcleft Canal.\u201dAlfano, after years on the waterfront, dismisses this conjecture with the brevity of an old salt from Cape Cod:\u201cBaloney,\u201d he scribbled, \u201cI can't swim!\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1948/10/02/archives/the-screen-in-review-jane-wyman-gives-a-sensitive-performance-as.html", "headline": "THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Jane Wyman Gives a Sensitive Performance as Deaf-Mute in 'Johnny Belinda'", "date": "1948-10-02T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 2, 1948,  Page 0Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

And, having done so, it is surprising what a good film they've made of it.Not that they've whipped out an epic in this somewhat expanded report on the spiritual flowering of a deaf-mute under the attentions of a young doctor on a Nova Scotian farm. And not that they've thoroughly rid it of the oddly suspicious breath of theatrical melodramatics which it strongly exuded on the stage. Put at least they have made a picture which has a novel and genuine theme. And at best they have made it quite moving. It is now showing at the Strand.Perhaps the foremost reason for this happy accomplishment is the sensitive and poignant performance of Jane Wyman in the central role. As the drab and indeed repulsive deaf-mute whose bleak life is brightened and blessed by the helpful instruction of a young doctor and the birth of an illegitimate child (which is an unrelated coincidence and not a consequence), Miss Wyman brings superior insight and tenderness to the role. Not once does she speak throughout the picture. Her face is the mirror of her thoughts. Yet she makes this pathetic young woman glow with emotional warmth.Even the scenes in which she follows the instruction of the doctor, Lew Ayres, in expressing herself in sign language are affecting, despite the fact that the speed with which she learns is amazing and the symbols seem at times a bit absurd.A further asset to the picture is the quality of its decor. Good, simple, cracker-barrel interiors have the flavor of the village and the farm. And landscapes which run down to the sea's edge, village streets, fishing boats and weathered barns look as though they might be indigenous to Cape Breton Island, even though they are not.Under the able direction of Jean Negulesco, Mr. Ayres makes a credibly humble young doctor in a hamlet of gossipy folks. And Stephen McNally, who (as Horace McNally) played the doctor on the stage, is forcibly brutish as the town sport who secretly violates the girl. As father and aunt of the poor girl, Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead are good, too, and Jan Sterling does rather nicely as a doxy who can't keep still.Some of the scenes are pretty lurid, especially towards the end, when the deaf girl is forced to shoot the scoundrel as he comes to take her baby away. And a courtroom scene for the climax is a little grotesque when not banal. But the best of the film is absorbing, and Miss Wyman, all the way through, plays her role in a manner which commands compassion and respect.On the stage at the Strand are Andre and Steve Calgary, Blair and Dean and Freddy Martin and his orchestra.JOHNNY BELINDA; screen play by Irmgard von Cube and Allen Vincent, from the stage play by Elmer Harris; directed by Jean Negulesco; produced by Jerry Wald for Warner Brothers Pictures.

A [???]evel feature of the exercises was an old-fashioned spelling-match, wherein about thirty intelligent boys competed for a handsome copy of Mr. N.P. WILLIS's [???]ms. This prize was won by Master WOODRUFF. Oth[???] prizes were taken by Masters COOPER. HOWE and MARY. The music, which was given under direction [???] Prof. WOODMAN, was very fine, and the exercises in proclamation reflected credit upon the boys who \"spake in public on the stage\" as well as to their accomplished tutor. Speeches were made by several gentlemen, among the number Rev. Dr. OSGOOD.An ornamental hair line in a new style of script type [???]t many ladies and gentlemen to Grammar School No. 17, in West Forty-seventh-street, at 7 o'clock last evening, when they should have gone at 1 o'clock.

Of course everybody knew that something unusual was about to happen; but the mischievous boys were reticent until one of the professors, who is a slave to the Virginia weed, called a class, and then almost the entire school fell upon him with an avalanche of Cavendish and Lilienthal, Lorillard and Anderson, Cornish and McAlpin, and we don't know how many other choice brands of fine[???]ut, plug and twist.The Messrs. ENGELSMANN have established, at No. 36 West Twenty-seventh-street, an institution wherein they teach the deaf and dumb to express their thoughts in gutterals. The pupils comprehend with facility common words and phrases by observing the movements of the lips, teeth and tongue of the speaker. This method of teaching the deaf and dumb to speak is not by any means new; it was known and practiced in the seventeenth century, but for reasons that have not been explained fell into disuse, and was but recently revived. There are several schools in Europe like that of the Messrs.

Early in the morning, crowds, many hundreds, of people who had learned from the TIMES and other journals of the anticipated visit of the deaf and dumb children to the fair, thronged the building. We have never, save on one or two evenings, saw the large halls so densely packed as at this time. Messrs. CARPENTER, CHAMBERS, TILLMAN, BRIDGMAN and other of the managers, radiant with the flush of success, and decorated gaily with the roseate cockade, had their hands full to keep the passages clear, while the good-looking M.P.'s, who were just as good-natured and complaisant as they were on the night of the opening, were more than busy in preserving order.At about 11 o'clock. Prof. PEET, of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, arrived, accompanied by several teachers and two hundred and fifty of the pupils, who ranged in years from ten to twenty. The next three or four hours were passed by these curious and inquisitive little people in examining, noting and comprehending the mysteries of the fair. They seemed particularly pleased with the machinery department, and hung about the sewing machines for a long time. The photographs and other pictures delighted them, and it was sadly interesting to watch the eager anxious expression of their faces as one would explain to the other the beauties or advantages of any particular object.They [???] at and smelled of the flowers, examined the photographs, touched the keys of the pianos, felt of the garments made by the knitting-machine, looked with perfect as [???]ment at the tremendous volume of water that is forced up by the pump in the corner, tasted with evident delight delight the vain is prepared on the patent steam-stove, rode on the rocking-horses, accepted [???]ture horse shoes that were made for them on the spot from straight, stiff piece of lead wondered at the brick machine, stood with unconcern and indifference at the side of the shricking steam-whistle drunk steam-water by the quart, tested the spring mattresses, looked languishingly at the pretty girls who work the sewing-machine, passed hastily by the ugly [???], were, in the fine, delighted and transported by what they saw, and evidently regarded Messrs. CARPENTER & CO. as the greatest philanthropists this side the flood.At 4 o'clock, or thereabouts, Mr. CARPENTER mounted the platinum, followed by Prof. PEET and half a dozen male and female pupils. Instantly some five or six hundred visitors gathered about in expectation of an exhibition. Mr. CARPENTER explained that Prof. PEET would draw from the deaf mutes certain indications of intelligence and observation from which the audience could infer the progress made by them. The first pupil was a bright-eyed young boy whose countenance was all aglow with the excitement of the occasion, The Professor made certain signs to him which he instantly interpreted, writing the explanation on a blackboard. Prof. PEET then spelled out lion, tiger, rat, dog -- at each of which the little fellow gave in pantomime a most lifelike and interesting solution.A young lady of about 20 years, then gave in pantomime the sign language of a bit of descriptive writing, after which, Prof. PEET read an address of thanks to the manager, which was written at the time by one of the girls.Other and similar exercises followed, showing to what a remarkable degree the senses of sight and smell were cultivated, and with what readiness and facility the pupils understood and answered all explanation.A more interesting scene we have rarely witnessed.Prof. LOWE is to deliver a lecture on the science and practice of ballooning, at the Institute, after which he will send up a model balloon, drawing the same down by means of a jolly and wonderfully excited little engine.there will be a race, between men wearing one and two artificial legs; the same will be held at night."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/03/archives/partial-deafness-and-discharges-from-the-ear.html", "headline": "Partial Deafness and Discharges from; THE EAR.", "date": "1865-06-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 3, 1865,  Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

HARTLEY generously offers to attend all persons suffering from affections of the ear at his consultation rooms, No. 1,166 Broadway, without charge, until cured, thereby proving his success unequaled, and protecting the deaf from being swindled by paying self-styled aurists exorbitant fees in advance, and the infliction of still more serious evils, by permitting the application of dangerous remedies by inexperienced and unskillful hands. Dr. H. may here state that he has no connection whatever with any person advertising to cure deafness, neither has he given permission for the publication of a certificate purporting to emanate from him, and cannot, therefore, be responsible for any alarming consequences resulting from rashness and desperation. The loss of money may not be material to some persons, but the deprivation of one of the most important of the senses ought to be regarded and treated with more than ordinary solicitude. Deafness, noise in the head, and all disagreeable discharges from the ear, speedily and permanently removed, without causing the least pain or inconvenience. A cure in all cases guaranteed where malformation does not exist. Seventeen years' close and almost undivided attention to this branch of special practice, has enabled him to reduce his treatment to such a degree of success, as to find the most, confirmed and obstinate cases yield by a steady attention to the means prescribed.The following testimonials are submitted with confidence:DOCTOR HARTLEY:DEAD, SIR: In answer to your letter of yesterday, I have only to say that you have my permission to use my name, and I shall be very happy to satisfy any inquiry regarding your skill and professional abilities in the department of practice to which you devote your attention.Very respectfully yours, &c.,D.C.

A very large audience was present. Mr. H.P. PEET, the Vice-Principal, stated that the institution contained 360 pupils, ranging in age from 12 to 25 or 30 years. The pupils present were merely a delegation, consisting of about thirty lads and young men, and about twenty-five young ladies. On being received in the institution, the first thing was to teach them the sign language and the finger alphabet. The latter could be learned in a few months, pupils who had entered the institution last September being now able to converse by its aid with facility.Several pupils then translated various words into sign language, and exhibited the method of conversing by means of signs, and also by the finger, brachial and facial alphabets. A young lady translated one of SHELLY's poems, comencing\"I bring fresh showersTo the thirsty flowers,\"into sign language, and a former pupil of the institution, now a teacher, rendered MARC ANTONY's oration over CAESAR's body by means of signs. Several questions were propounded by the audience, to which the pupils answered in writing, showing their ability to express their ideas with correctness and facility. Mr. PEET stated that he had lately introduced a telegraphic alphabet which many of the pupils had already acquired. The audience appeared greatly interested by the exhibition, which occupied several hours."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/03/archives/chronic-catarrh-its-symptoms-causes-and-effects-a-few-practical.html", "headline": "CHRONIC CATARRH: ITS SYMPTOMS, CAUSES AND EFFECTS.; A FEW PRACTICAL REMARKS BY DR.

Insignifiacnt as it appears in its first stages, it is apt in its progress to become instrumental in causing the loss or impairment of smell, taste, hearing and sight, and of creating serious constitutional derangements, not unfrequently terminating in consumption.A feeling of irritation, sensitiveness, heat or pain is experienced in the nose, the edges of which are red and swollen, and which is stopped up sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, and occasionally on both, rendering respiration through it either difficult or impossible. The irritation in the nose produces a frequent desire to sneeze, and is accompanied with a discharge of either clear aerid water, or what is far oftener the case, a profuse, thick, yellowish and extremely offensive matter, which forms one of the most characteristic features of the disease, and is a source of the greatest annoyance and danger. As the disease progresses, this secretion becomes purulent, increases in quantity, and assumes an exceedingly fetid odor. It escapes not only by the nose, but passes into the throat, producing irritation there, and requiring frequent expectoration, hawking or scraping for its removal. As its passage into the throat is very much facilitated by a horizontal position of the body, sleep is frequently disturbed by a sensation of choking in consequence, and many are obliged to lie in a semi-recumbent position to obtain the necessary sleep.Owing to the heat in the head the watery portion of the discharge often evaporates, and assuming a condition of solidity, is deposited upon the membrane of the nose and upper part of the throat, in the shape of crusts or hardened lumps. The accumulation of these incrustations produces a feeling of discomfort, and narrows the nasal passages so as to embarrass respiration. Therefore, frequent efforts have to be made to remove them, either by forcibly blowing the nose, or by persistent hawking -- a practice as disagreeable to the one affected as it is to those around him. After the removal, that side of the incrustation which adhered to the mucous membrane will sometimes be found bloody, a fact which explains the force required for its dislodgment. During sleep these incrustations accumulate more rapidly, and the feeling is therefore most uncomfortable in the morning. Sometimes all efforts to clear the throat are futile until after breakfast, or after some stimulant had been swallowed. Ulceration of the mucous membrane of the nose takes place frequently, sometimes attacking the bones, when small particles of that substance will occasionally be found mixed with the discharge.The breath assumes an excessively fetid and sickening odor, and becomes occasionally so offensive as to render the patient an object of disgust to himself as well as to others.The accumulation of the discharge, together with the thickened condition of the mucous membrane, renders respiration through the nasal passages very difficult, and oftentimes impossible, necessitating respiration principally through the mouth -- a method very deleterious to the general health, but more particularly so to the lungs, which become weak and irritable. The voice loses its musical quality, and assumes a discordant, harsh and nasal character; the sense of smell becomes much impaired or entirely lost, and the same effect, though less frequent, is produced on taste. Occasionally, while blowing the nose, a crackling or bubbling sound is heard in the ears, and hearing becomes quite thick or stopped up, but returns suddenly with something like a snapping sound. This phenomena may be repeated several times, until hearing doss not return, but remains permanently injured. In other cases hearing is lost so gradually that a considerable degree of deafness may exist before the person is really aware of the fact. Either condition is often accompanied with noises in the head of every conceivable description, materially increasing the distress of the sufferer.The eyes are apt to become weak, irritable and disposed to water on exposure to cold and wind, or after the slightest exertion. A pain, more or less acute, or a distressing feeling of pressure, is experienced over the eyes, and sometimes on the top or back of the head, and also pain in the face, closely resembling neuralgia, for which it is very often mistaken. The distress in the head weakens the memory, and produces irritability and moroseness of disposition. The stomach generally suffers more or less, is weak and irritable; the appetite is capricious, and is nearly always bad in the morning. In severe cases the system becomes feeble and prostrated.This is manifested by a disposition to drowsiness and sleep, an aversion to either physical or mental exertion, and a feeling of fatigue and weakness.Not unfrequently catarrh proves fatal, either by debilitating the system and wearing out the patient, or by traveling downward, and producing throat affections, bronchitis, and finally consumption. It may be safely asserted that, after hereditary predisposition, catarrh is the most frequent and important cause of this fatal complaint.The symptoms of catarrh vary considerable in different individuals, and the degree of their severity depends upon constitutional idiosyncrasies and various external influences. With some the complaint continues for a number of years in a mild form, and without causing any of the injurious results above described, while with others all the worst effects are produced in a short space of time, and cases, apparently most harmless, may, through imprudent exposure, additional cold, or unfavorable changes of the weather, suddenly exhibit all the violence and malignity which characterizes the severest ones.Any inflammation of the mucous membrane of the throat or nose is favorable to the production of Catarrh. Ordinary colds, if neglected or aggravated by additional exposure, are very apt to become chronic and run into Catarrh, and are the cause in nearly two-thirds of all the cases that present themselves. Scarlet fever, measles, diphtheria, and all the diseases affecting the throat, the inhalation of dust, impure atmosphere or aerid vapors, are among its most frequent inciting causes. Catarrh attacks in preference those possessing a feeble or scrofulous constitution and a lymphatic temperament; individuals of soft fibres, respiring an impure or confined atmosphere, or whose systems are debilitated by insufficient or unsubstantial nourishment; persons enervated by severe memtal labor, physical excesses or exhaustive diseases; those who lead a life of indolence, or dwell, either from choice or necessity, in damp, ill-ventilated places, deprived of pure air and the necessary sunshine. Persons who are exposed to the vicissitudes of the weather, or insufficiently protected against cold, scrofulous children, chlorotic females and these recently confined. In fact, whatever debilitates the system or vitiates the constitution, favors the development of catarrh. Its great prevalence in this country is owing to the sudden and frequent changes of the weather and temperature, to the extensive travel by rail where persons are confined in dusty, badly-ventilated, over-crowded and overheated cars. With the mail population it can often be traced to the extensive and inordinate use of tobacco, which enervates the system and produces local inflammation of the mucous membrane of the throat. In the females, to indolent and sedentary habits and their confinement to darkened rooms and parlors, whence the beneficent sunshine is sedulously excluded for the benefit of furniture, carpets, and complexion. This style of living renders the constitution weak and puny, highly sensitive to cold or to changes of the weather, and unable to resist any shock to the system. With children it often arises from the foolish and imprudent exposure of their arms and legs, which are left uncovered from a fancied idea that it improves their appearance. This practice cannot be too severely reprehended, for it causes an unequal circulation and consequent congestions. As the mucous membrane of the nasal passages is the most sensitive surface exposed, repeated attacks of cold are the result of this absurd custom, and catarrh not unfrequently follows.Catarrh has been considered an incurable disease, and on the strength of that supposition, has been neglected by both the profession and the public.The author has for years past made this complaint his special study; was the first to publish a minute description of its nature, symptoms and effects, and has, by doing so, directed the attention of both the profession and the public to the vast importance of the subject.By the established success of the treatment as instituted and perfected by him, he has proved beyond dispute the curability of catarrh, if properly treated. All doubts of the corrected of this statement will be dispelled by the perusal of the annexed testimonials from parties occupying well-known positions in society.CLARENDON HOTEL, NEW-YORK.I take pleasure in recommending Dr. Lighthill to those affected with catarrh or diseases of the throat, as I have myself suffered for some years past from those difficulties, and been relieved by the Doctor's efficient and skillful treatment.J.S.

Dating the commencement of his work at a time when deaf-mute instruction in this country was not only a mystery, but by many was believed an impossibility; without text-books or authorities, thrown on his own ingenuity and resources, he devised a philosophic system of education and domestic management that has resulted in placing the New-York institution at the head of all kindred establishments; while his writings, embodied in reports and magazine articles, have done much to enlighten the public mind, and awaken sympathy with an unfortunate class of the community.The love and appreciation in which the aged Principal is held by the inmates were visible in the cordial greetings and marks of tender regard that followed his appearance on Saturday morning. Then succeeded floral presentations, congratulatory speeches, general amnesty to delinquents, and a holiday. The evening was occupied by tableaux, and a pantomimic entertainment given by the pupils, and exceedingly creditable to their taste and fertility of resource."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/07/archives/cure-of-a-deaf-mute-louis-loeweinstein.html", "headline": "CURE OF A DEAF MUTE.

The more striking affections of the Ear seem to depend upon the greater constitutional vigor of the individual than Nature is capable of sustaining, or of such alterations in the structure of the interior of the organ of Hearing, as leads to a change in their constituent parts, or to its becoming productive of sympathy in the surrounding portions. For all these varied obstacles the [???]urist must be prepared, and he must bear in mind that almost every case requires a different mode of treatment, and that it is quite out of the question to attempt to lay down general laws.It has been justly said: \"That a man without hearing is fit for nothing, not even to go to church.\" He who has once been deaf and has recovered his hearing, will best appreciate such an observation, and most particularly if he should belong to the class of individuals dependent entirely for their daily subsistence upon the hearing with which Nature has endowed them for their varied pursuits.The object of my consideration is to point out the means by which the diseases of the Ear -- whether they are of a trifling or of an aggravated character -- may be avoided; for it would not be productive of benefit to the reader or to the surgeon simply to state what is to be done when the maladies are present, but to show what precautions may be taken to prevent their approach. The old adage -- \"Prevention is better than cure\" -- is as judicious as it is necessary; and if we cannot, from our habits of life, pay much attention to a fullness in the ear, or a little discharge or difficulty in hearing, we may nevertheless remember how much of good is to be derived from care and immediate attention, and how bitter is the suffering when the Hearing is entirely lost. Indeed, upon due observance and proper management of the organ of which we now treat depends, in a greater or less degree, the general health of the human body, and the integrity of all its different functions. By early attention it is easy to arrest those diseases of a chronic character whose progress toward a fatal termination is certain and inevitable, and from which there is but is slender chance of escape from being completely deaf. It is a theme which has occupied the pen of numerous writers, and given origin to a multitude of books. Indeed, the subject of treating Deafness seems to be almost inexhaustible. Theory is heaped on theory, doctrine upon doctrine; but we are too often apt to forget that experience and practice are far surer laws by which to be guided, than all the theory and all the doctrine that was ever preached.It is a very curious circumstance that deafness is much more frequent in males than in females, which is in violation of the ordinary law, that, as the power of formation is weaker in the female foetus than in the male, so are the deficiencies more frequent. Mr. MAY, the director of the Deaf and Dumb School in Vienna, stated that the proportion of deaf boys to girls was as four to one. Congenital deafness does not appear to be hereditary, as most of the parents of deaf children have no defect of their organs, and it is a rare circumstance to meet a case of a deaf child who was the fruit of parents either one or both of whom were similarly afflicted. On the other hand, several children of one family will be thus affected without any known cause, while the others will remain perfectly healthy. KRAMER relates a singular instance of a man and his wife, of the name of HARTNESS, both of them healthy, and having no hereditary predisposition to any disease of the Ear in their family on either side, who have five daughters and six sons. The latter were all born deaf and dumb, while the daughters, without exception, heard perfectly well. This confirms what I before stand, that the more striking affections of the Ear seem to depend upon the greater constitutional vigor of the individual.In its pathology the Ear does not differ from other structures. From this general conclusion, perhaps, may be excepted inspissation of wax in the meatus, the exact analogue of that secretion not being elsewhere found. Inflammation, therefore, is the affection to which, for the most part, this organ is obnoxious; and as this disease is modified in its progress, in its symptoms, and in its effects, by the structures which it attacks -- by the local predisposition of the organ affected -- by the general constitution of the individual -- by the causes which may excite it -- by the external circumstances or conditions which accompany it -- so have the affections of the Ear been arranged under various heads, nearly all of which may be reduced to inflammation and its consequences. As in all other organs of which the seat of the function is in an expanded nerve, the Ear is likewise subject to an anaesthetic affection dependent on some hidden morbid condition, and occasionally on inflammation, either of the acoustic nerve, or of those parts of the brain in connection with the organ. The brain, in consequence of its vicinity to the Ear, often participates in the diseases and accidents of that organ, and the reverse is frequently observed of disease extending from the ear to the brain or skull. Lastly, the accidental introduction of foreign bodies into the meatus, the rupture by a blow, or othewise, of the membrana tympani, has been esteemed peculiar to the Ear, but perhaps hardly with justice, as nearly similar accidents are met with in the nasal and visual organs.Until within a few years the facts connected with the Ear were so scattered, and the conclusions deduced so vague, the diseases were so little understood and so mal-arranged, that the term ear-ache was applied to every disease of which the symptoms were very evident, though the case remained in obscurity. Cases have presented themselves to me in which I have had occasion to find the general practitioner not so accurate in the diagnosis as he should be, from the carelessness with which he has been accustomed to treat the Diseases of the Ear. The consequence of this has been that they have mistaken diseases which demanded the simplest treatment for others which must be more actively met, or the system will succumb. It is true, since Sir BENJAMIN BRODIE has in his masterly treatise explained some of the phenomena attendant upon Diseases of the Ear, that more just estimates have been formed of the nature of those affections to which the Ear is subject, and the real cause of the diseases more precisely ascertained. All that is demanded is a thorough knowledge of what can be done. I have no secret; I have no nostrum; experience is what I rely upon.The symptoms of the severe affections which threaten and indeed are likely to result in complete deafness, are sometimes ushered in by a momentary pain in the ear, which is often neglected and regarded as being what is commonly called earache, and which may continue for a few hours, or may persist with occasional exacerbations for two or three days, when it more or less suddenly extends to the whole side of the head. In other cases the symptoms commence with hemicrania, or insupportable headache. The febrile excitement is most severe; the eyes are injected, watery, and intolerant of light; the countenance is flushed and anxious; the skin hot and dry; the pulse frequent and hard; the secretions suspended; the pain becomes excessive and extends throughout the whole head, but is more severe on the side affected, and the patient particularly refers as the most painful part, to the bottom of the Auditory canal. Sinnitus Aurium is a frequent distressing accompaniment. The pain is increased by noises, even the slightest, and by the movement of the jaw and attempts at deglutition. It frequently shoots through the brain, and extends to the fauces. The disease is attended by delirium, often very violent at the onset, but, toward the close, becoming low and muttering, and with occasional rigors. In its progress, the inflammation spreads to the mastoid process, which becomes hot and painful on pressure, as well as to the pharynx and tonsils, which are then tumified and reddened. The severity of the symptoms frequently abates in the morning, a reaccession often accompanied by rigors coming on in the evening. The patient is also deaf on the affected side.So far, the symptoms, though indeed acute, are insufficient to distinguish inflammation of the tympanum from the most severe form of inflammation of any other portion. To perfect the diagnosis, it is necessary to ascertain that the Auditory canal is free from disease, and to take into consideration the longer interval of time between the first accession of pain and appearance of discharge. In external inflammation, the muco purulent secretion occurs in a few days, or even in a few hours. In the internal disease, a week or more will elapse before any matter is discovered, and then it escapes suddenly either through a rupture of the membrana tympani, through the Eustachian tubes, or through the ulcerated mastoid cells; whereas the external disease is preceded by a serous moisture, and the nervous apparatus which receives the sonorous undulations from the tympanum and conveys them to the brain -- one of the most delicate structures of the human body -- is liable to many functional and organic derangements. As some cases of Deafness, dependent upon the derangement of the nervous apparatus connected with the organ of Hearing, appears to be caused by the condition of the brain generally, or that part in intimate relation with the acoustic nerve, it would be very advantageous for the student that nervous diseases of the Ear should be divided into two classes -- to the first of which belong those cases where the special nervous apparatus of the organ is alone affected; the second, to those where the brain, conjointly with the Ear, seems to be injured. The first class may be subdivided into diseases arising from1. CONCUSSION.2. APPLICATION OF COLD.3. VARIOUS POISONS: as that of typhus, scarlet or rheumatic fevers; of measles and mumps; of gout; of an accumulation of bile in the blood, and of quinine in large doses.And the second into diseases arising from1. EXCESS OF MENTAL EXCITEMENT.2. PHYSICAL DEBILITY.DISEASES IN WHICH THE EAR ALONE IS AFFECTED.This division will be examined, with a review of the various kinds of diseases comprehended under the first of the above classifications, all of which are more or less accompanied by more or less congestion.DEBILITY OF THE NERVOUS APPARATUS OF THE EAR PRODUCED BY CONCUSSION.Concussion may arise from three different causes: either from a violent blow on the ear, from the effect of very loud sounds suddenly and unexpectedly introduced, or from a shock or jar of the entire system.Affections of the NERVOUS APPARATUS of the Ear, as resulting from blows on the EXTERNAL ORGAN, are not very common, because, as a general rule, the membrana tympani gives way -- that is to say, it ruptures, and, as a natural consequence, the sudden shock is so far modified in its effects on the ossicles and the fenestra avalis, that the contents of the labyrinth receive no greater injury than that which cause dullness of Hearing at times, as well as singing noises in the head.Before describing any treatment to be pursued, I would urgently recommend to all sufferers from partial deafness to write down the conversation or reading of another person. It will decidedly assist the treatment of restoration to Hearing. Such a practice is better than merely listening, because it requires a more than ordinary degree of attention to bring the hand in obedience to the ear. Next to this should be the habit of listening carefully, for a few hours daily, to a person reading aloud. Remarks of this kind are very valuable to the Deaf. It is singular, therefore, that the idea should hitherto only have been noticed by writers on Aural Surgery in the most casual manner, if, indeed, we ran say it has been mentioned at all.As a greater stimulus to encourage persons suffering from deafness to habits of greater attention, we may remark that nothing can be more painful to them than the gradual and final loss, one by one, of all the most familiar and pleasing sounds of nature. As the Hearing becomes gradually more feeble, the pattering of the rain, the rustling of the wind amongst the trees, the songs of birds, and the buzzing of insects, become more indistinct, or are altogether lost.To a deaf person the air is always heavy and silent, and the earth as monotonously dull as all sounds are to the healthy hearing amid the falling of snow. If the Deafness be accompanied by tinnitus, as is often the case, the external silence is mocked by the continuous and tiresome noises produced by disease itself within the organ of Hearing."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/03/archives/surgical-and-practical-observations-on-the-diseases-of-the-ear-with.html", "headline": "SURGICAL AND PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS; ON THE DISEASES OF THE EAR, WITH THE NEW MODE OF TREATING DEAFNESS TO WHICH IS ADDED AN APPENDIX, Containing a Treatise on Catarrh and the New System of Treating it.", "date": "1863-10-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 3, 1863,  Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The conjunction, that part of the eye which is the seat of some of its most important diseases, is a mucous membrane situated at the peripheral surface of the eye-ball. In the ear, some of the most common causes of the derangement of its functions depend, in like manner, on the morbid condition of a mucous membrane -- that lining the cavity of the tympanum, which, being situated at the peripheral surface of the labyrinth, the essential part of the apparatus of Hearing, bears exactly the same anatomical relation to it as the conjunctiva does to the eye-ball. The nasal duct, a mucous canal, is the seat of some frequent and exceedingly troublesome affections of the eye.The Eustachian tube, which resembles the nasal duct in every particular, does so also in a remarkable degree in its pathological states. We can give more explanatory facts of the similarity between the construction as well as the diseases of the eye and ear, but this is sufficient to illustrate its truthfulness. But it must be borne in mind, however similar it may be, that, in consequence of the difference of conditions requisite for the exercise of the normal functions of the two organs, the same elementary form of disease will have a widely different effect on Vision and Hearing. For example: inflammation and obstruction of the nasal duct has not such a direct effect on the exercise of the functions of the eye, as the same state of the Eustachian tube has on that of the ear.In the case of the Eye, we can readily and conveniently remove any accumulation of thickened mucous by the means of a sponge dipped in a simple solution; but the more inaccessible cavity of the tympanum requires to be cleared out by more complicated and judicious means, such as of applying my own Inhalator for this purpose, so as to allow free space for regurgitation of the air, both where the catheter is inserted into the mouth of the Eustachian tube, and where the nozzle of the tube of my Ear Inhalator is inserted into the dilated end of the catheter.But, as in catarrhal Opthalmia, for instance, it is not enough to clear away the discharge from the Eye, but also necessary to make some local application to the conjunctiva, if not to employ some general remedy, so must we medicate the membrane lining the cavity of the tympanum, at least, if we do not think it necessary to adopt any more general treatment after the accumulated mucus has been removed by my Ear Inhalator; or in the event of no accumulation existing, there may still be a morbid state of the membrane lining the cavity of the tympanum, admitting of being as beneficially acted upon by some local stimulating application as the conjunctiva in chronic conjunctivitis.It is, indeed, a very simple process to put a drop of liquid into the eye, as well as to clear away a discharge from the same organ; but in the case of the Ear it is totally different, being a complicated proceeding to apply a remedy directly to the membrane lining the cavity of the tympanum, so as to disperse accumulated mucus. Fluid injections are inconvenient in their applications; moreover, they produce a great deal of pain. The vapor of Acetic Ether, being easily injected, and exciting no pain beyond a little stinging sensation, will, in my opinion, be found the best adapted.According to Dr. KRAMER's theory, ethereal vapor is considered by this distinguished aurist, from his own experience, to benefit nervous deafness; but I believe some change in the membrane lining the tympanum will be found a more likely cause of the symptoms than any affections of the auditory nerves, as well as the more likely condition to be benefited by the contact of the vapors of Acetic Ether, the same principles that guide us in the employment of general treatment in diseases of the Eye guiding us in diseases of the Ear.The following is KRAMER's calculation of the cures performed by means of Ether, (for which purpose I was happy enough to succeed in inventing my Ethereal Ear Inhalator for the perfect restoration of hearing:)TABULAR VIEW OF THE FREQUENCY AND DURABILITY OF DISEASES OF THE EAR.\"Out of three hundred cases of diseases of the Ear of all kinds, two hundred, in round numbers, have not only been benefited but perfectly cured by the inhalation of Acetic Ether. Thirty have only improved their Hearing. About fifty have been benefited and relieved of the noises in the head by the vapors of Acetic Ether, the treatment having continued for months. The remainder were considered as incurable from the first, and they consequently remained rebellious to the treatment.\"HALLER proposed to effect the discharge of fluid infused into the cavity of the tympanum by forcing vapors into the Eustachian tubes. This proceeding was to fill the mouth with the vapors, close the lips and nose, and then make a long, forced exspiration, by which the vapor is driven through the Eustachian tubes into the tympanum. DELONU remarks that it is surprising that blowing air artificially into the tympanum, in Deafness, was not thought of sooner. ARCHIBALD CLELAND spoke of blowing air into the tympanum a hundred years ago.When the Hearing is improved by merely forcing air through the Eustachian tubes into the tympanum cavities, it is in general a sign promising advantage from the application of my Ethereal Ear Inhalator, resulting in a complete cure. In recent cases of muculent obstruction of the tympanic cavities with obstruction of the Eustachian tubes, considerable improvement has been experienced. One of my numerous patients, Mr. M., one of the first citizens of New-York, was so successfully treated by us that the Hearing distance on the right side was raised to four fee nine inches, and on the left side to seven feet seven inches. But this depends not only on the disease of the Ear from which the patient suffers, but a great deal also on the constitution; therefore, after examination of the Ear, it is always necessary to hear the statement of the patient. I invariably make my patient fill out a printed form. From this detail of his symptoms I can generally form an accurate diagnosis; for there may be constitutional derangements which attend upon the Ear. I have frequently observed that when it arises from sympathy, it is ushered in by a train of symptoms peculiar to itself. The flatulence, heartburn, and the dyspeptic signs, are of a very marked character, more especially in those individuals who once have had a paroxysm.The febrile state, too, is one of a high degree of irritation, of which the mind partakes as well as the body. I have found in Otitis that the patient suffers excruciating pain during the night, but there is not that singular sensation, which has been so admirably described by SYDENHAM, of utter impossibility of finding a position that is a relief from pain. That great physician was himself a martyr to Otitis, and if he had during the paroxysm minuted down each varying sensation as it arose, he could not more accurately have described this disease (Otitis) as it presents itself under ordinary circumstances, and in the greater number of cases in which it affects individuals. It not unfrequently occurs that, although during a very long period the sufferer from Otitis has never felt any uneasiness about it, yet from some unexplained cause, or more probably from a cold, suddenly exhibits its power of diminishing the Hearing as well as the comforts of life. First, a buzzing noise in the head, a sense of heat, tingling and of shooting, is perceptible, and then gradual inconvenience and diminution of the Hearing power, twitching, and even severe pains are felt. Under such circumstances, I find that it is generally believed that there is more difficulty in effecting a cure than where it had been perceived at an earlier stage, and had met with that attention which every disordered state of the Ear most particularly requires; but my own experience tells me, however late the individual seeks relief, that it may be given, if my own plan of treatment for recovering the Hearing is followed.Each organ of the body, when inflamed, or which show more or less of the general signs of inflammation, manifest certain symptoms which are peculiar to itself. Thus, intolerance of acute sound is a special symptom afforded by the Ear, and bears a similar relation to the functions of this organ as difficulty of breathing does to the lungs, or delirium to the brain. Even such special symptoms, however, are modified according to the particular texture of the part of the Ear which is inflamed.There are other circumstances beside the differences in the various parts of this most complicated little organ, which modify the inflammatory affections of the Ear, rendering also this subject very extensive in the discussion, and causing the diseases to be occasionally very perplexing in the treatment. They are under the influence of peculiarities of constitution and of constitutional diseases, and are subjected to numerous variations from the influence of sympathies. SCROFULA, SYPHILIS and GOUT are each of them capable of exciting inflammation in different parts of the Meatus Auditorius Internus, or of communicating to an inflammation excited by other causes such differences in character as often to render it difficult to recognize a disease with which we are well acquainted in its simple or idiopathic form.The general rule established by pathological observations of every part of the body, that inflammation in a great measure limits itself not merely to one organ, but even to one tissue, certainly holds with regard to the Ear. As we have Bronchitis, Pneumonia and Pleuritis, designating inflammation of the various tissues of the lungs -- as we meet with inflammation of the Peritoneum of the proper substance of the bowels and of their lining membrane, so we find the different parts of the Ear separately affected, (which parts I have simply in unadorned language described,) obliging us to recognize each part as an individual disease.By the influence of local sympathy, however, inflammation of one part of the ear never takes place without extending in some degree to the parts with which that first affected is in contact. By the same influence, inflammation originating in one part of the ear is communicated to several of the other parts, the disease of the meatus auditorius externus being communicated to those portions of the organ which are more deeply seated, and conversely that of the internal parts spreading outwards; and while each part obeys its own laws of morbid action, the whole organ in this way may become involved by what had at first a very limited existence, and perhaps a very trivial aspect.When we reflect, then, on the innumerable combinations which may take place among the inflammatory diseases of the ear, and the many causes by which these diseases may be modified, we shall be convinced, I think, that of all the subjects requiring descriptions and explanations of morbid action and changes, there can be few more difficult than those diseases which have been swept together with so indiscriminating a hand, under the name of Otitis. Unless this be kept in mind by those who begin to study inflammatory diseases of the ear, they will be not a little perplexed by the diversified complexions of morbid phenomena which they will meet at every step of their progress. A knowledge of the inflammatory diseases of the ear has been greatly retarded by the practice of confounding them all under the general name of Otitis, and thus overlooking both the seat of the disease and the peculiar nature of the inflammation."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/16/archives/newyork-deaf-and-dumb-institution.html", "headline": "New-York Deaf and Dumb Institution.", "date": "1863-05-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 16, 1863,  Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The exercises commenced at 4 o'clock by Rev. Dr. ADAMS, who opened with prayer, after which, Mr. PEAT, the Vice-Principal, went through with the examination to the great satisfaction of the audience.Several appropriate pieces of extemporary composition were written by the pupils, both male and female, which elicited the marked approval of the audience. During the examination several questions, such as \"What is the Soul?\" \"What is Religion?\" \"What is Faith?\" \"What is Love?\" &c., were put from the audience, and were clearly and most satisfactorily expounded.The metaphorical examination attracted the great interest with all present.Mr. BENEDICT, the deaf and dumb Tutor, showed great proficiency in his education of the youthful portion of the institution, and the performance of \"Old Mother Hubbard,\" was a truthful index of this fact, and drew from those assembled loud applause.One of the most interesting features of the performance was the dialogue between a deaf mute brother and his sister, who were in mourning on account of their mother and two sisters, who, as Mr. PEAT feelingly said, were members of the institution, but had gone to heaven. This rehearsal elicited the most profound attention, and its conclusion was the signal for an outburst of applause.The whole proceedings terminated at six o'clock by singing and pronouncing the benediction."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/24/archives/deafness-its-causes-and-prevention.html", "headline": "DEAFNESS ITS CAUSES AND PREVENTION.", "date": "1862-05-24T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 24, 1862,  Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

A number of the pupils, under the direction of the Messrs. PEET, exhibited the proficiency they have attained in the institution. Of the 310 pupils in the institution, there were 42 present -- one class of eight years' standing, and the other of eight months. BENJAMIN R. WINTHROP, Esq., one of the Directors, presided, and Dr. HARVEY P. PEET, the Superintendent, prefaced the exercises with a brief address.The various proficiencies of the pupils were then exhibited seriatim. Some of the smaller boys gave illustrations of hope, fear, anger, hate, learning, apprehension, listening, &c., in the sign language. Three of the boys gave an exhibition in concert, [???] up with a representation of soldiers and firing [???]. Miss M.C. GOODRICH and several other of the female pupils gave readings of poetical compositions. Four of the highest class, Misses IDA MONTGOMERY and EUNICE BARKER, and WILLIAM HUBHARD and DAVID R. TILLINGHAST underwent a severe ordeal at the blackboard. They were called upon to write their names, to define and illustrate syllogisms, to give their opinions of war, patriotism, high treason, secession and of our Generals. They all wrote impromptu compositions on the topics suggested, full of literary excellence, as well as of profound thought. They were all well read in the current topics of the day, as well as upon historical and literary subjects. The proficiency of all the pupils was a subject of general praise, and the entire exhibition drew forth the most enthusiastic applause from the audience.Among those on the platform were Dr. ADAMS, P.M. WETMORE, CYRUS W. FIELD and others, who take a deep interest in the institution, and are connected with its management.

One of the most interesting objects of the exhibition is a photographic album made up of likenesses and autographs of noted men connected with our Government. The President has contributed his own and his wife's physiognomy and specimens of their penmanship.\"Our Jessie\"is also represented in graceful simplicity of attitude and toilet, while the beautiful ADA DOUGLAS finishes the list. This exquisitely bound volume is to be raffled off for $250 at $1 a chance. A Japanese quilt, or rather spread, is made of two thicknesses of china silk, and embroidered with a richness rarely to be met in the finest crape shawls.Union portfolios in checkered ribbon of red, white and blue, and finished with pockets of cherry-colored silk, are a novelty combining use and beauty.The grand centre of attraction in the hall is the stand designated by the title \"St. Ann,\" in letters of evergreen. Above it is canopied the large, rich banner, of the City Guard, which has been loaned for the occasion. At the back of the stall droops in wealth of rich design and soft fabric, a carriage Afghan, which is to be raffled for at the close of the Fair.

PETER STRYKER, is increasing rapidly, thirty-five having joined its fold last Sabbath.Forty flags lent a highly patriotic air to the exhibition. One alone, sent from the Arsenal, hung its massive festoons along one entire side of the room. No raffling was permissible, and much of the success is due to the felicitous auctioneering of Mr. W.T. BOYD, who, with an appropriate argument setting forth the admirable qualities of each article that fell to his custody, was left with only one regret, which was participated in by all his associates, viz., that no \"more were left of the same sort,\" and the sale closed perforce.The principal interest of this mission lies in the amelioration of the condition of the poor in the eastern part of the City, where a much-neglected field offers for their labors.The congregation have shown themselves particularly generous in donations this year, and even little children have been aroused to assist, so that they might preside over tables laden, with their own and their little friends' handiwork.On all sides do encouraging results develop themselves, and the proceeds of the present fair are likely to exceed $700, which was the sum netted last year.The ladies of the mission have a Visitor permanently established, who spends his whole time in searching the lanes and by-ways of the locality, in search of objects for deliverance from infamy and vice.Their little church is entirely relieved of debt, except a mortgage upon the ground, which they are aboring, by means of fairs and donations, to pay off.Raffling is not admitted as a means of ehancinng prices, and, therefore, many rare and beautiful articles are sold at less than their value. Among these are three unusually fine specimens of Potochimanie, vases, over three feet high. An original feature of this fair is the appealing figure of a widow in gloomiest weeds, holding forth a little basket for the patrons of the Widows Fund to fill with small coin. The young lady in attendance at this table has the widow's basket to empty very often into the larger receptacle concealed in the mysterious nook to which she lends her graceful presence. Objects combining amusement with elevating instruction are noticeable upon most of the tables, the most impressive arrangement of the kind being a crucifix, upon which is represented the Divine attributes of Our Saviour in a way calculated to attract the attention of Sunday-school scholars.A \"Folly Doll\" is conspicuous in a dress of points, cut from rich silk and lace, each point being finished with agold (supposed to be) bell; the royal toss, lofty hat, exquisite silk stockings and slippers -- all, in one way or another, are expressive of clap-trap and folly. This, too, is a lesson suited albeit, to riper intellects."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1861/10/13/archives/church-for-deaf-mutes.html", "headline": "Church for Deaf Mutes.", "date": "1861-10-13T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 13, 1861,  Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

A discourse was preached by the Hector, the Rev. THOMAS GALLAUDET, setting forth the following statistics: Families 86, (15 whose heads are deaf mutes;) individuals about 700, (150 deaf mutes;) baptisms, adults 23. (2 deaf mutes;) infants 27, (1 of deaf mutes;) total, 50. Confirmed 57, (6 deaf mutes;) marriages 14 (2 of deaf mutes:) 26 burial, (1 deaf mute, and 2 children of deaf mutes.) The income of S. Ann's Church for the year was, offerings $5,299 26; donations from friends mostly outside of the parish, $5.156 03; from Trinity Church, $300; other sources, $31 35; total, $10.786 64. Could this church at once receive about $4.000 it would be in a self-sustaining position. The general scope of the sermon, with its affecting incidents, showed that much had been accomplished in the way of improving the condition of deaf mutes in temporal as well as spiritual matters, and that this parish should be sustained in its interesting mission by the church at large."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1861/09/27/archives/st-anns-church-for-deaf-mutes-the-fallacy-of-state-sovereignty.html", "headline": "ST.

Dr. VINTON delivered a very argumentative discourse last evening at St. Ann's Church, inEighteenth-street, in which he argued, and so far as sound argument will do it, he demonstrated most conclusively, that the doctrine maintained by the South, that the people of a State owed to it a duty paramount to that which the National Government imposed was erroneous. The State Rights' doctrine, was discussed at length, and the fallacy of CALHOUN's nullification doctniue exhibited in a light not at all flattering to the wisdom of the South Carolina statesman. The Doctor attacked the favoriteargument of the cSeeders, which he stated to be, that in as much as each State, separately and for itself, adopted the Federal Constitution, therefore it had an undoubted right to secede whenever it saw fit, it being its own judge of the sufficiency of the causes which impelled it to the separation. The speaker claimed that the sixth article of the United States Constitution necessarily extinguished the State's sovereignty, and made it of paramount obligation upon the citizen's of all the States. He was listened to with great attention throughout, by a very large audience."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/10/archives/the-institution-for-the-deaf-and-dumb.html", "headline": "THE INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB.", "date": "1861-05-10T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 10, 1861,  Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

On the platform, the young ladies of the Institution were arranged on elevated seats, dressed in white muslin, with bright sashes and other adornments, such as Union rosettes, and scarfs. With the exception of six or eights boys, who had to take part in the exercises, the male members of the Institution were placed in the rear gallery. Most of the officers and Directors of the Institution were present. Dr. PEET introduced Rev. Dr. STONE, who, after briefly welcoming the audience, opened the proceedings with prayer. Dr. PEET then stated that there were just 300 pupils in the Institution, very nearly all of whom where present. They were divided into 16 classes, each under a distinct teacher. Representatives of only two of those classes would be presented to the meeting. Two girls and two boys, of the latest class, those who entered the Institution in September last, being at that time ignorant that ideas could be conveyed by words and the class of highest attainment, consisting of those who had been eight and nine years under instruction. The former class were first exhibited, and went through their exercises on the slate in the most creditable manner. Two young ladies and two youths of the highest class were then introduced, and manifested a proficiently that astonished and delighted the spectators. Illustration of the manual language, the sign language and the blachial alphabet for conversing at a distance were given, and some very amusing numetic interludes convulsed all the beholders. But the feature of the occasion was, as usual at these Anniversaries, the competition of impromtu themes on the slates by pupils of the higher grade, and the most noticeable of these were those in which the present condition of the country was made the theme of comment. The Deaf and Dumb read the newspars daily, and are, as they proved themselves yesterday, highly patriotic. Washington, Harper's Ferry, Baltimore, Gen. SCOTT, Major ANDERSON, Fort Sumter, are topics of as immediate and exciting interest to them as to those who listened to the reading (by Dr. PEET) of their compositions with eagerness. Miss MARY L. GOODRICH, of Brooklyn, a remarkably beautiful young lady, manipulated a poem, in the Sikh language, with considerable effect; while Miss FANNY L. FREEMAN, of Allahabad. Northern India, whose parents were killed by the Sepoys in the last Indian war, fairly \"took down the house\" by her admirable rendering of the poem \"When Freedom from her mountain heights.\" The proceedings terminated with the Lord's Prayer, in the Sikh language, by Miss FANNY WALTER, and a benediction by Rev. Dr. ADAMS."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/03/archives/local-military-movements-call-of-col-asboth-upon-the-hungarians-in.html", "headline": "LOCAL MILITARY MOVEMENTS.; CALL OF COL.

KOSSUTH, our Chief, with others of us now here, were detained by the Sultan in Asia Minor, the generous intervention of the United States set us free, and the national steam-frigate Mississippi, under the glorious flag of Stars and Stripes, brought us safely from a gloomy prison to the free shores of America.The sympathy and assistance thus bestowed upon down-trodden Hungary and its scattered exiled sous imbued me with a feeling of everlasting gratitude, and ten years of citizenship of this Republic, by virtue of which I have enjoyed the blessings of its institutions, render me doubly impressed with all its duties and obligations, as deeply and as earnestly as if I were native of the soil.Thus actuated, I have already offered my military services to the Government. Many of you have done the same, and I feel confident that you all share my sense of indebtedness to the United States, and would feel equally gratified with myself in attesting it by substantial service.You all know the value of the Union as it was, and will stand by it faithful and true, and defend it at all hazards, with that same firmness and gallantry displayed so emphatically in the defence of your own native land, the rights and Constitution of Hungary. To embody these sentiments in a practical form, we Hungarians in New-York and its vicinity must meet, conter, unite and organize.I therefore request you to assemble to-morrow (Saturday) at 7 1/2 o'clock P.M., at the Astor House, Col. STETSON, the proprietor, having kindly offered one of his parlors for our use. The number of the room will be given at the office of the Astor Home.A. ASBOTH.The Regiment of Infantry which Col. VON STEINWEHR is organizing for service in behalf of the United States Government, numbers at present three hundred and seventy enlisted men. Many of these are from the country, and depend for their support upon immediate assistance. Mr. G.M. MCLEAN, of the Citizens' Insurance Company, No. 67 Wall-street, has kindly consented to receive subscriptions. The officers of the regiment have all received a military education in schools corresponding to our West Point Academy. They are: Von Steinwehr, formerly of the Brunswick service; Seidel, formerly of the Holstein service; Von Sternburg, formerly of the Austrian service; Urnan, formerly of the Austrian service; Schulz, formerly of the Austrian service; Von Fronvois, formerly of the Prussian service; Von Nostitz, formerly of the Prussian service; Herzog, formerly of the Prussian service; Von Zachuschen, formerly of the Prussian service; Weinhold, formerly of the Holstein service; Sas, formerly of the Brunswick service.At the meeting of the Joint Special Committee of the Common Council, yesterday afternoon, the Chairman reported that the Sub-Committee on \"Aid to Regiments\" of the Union Defence Committee were willing to give $500 to and provide rooms for each unorganized regiment desiring quarters and rations, and afford further aid as needed. As the Government are not speedily calling the volunteer regiments into service, it is deemed best to be cautious in undertaking their support, lest the million loan may run out too fast. The Sub-Committee of the U.D.C. on \"Aid to Families,\" had adopted a plan to go into effect next Monday -- that of each Alderman hearing and acting upon applications, aided by two citizens of his district. These things were satisfactory to the Common Council Committee, and they adjourned till four o'clock on Monday.The Montezuma Regiment of this City, commanded by Col. WILLIAM H. BROWNE, formerly of the Mexican War, has been accepted by the Government. Some of the corps have already been inspected and quartered. The patriotic are invited to contribute funds, or other necessaries for immediate use, and to deliver the same to Hon. JOHN W. EDWARDS, No. 111 Broadway, (Trinity Buildings,) to Hon. FREDERICK A. CONKLING, M.C., to STEWART L. WOODFORD, Esq., No. 16 Wall-street and U.S. Court Building, Adjutant ORLANDO L. STEWART, No. 16 Wall-street, or to Col. W.H. BROWNE, No. 84 Nassau-st.The Committee of Twenty-five sit in perpetual session at the Astor House, Room No. 41. Over 10,000 men have already joined the organization, and more are steadily pouring in, Hon. HANNIBAL HANLIN was prevented yesterday visiting this Committee, but will do so this morning at 10 o'clock. Senator FOOTE, of Vermont, and Gov. STANTON, of Kansas, will also be present. The various Ward Committees are requested to attend.Hon. DANIEL SICKLES visited the drill-room of this regiment and addressed the men in a patriotic speech. Three cheers were given for the Star Spangled Banner and three for the Queen of England. Lieut.-Col. TORRES, late of Her Britannic Majesty's Seventeenth Foot, who has seen active service in the Crimea, is at present in command of this regiment. Donations in any shape or form will be very acceptable to this regiment.The ex-members of this Regiment have formed an association to be known as the \"Home Guard of the Eighth Regiment, Washington Grays.\" Their object is to take charge of the Armory during the absence of the Regiment, and perfect themselves by drill to perform any duty that may be required in aid of the civic authorities.This, the Seventy-ninth Regiment, will not at present leave the City. Many of the men who volunteered have already left; those who wish it are transferred by their Captain to other regiments. All who remain will have their uniform presented to them free of expense. A dress parade will take place at the State Arsenal, Thirty fifth-street, next week.The drill-room of this regiment will be after to-day at the Austach Theatre, corner of Fourth-street and Avenue A. Col. UTASSY has nearly 600 able-bodied, active men enrolled. The uniform of this regiment will be of the most practical description, being made up from the Hungarian, French and Italian military costume.A regimental parade of the Empire City Guard took place last evening. They made a fine appearance as they marched down Broadway, preceded by Dodworth's Band. Mr. ANDREW SHEEHAN is the Acting-Colonel, and Mr. WM. MULLIGAN is the Acting Lieutenant-Colonel. They are at present 600 strong.This fine body of men, who were detached to bring the ship Constitution to this port, paraded yesterday, and went through many evolutions in the Park. The accuracy with which the most intricate manoeuvers were executed elicited loud applause. They were all done with the precision of clock-work.Major ANDERSON, yesterday, visited the Home for Young Deaf Mutes. He was received by Rev. THOMAS GALLAUDET, the Chaplain, and Mrs. DEVOE, the lady in charge of the Institution. It is difficult to say which derived most pleasure from the visit -- the children or the Major.The report that this Regiment, now quartered at Staten Island, are in a state of insubordination, and that they have had trouble with Col. ALLEN's command, is totally unfounded. They are in a complete state of subordination, and obey their officers in all things.This Regiment marched down Broadway to the Battery in order to encamp there, and to relieve the Lafayette Guard, who were already quartered there.Lieut.-Col. FARNSWORTH, who has been at Albany for the last few days, returned last evening with the news that the Regiment was accepted, and was to be mustered into service immediately. Col. WARD is in command of the Regiment.Col. DURYEA's command are still at Fort Schuyler, and are being drilled and equipped most rapidly. There has been a report that the men are not well fed. This the men themselves emphaticall, deny, stating that it is impossible for better rations to be served them.The Twentieth Regiment, Col. G.W. PRATT, is still quartered at the barracks in the Park. They are being armed and equipped as rapidly as possible, and will be in full marching order in a few days.Colonel, the Hon. DANIEL E. SICKLES, has already enrolled 700 men for this regiment. It is expected that they will be mustered into service to-morrow. The barracks are at No. 444 Broadway.Col. MCCHESNEY's command go into encampment to-day, at Hamilton-square, corner of Sixty-sixth-street and Fifth-avenue.The students of the University raise a national flag to-day, at 10 1/2 o'clock. The exercises will take place in the large chapel of the University.Judge EDMONDS will lecture to Spiritualists and others, at Dodworth's Hall, No. 806 Broadway, on Sunday, at 10 1/2 A.M. and 7 1/2 P.M."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/17/archives/police-reports-a-detective-badly-beaten-a-deaf-and-dumb-burglar-an.html", "headline": "Police Reports.; A DETECTIVE BADLY BEATEN.

Bennett arrested one of them, who gave the name of Thomas Neely, and McDougall entered upon a cross-examination of the other. Finding these interrogatories of too searching a character, McDougall's man, who held the soap, dropped it and ran into an alley in Eighth-street, the officer following him closely. As soon, however, as the latter entered the alley, he was assaulted by some person unknown, in so severe a manner as to make him for a few moments insensible. When he recovered himself, his assailants had escaped as well as the man whom he had pursued. It was subsequently ascertained that the soap had been stolen from Claus Fink, corner of Sixth-avenue and Eleventh-street, and Neely was committed by Justice QUACKENBUSH to answer for the theft.The attention of Officer Lynch, of the Sixteenth Ward, was attracted about 1 o'clock yesterday morning to the flour store of Beyer & Birdsall, corner of Seventeenth-street and Sixth-avenue, by the noise of some one hammering within. He awoke Mr. Beyer, who sleeps in the building, and together they entered the store, where they found a young fellow skulking behind some barrels. He was taken into custody, when it transpired that he was a deaf-mute, named William Hunt. In his possession were found skeleton keys and an assortment of burglar's tools, consequently Justice QUACKENBUSH fully committed him for trial. It is supposed that the accused had accomplices in the burglary.Prof. Samuel W. Downing, whose arrest on a charge of having defrauded a large number of young women of $5 each, has been made public, was yesterday set at liberty by Justice BRENNAN. Downing stated that he had not the slightest idea of doing his pupils injustice by leaving the City, having absented himself because of an unexpected call to Boston which could not be neglected. He added that he was now prepared to carry out his contract with the fair complainants, to whom he apologized for the trouble he had occasioned them, and they, deeming his explanations satisfactory, withdrew the complaint.Warren Banning, a young man, who served as poll-clerk at one of the Twentieth Ward districts during the recent election, was apprehended on Thursday night by Officer IRVING, of the Twentieth Ward, on a charge of having passed counterfeit money. The prisoner had visited the drinking-places Nos. 396 and 388 Eighth-avenue, in each of which he palmed off a worthless bill, representing the $3 issue of the Bank of the Interior, Albany, N.Y. In default of $1,000 bail Justice QUACKENBUSH committed him to prison for trial.James H. Bailey, a young man engaged as cashier at the Greene-street establishment of E. Phalon & Son, was yesterday committed by Justice QUACKENBUSH for examination, on a charge of having embezzled about $300 from his employers. The alleged peculations are said to have been going on for some time past, but they were perpetrated in so adroit a way that the accused was not suspected of dishonesty until yesterday.On Thursday night a man named Sebastian Tanner broke open a room on the second floor of the dwelling-house No. 44 Willet-street, and was about entering the room for unlawful purposes. The rogue's designs were frustrated, however, by Mrs. Maria Clarke, the occupant, who collared him and held him despite his struggles, until her call for aid had been answered by Officer Collard, of the Thirteenth Ward, who conducted him to the Police Station. Yesterday, Justice BRENNAN committed the prisoner for a hearing."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1860/10/13/archives/the-prince-in-the-metropolis-grand-ball-at-the-academy-of-music.html", "headline": "THE PRINCE IN THE METROPOLIS.; Grand Ball at the Academy of Music.

It was preceded, however, last night, by a very splendid, crowded, gorgeous and glittering levee, which may well take rank with the most magnificent \"jams\" of history. In the days of our grandmothers, who used to have their hair dressed two days in advance of one of these festivities, and sit holt upright in powder for forty-eight hours, it was regarded as the height of fashion and the supreme of bliss, to fill a house so full with embroidered beaux and belles that they stood upon one another's silken toes in the passages and stairways. Of our own days it may hereafter be said that the finest thing which \"four hundred select committee men\" of New-York could do to entertain the Prince of Wales, was to invite to the Academy of Music exactly five hundred people more than the house would hold, amuse them by opening a pitfall in the floor, and crush their toilettes into one undistinguishable mass of splendor.The Ball at the Academy was everything but a Ball. The arrangements of the external and internal police, though occasionally irritating to impetuous beauties, impatient of supper, were most exemplary. The wealth of flowers lavished upon corridors, galleries, box-fronts and doorways was tropical for variety of hue, and Arabian for odors of beatitude. All that music could do to enchant an aromatic atmosphere with melody, the most superb hands procurable in America abundantly did. The Prince of Wales, who apparently has Queen ELIZABETH's passion for dancing, made his entree punctually at 10 o'clock, armed and equipped as the Committee had kindly directed, in \"full evening dress,\" with all the noblemen and gentlemen of his suite. The stately Mrs. MORGAN, in a cloud of crape alive with diamonds, was at her post, prepared to open the ball as became the queen regnant of the Empire State, with the young heir of England. And yet at midnight the ball had not begun. \"Some one had blundered,\" precisely as some one blundered on the Reception Day of Thursday, and last night, as then, this same one's blunder cheated the Prince of half his pleasure and dashed the festival for all with a tinge of mingled mirth and vexation. All that we had heard of the elaborate and costly preparations made by the Committee, since they began their work in August last, seemed fully borne out by the first aspect of the Academy when we entered it. Just before the arrival of the Prince, the parquette, floored over from lobby to stage, draped, beset with exotics the richest and most fragrant, was rather a parterre than a parquette -- a parterre of living flowers, rustling, fluttering, gleaming with bright eyes and brighter jewels. The boxes and galleries climbed, tier above tier, into a grand tiara of the same animated beauty, crested and glowing with lines of the most brilliant light. Never has the Opera House presented a spectacle so sumptuous at once and so exquisite as at the moment of the Prince's entrance upon the stage, to the persuasive strains of \"God Save the Queen.\" But here began the miscarriages of the night. The \ufffddais\" on which the Prince was to have presented himself was no dais at all, and he was consequently just as visible to the whole mass of the people on the floor, who surged and swayed to and fro in a kind of well-bred impatience in their eagerness to see him, as if he had been Leander in the play. Indeed, but for the national air of England, few out of the upper boxes could have suspected his presence within the sacred space rather foolishly railed off for his accommodation. A kind of frantic promenade, eddying both ways, then began to defile, or rather to entwine itself before the hero of the evening, as a preparation for the opening Strauss quadrille of the Haute Volee. A more perplexing promenade was never perhaps performed by an enthusiastic and well-dressed multitude, but before it had half developed its attractions, it was suddenly interrupted by a stupendous crash. A momentary thrill ran through the crowd, and a panic might perhaps have ensued with the most appalling consequences, had not a few gentleman the vicinity of the Prince, conspicuous among whom was Ex-Gov. FISH, rushed forward to reassure the house. In fact nothing had happened but the falling in of a large portion of the floor in the \"reserved quarter,\" and directly front of the Prince had BOOLE and VAN TINE been at the bottom of the ball, this would have looked like a parody on Guy Faux. As it was, people simply stared and stammered out their surprise. Before they could recover from the shock they were saluted with a second. This made the matter serious. The Prince and his party retreated to the supper-rooms, the hands began to play all manner of waltzes, polkas and quadrilles in mad succession, the people began, to flow as best they might out from the perilous parquette into the corridors, and to find their way into the supper-room. Carpenters came on the scene, and a sort of modified anvil-chorus, not in the original opera, was set up in the heart of the ball. In this way two hours were consumed, the fine edge of the festivity pretty effectually taken off, and the Prince robbed of at least six dances. Only one good effect can be said to have followed from this contretemps. It killed the much debated \"first dance,\" over which our ladies have been, or have been made to appear, so elegantly unhappy. Nobody danced the first dance with the Prince; and who can be jealous of nobody? Perhaps, indeed, (let the wretched door-committee thank us for the suggestion,) it was a conspiracy of ladies who undermined the pillars.However, the fete -- call it by what name we may and find whatever fault with it we honestly must -- was an event, and is not to be forgotten. In the details of decoration and equipment, there was scarcely anything with which the most fastidious taste could quarrel. The supper-room, in particular, was a wonderful success. The crest of the Prince of Wales blazed out in plumes of diamond-like light over the floating folds of a vast tent of pink and white drapery, lined along one side with buffet-tables, singularly neat and brilliant in service, and really attended to by a regiment of most faithful and active waiters, marshaled under the orders of LORENZO DELMONICO, and perpetually supplying a regulated and orderly stream of admiring, but more or less appetized guests with all the delicacies which the house of DELMONICO so justly prides itself upon \"creating\" with the true artistic power. We may frankly say that we have never seen a public supper served in a more inapproachable fashion with greater discretion, or upon a more tastefully luxurious scale. The Supper Committee and DELMONICO may divide between themselves the honor of the occasion, and it is impossible to say what would have become of the whole \"ball\" during the interregnum of hammers and nails, but for the agreeable occupation which they furnished to the three thousand odd. How agreeable that occupation was, let the following bill of fare testify:BALLIN HONOR OFHIS ROYAL HIGHNES THE PRINCE OF WALES.NEW-YORK, Oct. 12, 1860.MENU.Consomme de Volaille.Huitres a la Poulette.Saumon.

Le Vase de Flora.Silver Fountain, etc., etc.DELMONICO.The opening fiasco of the evening was the more to be regretted, that the Prince and his party evidently arrived in the highest spirits. The Prince (who has a double in New-York, in the person of a young gentleman whose name we forbear to mention, lest he should be married by mistake) looked slightly pale and a little wan. His slight figure and low stature do not impress the beholder as exactly princely, but it does not need the blue ribbon of the Garter to make him out at a closer observation, as a person of the highest breeding and position. The quiet delicacy of his smile, the gentle and tranquil dignity which sits so lightly upon the natural freshness and the untamed spirits of his youth are the princeliest things about him, and are not to be mistaken.The Duke of Newcastle, who has played the mentor to our young Telemachus, stood as usual near the Prince, whose career through this country and Canada he has directed with so much wisdom and good taste. Within the last seven years time has touched the Duke slightly with her gray wing as she passed. The heavy beard he has worn since the Crimea, has given a strong, bold character to his face, too, and shorn it of that spirituality it wore when as Lord LINCOLN he stood for D'ISRAELI's \"Coningsby,\" and was the most promising of PEEL's lieutenants. Still he seems with his gallant presence and noble look every inch what he is, the purest and highest type of an English gentleman. Lord ST. GERMAN's made a capital contrast with the Duke; his smooth and courtier-like air balancing singularly well the rather deceive style of the Secretary for the Colonies, while his broad red ribbon of the Bath threw in upon the whole group, what the painters call a \"nice bit of color.\" The New-Yorkers of the Committee were much less truly representative, men in their appearance than the cortege of the Prince; but as we know what the ideal American is, we could bear this -- and the more easily that at one moment Gen. SCOTT, immediately after the first dance, gave us all a most striking vision of the American race as it ought to be. Pressed by the crowd he drew back toward the end of the stage, and with his queenly daughters, one on either arm, suddenly towered up on the dais in the sight of the whole ball. A momentary impulse of admiration ran through the crowd as the splendid trio rose into view, and the Prince himself was for the instant forgotten.THE BEGINNING OF THE BALL.A little after 12, the carpenters, though \"but half their weary task was done,\" were forced to surrender their platform to the opening dance. This was formed as quickly as the crowd and confusion would permit, and was a dance, certainly of some kind, in which the Prince of Wales appeared to dance with Mrs. MORGAN, and Lord LYONS with Miss WOOD. JOHN VAN BUREN and Miss BERRIMAN were in some way involved in the proceeding, and the charming Mrs. GARDNER HOWLAND, Jr., seemed to be delighting the eyes of the accomplished and handsome Mr. GERARD, who is now acknowledged, since his recent lecture on the personal beauty of ABRAHAM LINCOLN, to be the Crichton of New-York.How this saltation came to an end was not perfectly intelligible, but, the Prince and his suite suddenly vanishing, a waltz began, under the bewildering supervision of Mr. WALTER CUTTING, Mr. MANUSELL B. FIELD and Mr. WILLIAM DUNCAN. From the general appearance of things at this juncture, when we left the scene of action, we inferred that the ball had contrived at last to make head against its difficulties; and that in time the carpenters would be driven from the field. In fact, we believe they were absolutely retiring at that moment, under the command of the majestic Capt. LEONARD, of the police.THE TOILETTES OF THE BALL.A peculiar subject, to be ventured upon by any member of the sex of ACTAEON, and only to be successfully attempted by one who unites the audacity of the Roman CLODIUS with the experience of a BEAU NASH. We have no such pretensions, and must ask freedom in advance of our fair readers, for all and singular the technical blunders into which we may fall. As for omissions and shortcomings, we make no apology for them. So universal has good taste become among American ladies, at least in the matters of the more brilliant toilettes of society, that one can hardly go wrong in taking his examples as fate throws them in his way. Observe too the felicity of the reporter who has to deal who a ball exclusively made up of the salt of the earth, and with the most aristocratic of democratic companies. In Europe, the history of a ball and its toilettes is perforce, burdened with a host of \"inevitables.\" The social hierarchy must have its due honor and Dowager Marchionesses must be describe no matter at what expense to the lilies of the valley. Here where we are all sovereigns and sovereignesses, no such cruel law is imposed upon the scribe who writes simply that others may see with his eyes whatever passed before him worthy of report. It must be owned at once that our grand ball had any fault, it was an overflow of ripe loveliness. The busy fingers of the modistes throughout the metropolis must have been marvellously blackened during the past fortnight by working in velvet. A lady friend whispers to us that yonder magnificent ruin wied in Genoa green is but one of forty-six estimable dowagers for whom her own particular Einstein-Devy has been shaping regal robes, and that not one of the imposing cohort is absent from her post to-night. Multiplying forty-six by the number of milliners in New-York, whose names a lady of fashion need not blush to know, and you will probably come as near the total of dowager-dom here present to bless the comely son of a royal mother with their ample affection, us you would to the absolute amount of an Irish fortune on dividing its owner's estimate by six. Now, dahlias are certainly most respectable flowers, but rose-buds must be admitted to be pleasanter gathering; and a ball is, after all, or ought to be, only a human bouquet.Yet velvet and dowagers have this merit, that they imply diamonds, and the implication on this occasion was verified in fact. One might almost have fancied himself in St. Petersburg, for although a single Woronzoff, parure would have driven any particular dowager or dame before you quite mad with envy, yet the distribution of diamonds was so wide that glanced at from a distance, they made a most effective element in the coup d'oeil of the ball. One splendid riviere which recently astounded the city in the cases of TIFFANY was most charmingly displayed upon the graceful beauty of MRS. BELMONT, and shone afar even over the glittering crowd, from her place on the right of the stage, a quarter by the way, much affected during the troublous beginning of the fete by numerous fair ladies, partly perhaps from alarm and partly from its advantages as a capital setting to such lovely pictures.Diamonds aside, however, the exhibition of toilettes, of which even the crowd, the crushing and the crash, could not suppress the fresh, and crisp, and rustling beauty, was something marvellous. It was as if all the looms of the world had made a wager together to hold a grand fair in New-York. One only embarrassment, is in the task of selection, and so as we said before, we shan't select. There passes before us, as the names of the queens of the evening float up in our memory, such a caleidoscope of azure colors and cloudy laces, and gleaming jewels, that it seems idle to attach mortal names to such a phantasmagoria of brilliant effects. We have already spoken of Mrs. MORGAN and her diamonds, and of Mrs. BELMONT\ufffd and her diamonds. We might go on in the same way, with perfect truth, to speak of half the ladies of New-York and their diamonds. Diamonds went aside, for they were rather the rule than the exception of the evening. Mrs. ROBERT B. MINTURN contrived to throw them into the shade with a waving head-dress of ostrich feathers, altogether courtly and precious, without reference to its implied compliment to the Prince and his plume. Mrs. ASPINWALL was also notable in a glory of blue moire antique, powdered with jewels, and Mrs. GRINNELL, in black moire antique, decidedly declined the condition of a \"dowager.\" A delicate shade of mauve-color, flounced with laces, till they seemed a sort of frosted amethyst, and icicled over with glittering diamonds, varied the expanse of more familiar tints. Mrs. HAMILTON FISH, and the muse of the drama, in the person of Mrs. HOEY, of Wallack's Theatre, were conspicuous patronesses of this pleasing hue. But time fails us to dilate upon these matters. We resign them to other chroniclers, and the hall with them, since it did at fast become a ball, to the consolation of the desolate Committee, the pleasure of three thousand New-Yorkers, and the lasting glory of the hospitable emporium of the Western World.ORDER OF DANCING.1..Quadrille......Haute Volce............Strauss.2..Waltz..........Prince of Wales........Muzio.3..Lancers........National...............Noll.4..Galon.........Salute..................Michaelis.5..Quadrille......Frieschutz..............Weber.6..Polka..........Addie...................Muzio.7..Waltz..........Victoria................Lanber.8..Lancers........Royal Prince Guard....Noll.9..Galop.........Una Seomessa..........Muzio.10..Waltz..........Minot Klaenge.........Strauss.11..Lancers........Vis a Vis...............Rietzel.12..Polka.........Sylphide................Bilse.13..Galop.........Liederkranz............Noll.14..Quadrille......A la mode..............Strauss.15..Waltz..........Nach and Violen.......Lanner.16..Lancers........Les Guides.............Rietzel.17..Galop.........Fest....................Lambye.18..Polka.........Sans Souci.............Strauss.19..Lancers........Original................ _____20..Waltz..........Dream of the Ocean....Guugl.21..Galop.........Ernani.................Verdi.The Crown-jewel of Great Britain was to be displayed last night, set round with three or four thousand minor brilliants carefully selected by two hundred social lapidaries, who were under pledge to admit no stone having speck or flaw on its bright surface. To give appropriate setting to this rich cluster was the duty of the Committee of Arrangements appointed by the Ball Committee; and of the manner in which this trust was fulfilled, the following account of the ball-room, as it appeared last night, will give the public opportunity to judge.Two entrances to the Academy of Music were open last night, the entrance for guests being the regular opera-entrance on Irving-place, but garlanded with flags and guarded on all sides by platoons of locust-waving policemen. For the Prince of Wales a special private entrance was made along the sidewalk of Fourteenth-street, thus giving him prompt access to that end of the magnificent ball-room at which the Royal dais was erected.Entering through the door on Fourteenth-street, under a canopy formed of Union Jacks and Stars-pangled banners, the Prince and his suite were received in a long Hall of Entrance by the Reception Committee -- this hall being draped with silks, showing the red, white and blue in beautiful combination round the walls, a carpet of deep damask cloth covering the floor, English and American flags looped into the semblance of waving cornices round the ceilings, and just opposite the entrance a blazing crystal illustration of the Royal Arms of England, thrown out into dazzling brightness by the aid of silver reflectors.Passing up this hall, which was richly curtained with crimson satin at its far end, the Prince turned to his left into a smaller hall completely draped on all sides with dark purple cloth, only relieved by the flash of polished armor on its walls and the bright hues of two vast flower pyramids placed in china vases at its opposite corners. The effect of this small wine-colored Chamber with its flashing and many-branched gold chandelier was rich beyond description.Passing onward through this by a narrow and winding passage constructed behind the ball-room -- carpets, walls and ceiling of which were of the same dark crimson cloth -- the Prince of Wales was at length ushered into his parlor, a room gorgeously furnished in a style to correspond with previous decorations, the marble table in its centre sustaining another pyramid of exotic petals, and a full-length portrait of Queen VICTORIA gracing one of the walls. Other pictures and rich mirrors served to relieve the deep crimson drapery. All the sofas, lounges and chairs were of purple velvet, studded with golden-headed nails; while a richly-polished rosewood buffet, under one of the mirrors, supported such refreshments as might be agreeable during the course of an evening's dance.Attached to this parlor were two small dressing or retiring-rooms, carpeted with green cloth, very refreshing to the eye, and only decorated with such cool objects as lace, marble, pictures, mirrors and flowers. Here, any additions or re-embellishments of the Royal toilette might be made; and in one of these, if so disposed, his Royal Highness might at ease enjoy the mingled luxuries of a cigar and rocking chair.Passing out from these through a brief passage, we emerge at the stage-end of the ball-room, on which the reception-dais has been elevated. The whole floor of theatre and stage has been made one level plain with polished planks, the dancing space running clear over the parquette and only breaking into discontinuance against the crimson velvet seats of the dress-circle, which had been wisely and charitably reserved as resting places for all the wearied or non-dancing guests.Over the stage, in the space formerly occupied by scenic grooves and other operatic machinery, a splendid marquee of white silk has been erected, the centre of which contains Arabesque drawings of geometrical figures in red and blue. The end of the hall-room behind the purple-velvet dais, or raised platform of three steps, is occupied by a scene richly and admirably painted, representing a long vista of cool green trees, stretching away until blockaded by a spouting fountain. Whether the artist intended it or not, we cannot say; but he has made in this scene a pretty faithful picture of the grand avenue which stretches from the main entrance of Windsor Castle to the fountains and statues of Virginia Water.This portion of the ball-room was brilliantly illuminated by two large circular chandeliers, each bearing more than twenty globes of light, and presenting the appearance of having been manufactured out of Florentine gold. Between these and the general body of the house, two smaller chandeliers were suspended on golden pipes; and each tier of the boxes was furnished with an additional row of lamps, placed just beneath the regular opera-evening lights.Looking at the main body of the house from that portion usually occupied by the stage, the scene was magnificent in the true sense of the word, all that art could effect at the suggestion of luxury being supplied in the most lavish profusion. It was a vista of gilding, yellow satin, wreathed pillars, crimson velvet and flowers, with semi-circular double lines of light illuminating the whole, tier above tier, until finally the eye reached a pictorial disk of ceiling, from which a pleasant variety of heathen gods and goddesses appeared in the very act of fluttering down from their \"amber clouds\" to take part in the revelry beneath.Flowers everywhere and in all dispositions, were a predominating and delightful feature of the decorations. Not a cornice or jutting ledge of gilt fresco-work but was made to support something more than its fair share of floral beauty. Immense vases of Sevres china uplifted from their tapering necks mighty pyramids of perfume and varied tintage; every festoon of drapery had its particular bouquet; not a chandelier or lamp of all the many through the building but had depending from it, or wreathed around it, rich, trophies plucked from all gardens and hot-houses within the radius of a morning's jaunt.Directly behind the crimson velvet seats of the dress circle, a semi-circular conservatory had been formed, the cool green foliage of growing plants contrasting pleasantly with the pillars of white and gold which support the first row of boxes, and being further brilliantly diversified by large crystal globes, filled with gold and silver fish, which gleamed out here and there, thorough dark openings in the leaves and flowers. Turning round at this point -- that at which the guests gained their first view of the main scene -- the full effect of the stage arrangement could not fail to elicit admiration.All the proscenium had been regilded and redecorated,the six private boxes on each side having new curtains of amber satin, covered with lace and looped with cords of bullion, to which bullion tassels were appended. All the fronts of the various tiers of boxes had likewise been regilt and brightened -- the lowest of the three tiers being held in reserve on each side for the orchestra. Gilding and flowers and sculpture sprang upward from floor to dome, a brief crimson drop-curtain in front of the stage, (hanging just low enough to conceal the junction of the marquee already described with the remainder of the building,) displaying in its centre an allegorical piece, crowned with, the Three Plumes of the youthful Prince, and representing at its sides the flags and arms of England, the United States and the Stats of New-York harmoniously blended around an indescribable painting, in which lions, beavers, eagles, anchors and tobacco bales formed the most prominent features.Around the room and on each side of the stage in front of the dais, were sofas, lounges and seats, covered with dark wine-colored velvet. The two upper tiers of boxes, and all the private boxes, were thrown open to guests who did not wish to dance, or who were weary of dancing, or who had passed their dancing days. These might be regarded as retreats sacred to that amiable but not amusing social class known as \"wall flowers\" and non-dancing people. Here they might sit at ease, and look down, in a literal, no less than a metaphorical sense, on the frivolities which were taking place beneath them. Mystic, indeed, are the ways of Providence, inventing for every age and aspect of humanity some pleasant self-delusion of virtue which makes up for the absence of of any more keen enjoyment!Having sufficiently surveyed the main building, its flashing lights, swinging draperies and flower-uplifting caryatides, we now go round to the regular opera-entrance for guests on Irving-place, where the whole porch, with its missive brown-stone pillars, is a wave with flags, pennons, banners, streamers, and other patriotic emblems worked in dry-goods of silk or canvas. The steps are carpeted with crimson cloth, all the entrance-halls and stairways are similarly covered; the equestrian portrait of Queen VICTORIA by WINTERHALTER, and Count D'ORSAY is opposite the main entrance; and up those crimson-covered stairways to the right, New-York beauty has to trip on its way to the full revealment of toilette-glories and natural grace. To be a little more plain-spoken, the dressing-rooms and parlors for ladies are upon the floor overhead, in the regions usually occupied by the promenade and refreshment saloons of the opera.These boudoirs, as we have been informed by a private spy whose good nature has betrayed her into the indiscretion of a description, have all been furnished on a similar pattern with the retiring-rooms behind the stage devoted to the use of Baron RENFREW. They have carpets of green cloth, with Arabesque tracings, rich dressing-tables, fringed with lace, and any conceivable quantity of marble-topped tables, bureaus, and such like, the walls being made of mirrors, so arranged as to reflect all profiles of lithe and blythe crinoline at once. But these are mysteries on which the pen of journalism has no license to intrude. The most apologetic bow is made, and we \"walk backward with averted gaze,\" never daring even to cast a second glance at that delightful blonde in blue and white who is arranging a stray ringlet at the corner mirror.As for the supper-room, the only portion not yet described, it is a special construction of wood, connected with the Prince's private entrance on Fourteenth-street, and running back about one hundred and forty feet, by thirty-seven, on the vacant lot between the Academy of Music and the Medical University. Inside this wooden waterproof structure, a long tent ceiling of red, white and blue stripes of silk has been constructed, falling down in graceful curves on either side of the central supporting-line. The walls are of the same material, at least so much of them as is not hidden from sight by the many mirrors upon each side.At the northern end of this hall, which communicates directly with the Prince's parlor, a short table runs across, magnificently set forth with gold and silver epergnes, gold and silver salvers, crystal, china, fruits, flowers and architectural wonders of confectionery. The wall behind this is festooned with British and American flags, draped round an enormous mirror; while at the southern end of the hall, facing His Royal Highness, whose table we have been describing, is another festoon arrangement of patriotic and symbolical drapery, enshrining a shield, which has emblazoned on it the arms of England, surmounted by three plumes of prismatic crystal through which a varying light streams forth over the entire length of the hall.Down the sides of tide long room, tables of about one hundred and twenty-feet in length, and furnished in the usual handsome style of New-York supper-tables, are arranged on slightly raised platforms, so that from the Prince's table every guest in the room can be seen, and vice versa. The lower space between these platforms is carpeted with damask of a brownish hue and kept clear for the incursions and retreats of the army of waiters in attendance. With these tables, having ranged on each side of them all the best beauty and fashion of the Empire City, the vista of mirrors and banners being closed by the magnificence of the royal table, -- who shall dare say that New-York has not given a royal reception to the son of a Sovereign Lady whose virtues, even more than her position, have endeared her to the respect of all intelligent and candid minds?Next to being on the inside of a ball-room it is good to be on the out. If you have failed to procure tickets, and are a philosopher, you can console yourself with the reflection that it is a great deal better. The atmosphere inside is apt to be hot and stifling; your poor lungs, instead of drinking in the unadulterated air which Nature uncorked for them on the world's natal day, are forced to swallow the chemically-concocted perfumes wherewith ladies always come laden. To mingle in the inner festivities you are obliged to attire yourself in a stiff suit of black, indulge in the expense of new gloves, and, possibly, of a bouquet. Then, too, you are obliged to contribute to the amusement of others; it is incumbent upon you to dance, -- this is a labor of love to which a great many rational beings entertain a decided distaste. They do things much better in those Oriental countries, where servants dutifully dance for the delectation of their masters. Looking at a quadrille or a polka you enjoy the poetry of motion without the labor of moving. In like manner, standing on the outside of a ball-room, and occasionally peeping through a window, or firing a snap-shot of a glance through a door, as it opens and closes, you enjoy advantages from which the poor participants in the pageantry are debarred. So far from envying them, you come to regard them with a pious pity, and would not change places with them for the world. There is a great deal more elbow-room in the street. You are not troubled about the arrangement of your cravat, nor the perpendicularity of your shirt collar. The ladies are obliged to defile past you as they alight from their carriages, and thus you are enabled to pass the feminine battalions in a full-dress parade, precisely as the Prince did the cohorts of the City and National Guards.Token all in all, it is indeed much better to be outside of a ball-room than in, and thus a great many people thought last evening at the Prince's Ball; for that the attendance outside was much the greatest, no one for a moment will dispute. Some may incline to dissent from the comforting proposition advanced in this introductory paragraph, but it was the source of much comfort to a legion of contemplative philosophers who last night contented themselves with the street festivities, to which they had a standing invitation.The street guests arrived much earlier than the formally invited, and came on foot instead of in carriages. This they did to prevent confusion. The arrangements made for their accommodation were ample. Capt. CAMERON, who officiated in Irving-place, and Capt. TURNBULL, who did the honors in Fourteenth-street, set aside the whole opposite pavement for their accommodation, and kept the intervening streets clear, that their view might not in any way be intercepted. A broad river of cobble-stone ran between the invited and the outvited, so that no unpleasant mingling might occur. Truth compels the admission that the street guests were not quite as well dressed as the others. None of the ladies bore bouquets, and many of them, in the hurry of dressing, had forgotten to slip on cloaks, and some came even without bonnets, the monotony of their rags unrelieved by a single gleam of Solferino or the most remote tint of Magenta. The gentlemen generally had shocking bad hats, and some had no hats at all. But their behavior was unexceptionable, and this, after all, is the main point.At about half-past 7 the carriages began to roll to the doors, freighted with living loads of beauty. The carriages of the Reception Committee and of a few of the most distinguished guests came to the Fourteenth-street door; but the greater portion disbursed their contents at the living-place entrance. By $1/2 the tide of carriages was flowing in full force. John hurried John, and wheel pressed upon wheel and it was only by cautioning shouts and warning waves of the land that the policemen in attendance succeeded in preventing the poles of arriving carriages from perforating the panels of those which were momentarily in dock. From the magically unfolding doors of the vehicles ladies leaped, sprang in quick succession like faries in a pantomimic scene, glittering with diamonds and floating in lace. The argosy of Jason was less richly freighted than the fleet of carriages which last night disembarked their treasures at the Academy of Music. The calcium lights lent a brilliancy to the scene outshining that of day; and the lean-eyed, hungry-mouthed crowd on the opposite pavement looked over and wondered how so much wealth could be in the world and they so poor. Occasionally, when a beauty brighter than her sisters gave her little hand to her attendant, and sprang lightly from her carriage to the ground, her ear-drops sparkling in the night like a thousand dew-beads, they clapped their hands and shouted their delight that some were happy, though they were miserable.But the grand event of the evening, and that for which the street-guests waited in impatient expectancy, was the arrival of the Prince and suite. Prince ROTHSCHILD came at an early hour, hut his coming created no sensation. Distinguished citizens blighted, but no cheers followed their steps. Gen. WYBB drove to the Irving-place door with his party, democratically, in an omnibus; but the quaint contrast of his vehicle to the others scarce exerted a chime of laughter. They looked for a Prince of the blood. And at a little past 10 o'clock the Prince came. His carriage drove to the Fourteenth-street door, and ALBERT EDWARD, with his suite, entered the Academy. But few knew of his arrival, few detected this royal presence. A little boy, held by his father, who was posted, peered into the Prince's face as he passed, and said, in a distinctly audible tone: \"Why, pa, he is only a man!\" The little fellow had looked for some different anatomy in a prince. Ignorant of the fact that the glory of the evening had culiminated, the waiting crowd preserved their weary posture, and looked with all their eyes for ALBERT EDWARD's coming. None dreamed that the fair-haired, fresh-faced young gentleman, in a simple ball-room dress, who, for a moment, appeared on the sidewalk to disappear within the guarded doors, could, by any possibility, be the heir of England. They, evidently, looked for purple robes, and some outward manifestation of that dignity which is popularly supposed to hedge a king.The stars on the breasts of several members of the Prince's suite glimmered in the gas-light, but the uninformed crowd confounded them with the policemen's; and so ALBERT EDWARD came upon the ground and entered the ball-room building unrecognized by those who waited to ring their greetings into his ears. Perhaps their silence pleased him better. It must have gratified him to know that he could pass in a crowd and not be singled out by any peculiarity of gait or manner as distinguished from the generality of created beings. To be a celibrity, and be constantly pointed out as such, cannot be pleasant, however the popular opinion may incline to the contrary. The youthful GUELPH is blessed with a good share of practical common sense, and can distinguish between the stare of curiosity and the look of silent praise. He knows that at present, save his princely lineage, he possesses no claim to the world's homage; that whatever he may achieve before joining the long line of kings that have gone before him, he has as yet done nothing that men should hang upon his steps with adulation and admiration.The tide of carriages continued to roll until after 11; by half-past ten it had materially slackened, and in half an hour later the arrivals were few and scattering. Among the later guests came Gen. SCOTT, attired in full and well-earned uniform, his step as firm as when, years ago, he led his regiments to battle, his bearing proud as a king's.When our reporter left the scene the inner festivities seemed at their height; bursts of gay music rang through the sometimes-open door, the measure distinctly audible to all the street, yet, strange to say, the outer guests were not dancing. They fringed the curb-stones and selveged the pavement with undiminished numbers, steadfastly gazing to discover a Prince, and wondering why he came not. Patient souls; even at the hour of this writing they are probably looking and waiting, anxious for their hope, and yet semi-despairing of its fruition.In relation to the police arrangements of last evening too much praise cannot well be said. By some accident a remarkably gentlemanly force were detailed for the occasion -- men who seemed to recognize the truth that in some cases quite as much may be effected by a word and smile as by an oath and a blow. Captains CAMERON and TURNBULL were omnipresent along their line of duty, preserving a real order among apparent chaos, and straitening out the long string of carriages when there seemed any danger of its becoming tangled. That no accidents occurred is due wholly to their efficient exertions, and speaks more in their praise than any word that can be written.Hardly less numerous than the crowd that swarmed around the Academy of Music to greet the arrival of the Prince, was the throng that gathered about the Fifth-avenue Hotel to witness his departure for the Ball. Early in the evening, the sidewalk in Twenty-third-street, opposite the hotel, was covered with men, women and children, eagerly gazing at the private entrance through which it was expected his Lordship would make his exit. As the hours wore away, fresh additions to the throng were momentarily added, until at 10 o'clock, the hour fixed for his departure, the walk on both sides of the street was densely packed with male and female, aged, middle-aged, youthful, juvenile and even infantile specimens of the curious-loving public. The delay of the Prince in making his appearance gave rise to varied manifestations of impatience on the part of those who were so anxious to see him. Many were inclined to think that they had been made the victims of a grand sell, and that His Royal Highness was not in the hotel at all, or if there, that he would make his exit by some other door, and thus avoid alike the gaze and the greetings of the throng.Some one started the rumor that he was to dine last evening with Mr. GRINNELL, and would undoubtedly go direct from there to the ball. Others said he was dining with Mayor WOOD, and still others that he had not yet returned from his tour of the Central Park. A few were of the opinion that he was afraid of the lunatic who attempted to assault him in the morning, and that it was very doubtful whether he would attend the Ball at all. All, however, continued to watch the private entrance to the hotel, and to keep an eye upon the dim light that shone through, the lattice of his suite of rooms on the second story.\"And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,\"What potent cause delayed my Lord Renfrew.At length four or five carriages were seen to whirl out of Fifth-avenue down Twenty-third-street, and to the great joy and relief of the crowd, they drew up in a row to the curbstone opposite the private entrance. All surmises, conjectures and wonders were immediately brought to an end, and those individuals who had indulged in the aforesaid absurd speculations were at once reminded of their stupidity, and of the superior wisdom of their companions.It was not long before Mr. Collector SCHELL made his appearance, and when he was seen to go into the private entrance, it was considered a fixed fact that the Prince was inside, and would in all probability soon make his appearance. And so it proved, for in a few minutes after there was an unwonted bustle, and an extra flourish among the Police who guarded the entrance, and directly thereafter the door swung upon its hinges, His Royal Highness, ALBERT EDWARD, stood in full view of a street full of citizens. He was accompanied on either side by Lord LYONS and the Duke of Newcastle, and from his boyish appearance was immediately recognized by the crowd, who greeted him with unanimous, hearty and repeated cheers. He immediately stepped into his carriage with his two attendants, and was driven quickly down Fifth-avenue to Fourteenth-street, and disappeared in the distance, amid the vociferous shouts of the assembled multitude. The Prince's suite, together with Collector SCHELL, and several members of the Ball Committee, followed directly after in the other carriages which stood in waiting, and when the last coach had disappeared from the street, the men and women, but particularly the women, took a last, long, lingering look at the windows of the Prince's apartments, and then quietly retired to their homes.A cool, bracing Autumn day, with skies of the bluest and sunshine of the brightest, greeted the Prince of Wales and his party yesterday morning as they issued from the private entrance on Twenty-third-street of the Fifth-avenue Hotel at 25 minutes before 10 o'clock and prepared to enter the carriages which were awaiting them. An immense crowd, gathered in the streets adjacent, had for two hours been on tip-toe to see the young gentleman come forth. The hotel was garrisoned with policemen, and about the doors they were posted in sufficient force to keep the people at a respectful distance,and keep clear a narrow avenue of approach to the barouche that the heir of Britain's crown was to ride in. Order was excellently well preserved. An occurrence took place at this point, of which, in some of the evening papers, greatly exaggerated accounts appeared, setting forth, with large letters, that there had been an attempt to shoot his Lordship. The facts are simply that as the Baron RENFREW was leaving the hotel, a man, dressed in a sailor's garb, rushed toward him, and in an excited way called out, \"You never shall be King of England, if you live a hundred years,\" or words to that effect The police quickly removed the man, and took him before Justice CONNOLLY, at the Jefferson Market Police Court. He was question as to his motive for behaving so disorderly, when he replied that he was an Englishman and a Democrat, EDWARD MONCAN by name, employed as second mate of the steamer Santa Claus, and that he entertained a strong antipathy to monarchical Governments and their representatives. The magistrate reprimanded him for his conduct, and allowed him to depart. The Prince, not at all disconcerted by the occurrence, entered his carriage -- the same vehicle provided by Mr. E. VAH RANST, of No. 273 Canal-street, which conveyed him in the procession, of Thursday -- and accompanied by Mayor WOOD, Lord LYONS, and his own, suite, was driven rapidly down Fifth-avenue and through Waverley-place to the New-York University. Here another large assemblage greeted him with cheers and the waving of handkerchiefs. There was no delay in opening a path through the wilderness of human beings at this point, nor at any other of the places which were visited during the day -- General Superintendent KENNEDY and Inspector LEONARD, who rode before the Royal party, had arranged all this, admirably. The Chancellor, faculties, students and their friends, received the regal visiters in the large Chapel. The hall was thronged with ladies and gentlemen. The Chancellor, professors and students, were in their gowns. The Baron and his retinue took a position on the left-hand side of the platform, and the Chancellor, Rev. Dr. ISAAC FERRIS, standing on the right hand side, surrounded by the officers of the College and distinguished guests -- among them Rev. Drs. HUTTON, SKINNER and POTTS, Gen. SANFORD and WM. CURTIS NOYES, Esq. -- addressed the Prince thus:THE CHAIRMAN's ADDRESS.BARON RENFREW -- Honored Sir: It is my privilege, in behalf of the Council and Faculties of the University of the City of New-York, to welcome you to our marble halls, and to tender our gratulations that a a kind Providence has been around and over and with you since you left your native country. We rejoice, and our successors will rejoice, that you were led to cross the broad Atlantic, before the responsibilities of life were assumed, and become acquainted with the condition of the Anglo-Saxon race in this great Western World. In our country you behold the eminently thriving state of a young branch of your own people. We are fond to trace our origin to the same source, and to claim the interest of sons in the arts, sciences and literature of the land of our forefathers. Your BACON, your SHAKESPEARE, your MILTON, and the whole galaxy of glorious names on the scroll of your country, we claim as ours as well -- their labors furnishing the treasures on which we freely draw, and the models after which we mold our culture -- while to their shrines we love to make a scholar's pilgrimage. While you see among us numerous illustrations of substantial material progress, we are proud to ask your attention to our expanded systems of education. Our admirable common school systems (now very extensively introduced in the States,) carrying, as they do, the advantages of substantial intellectual culture to the doors of the great masses necessarily bound to labor, are telling happily on the intelligence of the people. Placed, as I have been, in circumstances to see their workings, I am astonished as I attempt to recount to myself the results secured in the lapse of my own life. Our higher institutions of learning have risen in rapid succession, and constitute the crowning stage in the preparation for life. They are not grouped in a few towns or cities. They are found in what may be called central points to large populations, no city except New York having more than one for the same curriculum of study. Our colleges and universities have risen to over 120; our theological schools to 51; our law schools to 19; and our medical schools to 41 -- all these being schools for professional preparation. I am happy in making you welcome to this University -- an institution founded and cherished by the liberality of the merchants of this City, a princely class of men in the magnitude of their plans and the munificence with which they sustain them. Here they have founded a practical institution where the means of preparation for life shall be as varied as the wants of society demand. Here, beside the College proper, we have six professional schools or colleges, and on our records, during the last study year, numbered 679 youths and young men.Our work has been pursued with a satisfactory degree of success for an institution founded 28 years since, while it has been our privilege to see most important contributions made by our professors to the general fund of social benefits. You will pardon us, that we refer with gratified feelings to the fact that this edifice was the birthplace of the electro-magnetic telegraph, our Professor MORSE having, within a few feet of where we stand, made his first successful experiment, and passed over his wires of twenty miles length the talismanic Eureka. In this building, also, by DRAPER, one of our Professors, Photography was fist applied to the taking of portraits from life. Here, by means he discovered, was made the first picture of a human face by the light of the sun, while the thing was looked upon as chimerical in Europe. And, under this roof, by the same DRAPER, were made all those experiments (now accepted by the medical profession all over, the world) which first demonstrated the true cause, of the circulation of the blood, your own immortal HARVEY having demonstrated its course.Allow me, honored Sir, to tender through you our acknowledgments, for the royal munificence of your Government (first in the person of WILLIAM IV., and after him in the person of your venerated mother, whose name we all pronounce with admiration, republicans as we are,) in most valuable governmental records, and to your royal observatories for their publications. Lastly, I beg to convey, through you, to the British scientists our special thanks for the very kind attention and abundant courtesies shown our DRAPER on his visit to the annual meeting of the British Association, last Summer, at Oxford, and at the several institutions of learning. These things indicate the feelings which should animate the brotherhood of science and literature, and will burnish to a brighter lustre, the chain which binds the two branches of a great family. Soon you will have accomplished the great object which brought you to American shores. Our prayer is that the same gracious Providence which brought you here will, in perfect safety, reconvey you to your own land, and the loved circle which will have noticed with the deepest intentness of interest your progress among us. I respectfully ask your attention to the action of our council in view of your visit.The Prince bowed his acknowledgments to the greetings of the Chancellor, and listened to the reading of the following preamble and resolutions, by HENRY VAN SCHAICK, Esq.:RESOLUTIONS OF THE COUNCIL.UNIVERSITY OF THE CITY OF NEW-YORK.The Chancellor having communicated to this Council that the Baron Renfrew has accepted the invitation to visit the University this day with his suite, therefore,Resolved, That the Council of the University of the City of New-York welcome every event calculated to cherish feeling of warm reciprocal regard and to unite more closely in the ties of fraternal fellowship Protestant England and these United States.Resolved, That in view of the relation Baron Renfrew bears to the land which we still claim as \"the mother country, and of his connection with the classic seats of learning which we admire and seek to imitate, this Council regard his visit to this country as eminently tending to promote objects so desirable and we greet him with heartfelt welcome to our halls this day.Resolved, That as we are bound to England by the three-fold chord of ancestry, of language, and our \"King James Bible,\" we feel we are brethren, and may claim it as a right to rejoice in every testimony of respect paid the sovereign people of this land to the representative and heir of England's model Queen.Adopted in Council this 12th day of October, 1860.HENRY VAN SCHAICK, Sec'y.REMARKS OF PROF. MORSE.Prof. MORSE then addressed the Prince, to whom he had been previously introduced, as follows:An allusion in most flattering terms to me, rendered doubly so in such presence, has been, made by our respected Chancellor, which seems to call for at least the expression of my thanks. At the same time it suggest the relation of an incident in the early history of the Telegraph, which may not be inappropriate to this occasion. The infant telegraph, born and nursed within these walls, had scarcely attained a feeble existence, ere it essayed to make its voice heard on the other side of the Atlantic. I carried it to Paris in 1838. It attracted the warm interest not only of the Continental philosophers, but also of the intelligent and appreciative among the e[???]inent nobles of Britain, then on a visit to the French Capital. Foremost among these was the late Marquis of Northampton, then President of the Royal Society, the late distinguished Earl of Elgin, and in a marked degree the noble Earl of Lincoln. This last named nobleman, in a special manner, gave it his favor; he comprehended its important future, and in the midst of the serpticism clouded its cradle, he risked his character for sound judgment in venturing to stand godfather for the friendless child. He took it under his roof in London, invited the statesmen and the philosophers Britain to see it, and urged forward with kindly words and generous attentions, those who had the infant in charge. It is with no ordinary feelings therefore, that after the lapse of twenty years I have singular honor this, morning of greeting with hearty welcome in such presence, before such an assemblage, and in the cradle of the Telegraphed, this noble Earl of Lincoln, in the person of, the present Duke of Newcastle.To all this the Prince simply bowed assent. The Chancellor now said:Baron RENFREW -- I have the honor to introduce to you the Rev. Professors on your right, and the members of the Faculty on your left; and also the wives, sisters and relatives of the members of the University who composed the audience before you.The Baron bowed, the ladies waved their handkerchiefs, and then the Royal party descended from the platform.A line of the students in long silk gowns, and bearing staffs ornamented with ribbons, formed a semicircle from the wide open doors of the chapel to the door of the Womans' Library, into which the Prince entered, leaning on the arm of the Chancellor. The room was crowded with ladies, richly attired in full matinee toilet, and several well-known gentlemen, accompanied by their wives were present, among whom BENJ. H. FIELD, A.V. STOUT, Judge HILTON, JOHN JAY, ISAAC BELL, Jr., FREDERICK DE PEYSTER, and others. The Prince, after bowing to the ladies and others. The Prince, after bowing to the ladies and gentlemen, listened to a few words in relation to the Library from the Chancellor. Miss POWELL was then presented to the Prince, and said, on behalf of the ladies, \"Baron, we are happy to welcome to a Woman's Library the son of a royal lady whom the women of America regard as an honor and a pride to all womanhood.\" The Prince smilingly bowed his acknowledgements.From the Library, all except the Prince and his suite were excluded. A brief period was spent within, and then they proceeded to the Cooper Institute. Here Mr. PETER COOPER received the Prince and conducted him through the building, into which a great many spectators had been admitted. He viewed the free reading room, the gallery of fine arts, the drawing-school, the school of design for women, the class-rooms -- everything, except the lecture-room. Mr. COOPER explained things as he went along. There were, he said, 2,000 students at present on the books of the Institute, consisting of persons of various pursuits. The mathematical and scientific classes, had the largest number of pupils, and all branches were taught gratuitously.The Free Academy was next visited. Crowds were assembled there. Dr. WEBSTER, standing at the head of the first flight of stairs, welcomed his guests cordially, and leading them to the library, which was thronged, introduced them to the Professors.After a brief inspection of the Library the Baron was led by Dr. WEBSTER to the Chapel, which was occupied by over seven hundred students, who were all seated. Upon arriving at the platform, Dr. WEBSTER invited the Baron to occupy a position behind the desk, when waiving his hand he said, \"These are our students.\" The young men immediately rose in a body, and remained standing while Dr. WEBSTER further said, \"These are the representatives of the people, all classes being represented, from the laborer up the richest merchant in the City;\" at which the Baron bowed, and said it was a very interesting sight to him. The Prince and those with him inscribed their autographs in the album, and as they turned to leave some of the boys began to clap their hands; the applause was suppressed, however, by the officers of the institution. Riding up to the Fifth-avenue, Forty second street and Broadway, the cortege was followed by many in carriages and on horseback. It was about 12 1/2 o'clock when the Central Park was reached. The carriages entered from Eighth-avenue. A map of the Park was placed in the hands of the Prince, and Commissioners BLATCHFORD, GREEN, RUSSEL and FIELD were presented to him. Led by Mr. GREEN, all proceeded to the West side of the mall, where an immense crowd was assembled around an open space, kept clear by the Police and laborers. Here the Prince and his party alighted, and the President of the Central Park Commissioners addressed the former thus:MR. BLATCHFORD's ADDRESS.LORD RENFREW -- The Commissioners of the Central Park, to whom the State of New-York have intrusted the construction of this great pleasure ground for the people, have requested me to ask you to do them the favor to plant here two trees -- one an English oak, the other an American elm. They trust these trees will long flourish and remain a lasting memorial of your visit to this City and this Park.The trees were in their places and the Baron, taking old of them, threw a shovel full of earth round the root of each -- and the ceremony was over. The Prince and his party rode through the prettiest parts of the Park, and alighting again threaded the Ramble with MR. GREEN, who pointed out to them every object of interest. At a little before 1 o'clock the ride was resumed and through 71st street the cortege passed to the Bloomingdale road, and so to the residence of Mayor WOOD. Multitudes were by the roadside and cheered them as they passed. The little children of the Orphans' Home, dressed in their best attire, stood and waved their hats and handkerchiefs as the Prince rode by, and the carriages turned into the Mayor's private road. Among the guests that sat down with the Prince to the collation provided by the Mayor, were Ex-President FILLMORE, Bishop POTTER, Archbishop HUGHES, MOSES TAYLOR, Judge ROOSEVELT, CYRUS W. FIELD, MADAME LE VERT and daughter, and the daughter of the Mayor. A couple of hours were spent here, and next the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb was visited. The exercises here were exceedingly interesting and the Prince seemed especially well pleased with them. Mr. B.R. WINTHROP, President of the Board of Directors, welcomed him as he ascended to the porch, and conducted the party to the chapel, where the pupils were assembled, all tastefully dressed for the occasion and many ladies and gentlemen were seated behind them. As soon as the royal visitors were seated near the stage, Mr. HARVEY P. PEET, the Principal, addressed the Prince as follows:ADDRESS OF MR. PEET.BARON RENFREW: In behalf of the Institution which I have the honor to represent, I tender to your Lordship a cordial welcome, not the less sincere though of necessity brief. In your Lordship's tour through our extensive country your Lordship has seen every variety of natural scenery, -- our lakes, our rivers, our mountains, our broad prairies, our cities and municipal institutions, and have everywhere. I trust, received that respect and consideration suited to your Lordship's high position and prospects; but this Institution is the first of the kind which your Lordship has visited since your arrival in this country. It was founded in 1817, has steadily increased as the wants of the community demanded, and now numbers 300 pupils. Its object is to impart Intellectual and moral light to those who sit in darkness, and elevate them to the dignity of thinking and rational beings. They cannot, give utterance to their joy and gratification on this occasion in vocal speech, but they can express the emotions of their hearts with equal sincerity and earnestness in the language of action.So saying, Mr. PEET called to the platform three little boys and three little girls, who had been in the institution but four weeks, and whose proficiency in writing was exhibited greatly to the credit of their instructors. Then he called upon another half-dozen of scholars, more advanced -- three young ladies and three young gentlemen -- who had been in the institution for four years. Addressing these in the language of signs, he informed them that Lord RENFREW had come to visit them, and requested them to write on the black-board anything that they deemed expressive of their sense of the high honor conferred on the institution. The following were some of the essays thus called forth:MISS MONTGOMERY's ESSAY.From the length and breadth of our land has rolled one glad acclaim of welcome to the Heir of England and the son of her peerless Queen; and though we may not join our voices in the glad roll of sound, our pleasure is not the less heartfelt, nor our welcome the less warm to him to whom the world looks as the future ruler of its mightiest nation, and the proud retinue of England and America's noblemen who accompany him here to-day. Others have expressed far better than it is given us to do, the objects of our Institution, and the degree of success which has attended those who, in imitation of their Divine Master, have sought to give ears to the deaf and a tongue to the voiceless.And though the methods pursued in this country and in England may be different, the spirit is the same, and when again the white cliffs of Albion, as they rise from the ocean's blue, announce that \"Merrie England\" is near, and the heart of our guest beats high with the glad greetings of his own people, we would wish him to remember that there are those among them who are silent because God hath sealed their lips. E. IDA MONTGOMERY.ANOTHER BY THE SAME.I have been asked to express my idea of music -- that all-powerful influence which holds the hearts of men in such a mysterious thrall -- which has power to disarm the savage, and cause the wild beast to forget its ferociousness, creating while it lasts a brief but ecstatic millenium. That incomprehensible something which gushed from the overflowing heart of David, heralded the birth of the Saviour, and now floats around the throne of God. What it may be in its bodily shape, if I may so express it, I know not but I know its spirit to be harmony -- and it is not alone through the medium of music that this divine spirit can make its influence felt, for we can see it in the ceaseless beat of the ocean, the dark flow of the river, and even in the waving arms and blended colors of the trees that crown our own palisades. Nor is music alone found in inanimate Nature, in things perishable, for there, are those whose lives are but one grand pean, which at last merges in the perfect harmony of the perfected God. E. IDA MONTGOMERY.WILLIS HUBBARD'S ESSAYS.It is with unbounded pleasure we welcome to our institution the Prince of Wales, or Baron Renfrew, under which hereditary fi[???]e he is traveling in this country with his suite. As our silent tongues will not permit us to welcome him by chaunting national airs, we hope that our giving Baron Renfrew a heartfelt welcome in writing on these States -- the materials of which came from the province of which he is styled the Prince -- will be sufficient to express our true feelings.Since Professor MORSE applied electricity to wires for the purpose of conveying messages from one place to another with lightning rap[???], if has been the object of many scientific gentlemen to establish a cable across the Atlantic Ocean between the United States and Great Britain. A trial was made and messages were conveyed across the wide Atlantic; holidays were given in honor of the triumph, and all the true citizens of England and America rejoiced at the new tie that bound us to our Mother country. But all these were destined to be disappointed, for, after working a few weeks, cable refused to carry messages across the ocean.WILLIS HUBBARD.DAVID R. TILLINGHAST'S ESSAYS.It is with a full appreciation of the great honor which the Prince of Wales has conferred upon us that we extend a cordial welcome to him. We feel that our speaking fellow-men who have greeted him in every part of this country which he has passed through could not be more cordial than we in expressing our pleasure in seeing him. We see in the Prince a future King of the British Empire, who will count among his subjects millions of free and Christian men. For such a vast responsibility the Prince has been prepared by a mother whom I regard as the most Christian Queen I ever read of in history.The Great Eastern is a grand specimen of what English genius could achieve. This achievement in mechanical science, is ranked among the proudest triumphs of which the British boast. This great ship may be one of the signs, \"that the sword will soon be turned into the plough share, and the spear into the pruning-hook.\"DAVID R. TILLINGHAST.While they were writing these, Miss GERTRUDE WALTER, of this City, delivered by gesture the beautiful poem given below, composed in honor of the occasion by Mrs. H.L. PEET, Jr., who is herself deaf and dumb, and who graduated at the institution. The husband of the latter recited the poem, while Miss WALTER made the signs:WELCOME TO THE PRINCE.BY MRS. MARY TOLES PEET.Once from beyond the azure sea,There came to us a welcome tone.Men paused amid their strife and toil,To list the voice from England's throne.And soon from out the ocean's depths,Where master minds a chain had bound,A strong pulsation shook the land,And silence hushed the New World's sound.How breathlessly men stopped to countThe throbs that came with measured beat,Till one by one, with trembling joy,Beheld the mystic bond complete;The strange, new thrill sped fast and far,And waking joy throughout the land,Went forth the greeting England sent,\"We'll evermore go hand in hand.\"Old Ocean, in his wild dismay,That Man from him his power had wonTo part the nations, rent the bond,But England sends us now here son.Right loyally we greet him, too,For every heart should bend, I ween,In homage to such worth as thatWhich sits enthroned in England's Queen.And though no purples hang aboveThe brave young Briton here,Yet retinues of kindred heartsSend up to heaven this cheer:\"God save the Queen -- God save the Prince,And blessings on them shower,And strengthen every rightful causeThat adds to England's power.\"INST. FOR THE DEAR AND DUMB, Oct. 12, 1860.At the conclusion of the recitations, at his own request, the Prince was introduced to Miss WALTER and to Mrs. PEET. The autographs of the Prince and his companions were written in the \"Visitor's Book,\" and then the party went on to the platform at the request of Mr. PEET, while the latter informed first the pupils and afterwards the audience which was the Prince and which severally were the most distinguished of his followers. The Prince laughed good-naturedly at the whimsicality of this proceeding, and took his leave.Another ride of half an hour brought him to the foot of Two Hundred and Fifteenth-street, where, at the Century Dock, the trim little steamer Trumpeter, decked with the Royal and Republican ensigns, was screaming her salutation at his approach. All were soon on board, and there the Prince was introduced to Messrs. SIMEON DRAPER, ISAAC BELL, Jr., and A.B. NICHOLSON, Commissioners of Charities and Corrections, whom the Mayor had invited to accompany the party in an excursion past the islands on which the public institutions are located, and point out to the Prince their several idiosyncrasies. There, too, the Directors of the Juvenile Asylum, A.K. WETMORE, President, were presented to the Prince. A visit to their institution the Prince had been compelled to decline. Several ladies were on board too, and with them the Prince and the younger gentlemen of his suite engaged in a spirited conversation. The sail through Harlem River, under High Bridge, and to the East River, was a most delightful one, and all seemed exhilhrated by it. Though it had not been made known that the royal party was to make this excursion, at many points along the shore the people were assembled numerously, and as the Prince raised his hat they waved their handkerchiefs and cheered him. At Randall's Island the children of the Nursery and of the House of Refuge were drawn up in line on the shore, and a huge banner bearing the following inscription was fluttering: \"The children of Randall's Island, on behalf of their liberal protectors, welcome the representative of an honored land -- Old England.\" The children shouted and waved their hands, and the Prince saluted them. At Ward's Island the emigrants received him en passant, in the same way. Near the entrance to Harlem River the Harriet Lane was at anchor, her yards manned, with the British ensign at the fore, the pennant at the main and the American ensign at the peak. The Trumpeter was thrown alongside of her and her passengers were transferred to the deck of the cutter. The North Carrolina Band, stationed on the cutter, struck, up \"God Save the Queen,\" the Trumpeter fell behind, and the beautiful vessel on whose deck the Prince now stood glided down the East River. It was just the hour at which the huge steamboats of the Sound pass up. The Commonwealth and Empire State saluted as they met the cutter, and their passengers cheered the Prince. The little steamer Sylvan Shore, ignoring the etiquette, passed ahead of the Harriet Lane. It had been resolved that the party should land at the foot of 22nd street, whither the carriages had been ordered, but through a misunderstanding that point was left far behind before the cutter was brought to. Then there was another transshipping of the Royal party, and the Trumpeter conveyed them to the dock, where a landing was effected at 6 1/2 o'clock. Half an hour later the Prince was in his own apartments at the Fifth avenue Hotel preparing for dinner and for the ball."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1860/07/27/archives/deaf-mutes-in-california-persons-inter.html", "headline": "DEAF MUTES IN CALIFORNIA.

The San Francisco Bulletin has the following: \"Taking advantage of an invitation by one of the managers of the Deaf and Dumb and Blind Institution, we yesterday paid it a visit, and were so much interested by what we there saw, that we are induced to call the attention of the public to the subject, convinced that so soon as our readers generally are made aware of the existence of this school for the education of deaf mutes and the blind, they will contribute liberally to its support. It was only during the last session of the Legislature, that an appropriation of $10,000 was made for the erection in San Francisco of a suitable building for the accommodation of the deaf and dumb and blind. This will be done as soon as possible; but, in the meantime, a small house has been rented at No. 17 Tehama street, and here the school was first opened some six weeks ago. There are at present but nine pupils, four of whom are girls; but three more are to enter next week. These are all deaf mutes. They are under the tuition of Mr. CRANDELL, who is himself deaf and dumb. The class for the blind will be opened in a fortnight, a good teacher having been already engaged. Of these nine scholars four reside at the school, (two of them indeed have no other home,) while the remainder live with their parents or guardians in town.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/09/archives/instruction-for-deaf-mute-children-commerce-of-the-south-pavement.html", "headline": "Instruction for Deaf Mute Children.; Commerce of the South.

Of the character of this institution and its ability to provide for the benefit of this interesting portion of our community I am not well informed \ufffd but I am glad to see that the subject of giving early instruction to deaf-mute children is beginning to receive attention. It is one of great importance, and has been too long neglected. Myself, the father of an intelligent little deaf-mute child, who is now, to my great satisfaction, enjoying the benefit of early instruction, I am prepared to speak strongly and earnestly on this subject I have often wished to say to parents of deaf-mute children in our City and vicinity who are able and disposed to provide for them an opportunity of early instruction in a pleasant family school designed for their early education, that there is at Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a family school for little deaf mutes, kept by Mr. D.E. BARTLETT, an old and experienced teacher of the deaf, (formerly for many years connected with the public Institution for the Deaf and Dumb in our City,) a family school of the right kind \ufffd where the little folks are treated as such little ones need to be treated, and afforced opportunity of obtaining that development of their mental and moral susceptebilities which other children enjoy at home under the influence of kind and loving parents, brothers and sisters, but from which the isolated little deaf mute child at home is, deafness, excluded. Of the beneficial influence of this early training upon the mind and heart of the little deaf-mute, I could say much, as a loving parent would speak while watching the progress of a dear little one from a sad condition, of childish ignorance and inability to communicate with parents and friends, upward through growing intelligence and cultivation of manners, unfolding of intellectual and moral powers, until she comes to be an intelligent, communicative companion. A little soul emancipated from solitary silence and ignorance now restored to genial intercourse with kindred souls, loving and beloved. A philanthropic died, Mr.Editor, you will do by referring your readers who are interested in this department of juvenile education, to Mr. BARTLETT'S Family School for Deaf-mute children at Poughkeepsie, or to yours,23 Platt-street.NEw-York, Monday, March 5, 1860.To the Editor of the New-York Times:In a recent editorial on \"non-intercourse,\" &c., you are pleased to make some remarks about the South aspiring to become a manufacturing and commercial, as well as an agricultural community. Now as to manufactures, we will leave them for the future to test; but there are some in this region who have lived for a number of years in the belief that our commercial prosperity was already un fait accompli in fact, that the South was the commercial section of the Union. Therefore, when such well-informed journals as your own, patroni-ingly air opinions as to our future greatness, we are disposed to believe you are merely inclined to be facetious; should you really be in earnest, however, in asserting that the North preponderates commercially over the South, we would respectfully challenge you to a proof of that position.To us, the case seems to stand in this way: The exports of the South vastly exceed those of the North in value, as may be ascertained by reference to statistics easily obtained in your City, and unnecessary to be quoted here, as the assertion is admitted to be true by both North and South. But on the other hand, the North contends that the value of her imports more than counterbalance our export trade, and if we qualify the word by calling it \"imports from foreign countries,\" it will be incontestibly true; but when we consider that an immense portion of the goods imported by the North is thence reshipped to the South, and consequently, by her imported at second hand, we think the aggregate commercial transactions of the South, both exporting and importing, will be found to largely exceed those of the North. It may be urged that it is unfair to class these goods obtained by the South from the North as \"importations,\" inasmuch as they are both sections of one country; but suppose a dissolution of the Union were really to take place, without altering our commercial relations, would not those transactions be rightly called by us importations? Of course they would, and thefore the difference exists merely on paper, and to start such an objection is to quibble. We think we render the North full justice when we yield her the palm as the manufacturing section, par excellence, but must consider ourselves justly entitled to the front rank as a commercial community.To the Editor of the New-York Times:I have read with interest an article in your paper of the 25th inst., on \"The Best City Pavement,\" and agree with the writer in his statements, except that concerning the cost of iron pavement, as I am not of opinion that a durable iron block can be put down at so low a price as \"$4 50.\" The iron pavement in this City cost, for the first that was laid down, a little more than $10 per square yard. The last that was put down cost $6 per square yard. The first has been in use for about ten years, and is now in very good condition. The last was down but about four years, when it was found so badly broken and difficult to keep in place, and the street in such constantly bad condition, that it was removed, and the street paved with stone.Having given the subject of street paving my earnest attention for many years, I have arrived at conclusions as to the best materials and manner of producing a street pavement that would answer all the calls for comfort economy. &c.; and for which, after necessary experiments, I have obtained the favorable opinions of scientific and practical men, whose opinions may be found in a pamphlet which I herewith send you, and in which you will also see my manner of constructing said pavement.

A letter written by me concerning the \"Home for Deaf Mutes under twelve years of age\" is headed \"Impostors -- Rogus Charities.\" The heading is not mine, and I should have been far from applying any such terms to those connected with that Institution. The circular of the Institution contains the names of some most excellent people, who are far above engaging in any work which they do not believe to be best adapted to the end in view. But it is believed by many that they labor under a very great mistake concerning the law and the willingness of the managers of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum to receive children under twelve years of age, and it was in the hope that the matter would be clearly set before the public that the letter was written, and not with the remotest thought of casting a shade of reproach upon the managers of the \"Home.\" T.We are informed by responsible parties connected with this institution that our correspondent is in error as to the ability of the State Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb to receive and care for those young persons for whose benefit this Home is designed. At all events, the managers will very willingly hand over to them all their present inmates, together with forty or fifty more, similarly situated, whenever they will evince a willingness to receive them. It was personal experience of the inability to provide in this way for a large number of deaf and dumb children that led to the establishment of this Home, which is warmly commended to the favor of the public by a large number of the most respectable and influential gentlemen and ladies of this City.We have also received the following note upon the same subject:No. 9 WEST EIGHTEENTH-STREET, NEW-YORK, March 2, 1860.To the Editor of the New-York Times:Your correspondent \"T.\" has been led into several mistakes in relation to the \"Home for Young Deaf-Mutes,\" at No. 161 East Twelfth-street, and to the provision made for the education of those under 12 at the institution.

Since the late 1800s, the United States and European powers endorsed the just-war principle of distinguishing between combatants and civilians in war. And they supported as well the two complementary principles of \u201cproportionality\u201d and \u201cmilitary necessity\u201d in using force. (All three principles are pillars of the Department of Defense\u2019s Law of War manual.)Yet these principles were flagrantly violated when the United States bombed every city in Japan and Germany.

I have seen unbelievable changes during that time. Both Katie Booth\u2019s new biography on Alexander Graham Bell, \u201cThe Invention of Miracles,\u201d and Andrew Solomon\u2019s review (May 2) are missing the fact that deafness is very different now from when Bell was alive.The work Bell did was forward-thinking but difficult. When Bell was alive, hearing loss was not diagnosed until parents realized their children were not talking, and there were no hearing aids to help. Things are very different today.Now deaf newborns are identified at birth and can be fitted with hearing aids within weeks. They can begin to hear very quickly. If hearing aids are not providing enough benefit, they can receive a cochlear implant. They can then learn language the same way their siblings learn it, by hearing it spoken around them. They can attend school with siblings and have the same opportunities as adults. Parents can immediately communicate with them.More than 90 percent of children with hearing loss are born to hearing parents. If these parents want to learn sign language, it will take them a few years to become fluent, and during that time the child will not have good language exposure. (Think about learning a new language as an adult!)If children choose to learn sign language once they\u2019re older, they can.

But what a shame his work had to be filtered through the author\u2019s use of outdated tropes in her portrayal of deaf people and sign languages.Educators do not \u201cinvent\u201d sign languages. All languages, including sign languages, emerge from sustained interaction among a discrete community of users. Presuming that a sign language can be invented reinforces the misconception that sign languages are simple gestures; in reality they are complex linguistic systems equivalent to spoken languages. The Deaf Reach project is undertaking the further codification of Pakistani Sign Language, not inventing a new language.I was also dismayed to see the tired trope of \u201csilent\u201d deaf people: Does anyone really believe a school full of more than a hundred children is a place of \u201ccomplete silence\u201d?

That\u2019s as true for Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, as it is for the Islamic State. The Islamic State has executed, raped and enslaved civilians with impunity. And Mr. Assad has barrel-bombed, gassed, tortured and starved his own people into oblivion.The Islamic State must be held accountable for its crimes. So must Mr. Assad. In condemning the crimes of the Islamic State, you make strong moral judgments but draw immoral conclusions: Mr. Assad will never be an ally in the fight against terror. Like the Islamic State, he thrives on fear and sectarianism, capitalizing on the twisted extremism of a few to justify the mass slaughter of the many. That\u2019s why he avoids Islamic State targets on the battlefield, and funds its criminal enterprise by buying its stolen oil.The symbiosis between Mr. Assad and the Islamic State is on display right now in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, where Mr. Assad allows extremists to slaughter innocent refugees.To stop the Islamic State, we must stop Mr. Assad. This begins not in the courtroom, but on the ground. By imposing a no-fly zone we can protect ordinary civilians from the daily slaughter of Mr. Assad\u2019s vicious air forces, and create the conditions needed for moderate governance \u2014 the alternative to the Islamic State \u2014 to take root.Impunity for Mr. Assad won\u2019t stop the slaughter in Syria.

Added to that grim prospect is Egypt\u2019s threat of an invasion. The rapidly worsening situation for civilians demands emergency action to end the carnage, and the United States is well-situated to act as mediator, if only to achieve a truce that would allow humanitarian aid to enter Yemen.Tragically, President Obama has instead chosen to worsen the situation by removing the weapons freeze on Egypt and agreeing to send that country F-16 fighter jets, Harpoon missiles and kits for assembling Abrams tanks. The White House claims the decision was made in the interest of American national security, but it is hard to see how fueling a ruinous war, far from our shores, will make Americans more secure. We already have far more evidence than we need that wars lead to more hatred, misery and desperation \u2014 and too often to more wars.Rachelle Marshall, Mill Valley, Calif.

In short, the deaf community, like the hearing community, encompasses the range of human capacities, strengths and foibles.One constant in this tapestry of diversity, however, is the near universal inability of deaf people to be fully engaged participants in social situations dominated by the oral language community. As a child, I saw my smart, effusive parents reduced to cardboard cut-outs of themselves when they confronted the language barrier posed by the non-signing community. This barrier is cultural as well as physiological.American Sign Language, after all, is not a signed version of standard English. It is a discrete language with its own vocabulary, syntax and colloquialisms.Few would dispute that the acquisition and use of language are essential to the full development of human capacities.

But a misunderstanding about something I said led to a misstatement of fact in the article.I did not say that it is easier to learn any sign language if one reads and writes that language first. Sign languages, American Sign Language for example, do not have a written system. So, it is not necessary to learn a written system before learning A.S.L. or any sign language. Besides, English and A.S.L. are unrelated and different in terms of vocabulary, grammar and semantics; they are two distinct languages. It is almost like saying one could learn to speak French after studying how to read and write in Russian.Most educators believe, as I do, that a country's sign language can be learned before one acquires reading and writing mastery of the oral language in that country.

The article quotes a University of Connecticut linguist as saying, ''It's a very useful language because students who learn it can then communicate with a segment of the population that is right here in this country: the deaf and the hearing-impaired.''This needs clarification. If students learned American Sign Language they could communicate only with the half-million deaf who already know A.S.L. The major group with hearing loss, the 27 million who comprehend speech with amplification, do not know or need to know A.S.L., so the students couldn't ''sign'' to them. And they certainly couldn't communicate either with the rest of the United States population, or most of the rest of the world.To teach American Sign Language in our public schools as an equivalent to a foreign language makes no sense. The profoundly deaf numbered 892,000 in 1991, according to The Hearing Journal. This makes it by far the smallest of the major disabled groups: the 27 million hearing-impaired who can hear with amplification, the 16 million wheelchair bound, the 6 million blind.No doubt ''signing'' is dramatic in its visual aspects compared with hearing with various amplifying devices, compared with wheelchairs, compared with black glasses and a cane.

Nonsense. A.S.L. is used by about 500,000 people mostly to one another. Spanish, Italian, French, German, Polish, Chinese and the Philippine languages are spoken at home by people with difficulty with English, according to the World Almanac, in every case exceeding 500,000. A.S.L. is not even listed.The big D Deaf are highly visible so the popular misconception is that they represent the deaf world. They are 1 million of the 25 million hearing-impaired, about 4 percent. The impression is reinforced by the signers on television commercials, little-used captioning on video tapes, \"The Miracle Worker,\" \"Children of a Lesser God,\" the National Theater of the Deaf and the TDDs and TTYs in libraries.The real world of the deaf is the world of the hard of hearing, 24 million people, reclusive, made to feel ashamed of their disability so that a hearing-aid must disappear in the ear canal regardless of the sacrifice in quality of that miniaturization. For them getting along in the world of half-heard sounds and people who try once to communicate and then turn away is a persistent nightmare.Hope was born when the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 promised help on the Federal level in Post Offices and Social Security offices and Internal Revenue Service interviews. Never happened. Hope appeared again in 1990 when the Americans With Disabilities Act was signed.

Acres of them (for the 16 million wheelchair bound), but for the 24 million hard of hearing, nothing, nothing, nothing.One exception: In September the Connecticut Judicial Branch provided Personal Amplification Hearing Devices statewide for courthouse use, the first to do it.

This culture, with its own language and many cultural artifacts, fully justifies the Deaf pride of those who are its members.But Solomon has failed to give both sides of the perplexing, contentious and very complicated controversy between those who espouse oralism (i.e. emphasizing speech and lip reading) and the proponents of Deaf culture. Nowhere does he suggest that there are numbers of oral deaf adults who speak and lip-read well and who are competing successfully in the hearing world. Although no one knows what fraction of children born profoundly deaf can succeed orally, this is an option that parents of deaf children must consider.

There is a real bias in favor of using sign language that is based on the mixed results that were seen with the oral approach over the last 50 years. All that has changed.Your article does not acknowledge the strides that have been made in the manufacture of hearing aids and especially the cochlear implant. There have also been great advances in the ways in which deaf children are taught to speak and hear.My daughter is profoundly deaf. She was one of the first fortunate children to have a cochlear implant. She is mainstreamed in a hearing classroom, uses the telephone and enjoys music so much that she is studying piano. Her speech is clear and understandable. Her reading level is far in advance of her years.Ninety percent of deaf children are born to hearing families. The choice of whether to raise these children to sign or to speak is deeply personal. But today a choice exists.For the sake of other parents faced with a difficult decision, I wish that your articles on deafness would help provide the full picture.To a greater or lesser degree all deaf children can be taught to listen and to speak. The rate of success depends on many factors. Are there other handicaps involved? How much time and energy can the parents provide? Does your medical insurance provide for hearing aids?For the profoundly deaf, access now exists to the world of sound. The benefits are enormous. This in no way should keep anyone from learning to sign, but signing can be an additional means of communication, instead of the sole means.

They must now use special teletypewriters -- alone or in conjunction with a relay service -- to communicate via telephone. While the devices work well, they are relatively slow and do not necessarily transmit nuances of expression easily conveyed by spoken, lip-read or signed language. A videotelephone system would enable hearing-impaired people to communicate with one another, or with normal-hearing individuals, over a distance as easily as if they were in the same room. JOSHUA M.

For example, researchers such as Ursula Bellugi, Elissa Newport and Ted Supalla have shown that deaf children born to deaf parents learn the signs and structures of their parents' language as naturally and effortlessly as hearing children learn words from their hearing parents.Perhaps even more remarkable, my colleagues and I have found that deaf children born to hearing parents and not yet exposed to a conventional sign language still use their hands to communicate and, in fact, develop gestural communication systems that (while idiosyncratic to the child) have many of the structural properties of oral language spoken by children of comparable age.Specifically, these deaf children develop gestures that are strung together to form \"sentences,\" display rudimentary rules of syntax (ordering regularities and deletion patterns), combine gesture \"phrases\" in recurrent fashion to form \"complex sentences\" and even demonstrate evidence of regularity within individual gestures reminiscent of single-word morphologic structure.The gestural systems produced by these deaf children, although not so complex as the signs produced by deaf children exposed to a conventional sign language (such as American Sign Language), are far more complex than the spontaneous gestures of their hearing caretakers and more complex than the gestures produced by their hearing playmates of the same age.In general, David McNeill has shown that the gestures that hearing individuals (both adult and children) produce along with their speech represent meanings holistically, which are qualitatively distinct in form from the linear and segmented gestures produced by the deaf children we have observed. It is only when the hands are used as the sole means for communication that they produce an ordered and compositional system reminiscent of the systems that characterize spoken language.Dr. Petitto's work, then, can be taken in the context of a larger series of observations suggesting that language appears to be remarkably resilient to variations in input, blossoming in what might on the face of it appear to be a barren linguistic environment.

Six years ago, at the request of the children's librarian at the Mamaroneck Free Library, I began teaching a summer workshop in sign language for children ages 8 to 12 that has been repeated every summer since then. We require pre-registration and put a limit of 14 children on the class.There are always many children on the waiting list and often adults want to join the class. Motivation is high, homework considerable as I give the children many pages of pictured signs each week, together with directions as to how to make the signs, and the origin of the signs. Children will take the pages home to share with parents, siblings, family and friends.As a retired teacher of deaf children it gives me great pleasure to help bridge the gap between the deaf and the hearing in this manner and in this Westchester section of our world.

I choose which mode is best for me and which I do well.I do not sign and speak simultaneously, and when I chose to sign alone (with an off-camera voice) or to speak alone, as I did on the Oscar ceremony telecast (''Deaf Actress's Use of Speech Proves Divisive Among Her Peers,'' news story, April 13), I could have potentially ignored the two major segments of the deaf community - those who use speech and do not sign and those who sign and do not use speech.Fortunately, the telecast was closed captioned - with subtitles for viewers who have decoding devices - and everyone, regardless of communication preference, had access.So what's the big fuss? Your report that some ''see Miss Matlin's failure to continue using sign language while speaking during the awards ceremony as a blow not only to deaf people, but also to the goal of 'total communication' '' shows that you did not investigate fully. Otherwise, you would have noted that the broadcast was closed captioned and that I chose to do what I wanted to do.P.S. But thank you for the nice picture.

Approximately 17 percent of the population is considered to be sufficiently hearing-impaired to require a listening device. For viewing television, many require a decoder that prints the captions. However, their enjoyment of television is only realized if the networks elect to caption their programming.ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS should caption all their taped and live programming to meet the needs of all their viewers, not just those who can hear.

While it may be more exciting to cover events outside the metropolitan area, especially from the institution of the first artificial heart implantation in humans, I think you should know that in New York City single-channel cochlear prostheses have been implanted for at least a year.More recently, our cochlear prosthesis team has been implanting a multi- channel (22 electrodes) unit which theoretically renders more information to the auditory nerve.

The use of certified sign-language interpreters has been neither diverting during trials nor infringement on the secrecy of jury deliberations.The New York Society for the Deaf has for several years urged that the courts of New York permit otherwise qualified deaf persons to exercise their civil right to act as jurors. We are pleased that State Supreme Court Justice Budd Goodman has now taken the courageous step to permit this.Because, unlike ''legally blind,'' there is no such condition as ''legally deaf,'' we can only conjecture how many people who are ''hard of hearing'' have done jury duty with far less ability to comprehend the proceedings than a profoundly deaf person would have had with a sign-language interpreter beside him or her.The deaf community, usually not able to speak in its own behalf, appreciates the support of The Times on this issue.

My deafness is progressive and diminishes the quality of life, as I learned not long ago when I visited New York and attended three theater performances.Despite good seats in two of these shows, I could hear very little. In the third theater there was an infrared system that permitted me to hear every spoken word from the stage.In view of the increasing number of hearing-impaired people in this country, the installation of such a system in all theaters, movies, schools, churches and auditoriums would be a great step forward in assisting those with impaired hearing.I hope that the publication of this letter will alert the community to what can be be done for this ever-increasing problem. The initial investment for the installation of this equipment, especially in movies and theaters, can be quickly returned by charging a small fee for the use of the equipment, as is done at the Broadhurst Theater.It is time that the hearing-impaired are no longer shut out from the many cultural activities that are offered all over the country. A similar infrared system is available for installation in a home at a modest cost to enable the hearing-impaired person to enjoy television without turning the volume so high that it becomes an annoyance to others.

Hopes of the disabled population for increased physical and communication accommodations were not fulfilled.Just as aborted was the expectation that the general public and particularly government officials would become sensitized to the problems that attend the lives of the handicapped. v. e have found some increase in the awareness of individuals and agencies toward the needs of persons with disabilities, but one clear example of continued insensitivity is reflected in the enactment by the New York City Council of a law that compelled landlords to install an audible smoke alarm in each apartment by Jan. 1, 1982, and authorized a $10 charge to tenants. Our agency is now being flooded by complaints from deaf persons from who m $10 is being sought by landlords for a gewgaw that is of no value to them.The point is that when this law was proposed last summer, no city official or agency, not even the Mayor's Office of the Handicapped or the Human Rights Commission, thought of pointing out that these smoke alarms are useless to deaf persons and that smoke alarms designed to alert deaf persons are available. The alternative could well have been incorporated in the law.It is imperative that the law be changed immediately so that deaf persons receive the same protection as hearing persons. Insensitivity must not deprive our deaf neighbors of protection from the tragedy of fire. JOEL D. ZIEV LESTER J.

Do you like stories about underdogs, long shots or unsung heroes \u2014 athletes and teams that break barriers and defy the odds?This school year, the football team at the California School for the Deaf, Riverside, is steamrolling its opponents, electrifying a campus that has seen more than a few athletic defeats and humiliations.In this lesson, you will learn about how one high school team is shattering the stereotype that deafness is a deficit in football and sports. In a Going Further activity, we invite you to use the article as a model to tell the story of another athlete or team that has broken stereotypes or defied the odds.Warm-UpHave you ever played football? Do you find it a challenging sport to master?Before reading the article, consider that there are 53 players on a professional football team. What do you think it takes for them to become successful as a unit?Huddle up with a classmate and make a list of all the skills and qualities \u2014 athletic, social, emotional \u2014 that a football team needs to thrive and win on the gridiron.Next, review your list and consider the assets and the challenges a team might face if the entire roster was deaf.Then, consider one more question: Why do you think an all-deaf team in a small Southern California high school is steamrolling its competition?Questions for Writing and DiscussionRead the article, then answer the following questions:1. The article begins: \u201cThe athletic program at the California School for the Deaf, Riverside, has suffered its share of humiliations and harassment over the years.\u201d Which of these humiliations described in the opening paragraphs stood out to you? Why do you think Mr. Fuller, the writer, starts the piece by recounting some of the low points in the life of the Cubs football team?2. Mr. Fuller writes, \u201cFootball is a richly audible experience.\u201d How does he contrast typical high school football games with Friday night games at the Riverside campus?3. Coach Keith Adams\u2019s philosophy is that \u201cwhat might be thought of as a deficit can be an edge.\u201d Give at least two examples from the article showing how deafness is an asset rather than a deficit as a football player. Then compare the list of assets and challenges you created in the warm-up activity to what you learned in the article. Do you agree with Mr. Adams\u2019s philosophy? Does it resonate with your own experiences, in or outside of sports?4. Look at the photographs featured in the article: What story do they tell about the football team at the California School for the Deaf, Riverside, and the unique skills and chemistry that have enabled its success this season? What photo do you find most revealing or affecting?5. How has playing on the Cubs affected its teenage players, like Felix Gonzales? Compare their experiences competing in an all-deaf environment to previous ones in mainstream settings. Have you ever been part of a team or community that allowed you to \u201cblossom\u201d as many Cubs players have?6. What\u2019s your reaction to the story? What does it make you think or feel? Why do you think The Times published an article on a high school football team in Southern California? What inspiration and life lessons can you draw from it?Going FurtherOption 1: Write about a time when you defied expectations and odds.Have you ever been the underdog? David to a seemingly unbeatable Goliath? Have you ever been told you couldn\u2019t do or accomplish something because of your appearance, age, gender, race, identity or abilities? But you did it anyway \u2014 and succeeded?Write about a time when you faced great obstacles, challenged stereotypes or beat the odds, in or outside of sports. Describe your experience: What obstacles did you face and how did you try to overcome them? What skills and assets did you use and draw upon? How did you feel afterward? Did anyone support you along the way? Did you ever think of giving up? What did you learn about yourself and the world from the experience?Option 2: Read another inspiring story from the world of sports.Read another moving and uplifting article below from The Times\u2019s Sports desk. Then respond to the following prompts in writing or through discussion with a partner: What did you learn from the article? Which moments did you find most surprising, memorable or moving? What life lessons did you draw from the story? Why do you think sports is such a rich and compelling arena for inspirational journeys?In Mexico, an Indigenous Women\u2019s Softball Team Breaks BarriersTo Honor His Indigenous Ancestors, He Became a ChampionAthletes in a Ravaged Louisiana Town Try to Run Back to Normalcy\u2018Looking Back, I Am Glad We Played\u2019Cancer Nearly Took His Life. But the New York Marathon Awaited.Option 3: Tell the story of someone else who has broken barriers or challenged stereotypes.Imagine that The Times has hired you to write an article on an individual or group that triumphed in the face of adversity, from the world of sports or outside it. Whom would you profile and why? What questions would you ask? How might these experiences inform and engage readers of The Times? How can you celebrate the accomplishments of ordinary people in your family, school or community at a time when we could all use an uplifting story?Use the featured article as a mentor text to create your profile. Like Mr. Fuller, you might begin your story with past low points or struggles, and by using vivid language to capture what success looks and feels like. To round out your profile, you may want to include the thoughts and perspectives of the family, friends, teachers, coaches and fans.Brainstorm a list of questions you could ask to learn about your subject\u2019s experiences and accomplishment. For instance, you might ask: What obstacles did you face? How did you overcome them? What was most rewarding about your experience? What was most challenging? How did friends, parents, or coaches support you? What life lessons did you learn about yourself or the world? What advice would you give others who are facing similar barriers or tough odds?If you are working on this assignment as part of a class project, you may want to display your work with your classmates\u2019 and publish the profiles in the school newspaper or on the school website.Or you can submit your profile in our first-ever Profile Contest starting Jan. 5, 2022.Want more Lessons of the Day?

Credit...Adam Perez for The New York TimesRIVERSIDE, Calif. \u2014 Every once in a while a story comes along that prompts a reporter to drop everything, cancel appointments, forget the notion of a weekend, hug family members goodbye \u2014 and dash.For me that story was about a high school football team. Last week, I drove seven hours from my home in the East Bay to the California School for the Deaf, Riverside. I was not disappointed.After a long string of losing seasons, the football team was undefeated and, for the first time in the school\u2019s history, vying for the division championship. The article I wrote about the team, which is known as the Cubs, was published this week.When I arrived at the campus, the school\u2019s ebullient superintendent, Nancy Hlibok Amann, graciously gave me a tour. Through a sign language interpreter she told me about the team\u2019s coach.\u201cHis blood runs pigskin,\u201d she said of Coach Keith Adams.ImageThe team won by a score of 84-12.Credit...Adam Perez for The New York TimesThat evening Coach Adams and his players pummeled their opponents in the second round of the playoffs. The lopsided result was not a surprise. The Cubs had outscored their opponents, 642-156, during the regular season, lifting the spirits of a community hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.On Sunday I accompanied the players and coaches to the N.F.L. game between the Los Angeles Chargers and the Minnesota Vikings, where stadium announcers celebrated the Cubs\u2019 victories. Dressed in their red jerseys, they watched as their faces showed up on the enormous videoboard. Friends texted to say they had seen them on television.There are many explanations for why the team is doing so well this year \u2014 the particular cohort of players is very talented, swift and disciplined.

It was their world on their terms.When they were younger and played in hearing leagues, they were often put at nose tackle because the position required less communication. Now they played whatever position suited them best.\u201cThey have a very special bond, a chemistry,\u201d Amann told me. \u201cThey\u2019re able to read each other.\u201dI asked Laura Edwards, the athletics supervisor at the school, about the longstanding debate over whether deaf children should attend mainstream institutions or all-deaf schools.Edwards is deaf and was born into a hearing family. She told me that she recently brought an interpreter to a family gathering because she wanted to capture as many conversations as she could.\u201cGrowing up as a deaf person I never went to a deaf school,\u201d Edwards told me. \u201cIt was a struggle to make friends. It was very lonely.\u201dImageWide receiver Joshua Cypert, left, conferring with defensive tackle Xavier Gamboa.Credit...Adam Perez for The New York TimesAt the Riverside campus, Edwards says she watches deaf students who transferred from mainstream institutions blossom. \u201cThe communication barrier is eliminated and there is inclusion and social interaction.\u201d\u201cOur student athletes are the same as any other hearing students in terms of physical and mental skills and athletic talents,\u201d she texted me later. \u201cThe only difference is they are Deaf.\u201dEdwards noted that she had capitalized the word \u201cDeaf.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a typo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a culture of our own.\u201dThomas Fuller is the San Francisco bureau chief for The New York Times.If you read one story, make it thisDoing 300 minutes a week of moderate exercise may help ward off cancer.ImageLake Hennessey, a water resevoir for the city of Napa in June.Credit...Mike Kai Chen for The New York TimesThe rest of the newsA dip in water conservation: Californians have been asked to reduce water use by 15 percent, but new data shows just a 4 percent drop, The Associated Press reports.Boon for electric cars: The California Energy Commission approved a $1.4 billion plan to fund car charging stations or hydrogen refueling to help the state meet its climate goals, Reuters reports.Boosters for all: The Food and Drug Administration could authorize booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for all adults as early as Thursday.Biden withholds funding: Gov.

There was the time that a visiting team\u2019s volleyball coach mocked the deaf players. And another time a hearing coach for the girls\u2019 basketball team listened as opponents discussed how embarrassing it would be to lose to a deaf team.It did not help morale that the varsity football team, the Cubs, recently suffered seven straight losing seasons, leaving the school with the sinking feeling that opposing football teams came to the Riverside campus expecting an easy win.No one is disparaging the Cubs anymore. This season, they are undefeated \u2014 the highest-ranked team in their Southern California division. Through 11 games, they have not so much beaten their opponents as flattened them.On Friday night, the second round of the playoffs, the Cubs trounced the Desert Christian Knights, 84-12, a score that would have been even more lopsided had the Cubs not shown mercy by putting their second-string players in for the entire second half.ImageWide receiver Joshua Cypert, left, confers with defensive tackle Xavier Gamboa at Friday\u2019s game.Credit...Adam Perez for The New York TimesImageThe Cubs at halftime of their game on Friday. To the\u00a0players, team chemistry has been a key.\u00a0Credit...Adam Perez for The New York TimesLed by the school\u2019s physical education teacher, Keith Adams, a burly and effervescent deaf man whose two deaf sons are also on the team, the Cubs are a fast and hard-hitting squad. Wing-footed wide receivers fly past defenses, averaging 17 yards per catch. The quarterback doubles as the team\u2019s leading rusher, with 22 touchdowns on the season. A system of coded hand signals among tight-knit teammates and coaches confounds opponents with its speed and efficiency.With Friday\u2019s win, the Cubs are two games away from capturing the division championship for the first time in the school\u2019s 68-year history. But coaches and players say they already feel like winners.\u201cI sometimes still can\u2019t believe how well we played this year,\u201d Mr. Adams said after the win on Friday. \u201cI knew we were good, but never in my dreams did I think we would dominate every game.\u201dIn a part of California that suffered greatly during the pandemic with high unemployment and more than 5,000 dead, the Cubs\u2019 excellence has lifted the school and the surrounding community.Football is a richly audible experience: the crashing of helmets, the crunch of a tackle, teammates shouting from the sidelines and the roaring approval of the crowd. Friday night games at the Riverside campus are not totally silent, but they are not boisterous either. The generators that power the lights hum and the crowd reacts with scattered claps. But there is no public address system, no play-by-play commentator to call out players\u2019 names after a touchdown pass or run-stuffing tackle.ImageRunning back Enos Zornoza sprinted past a defender in Friday\u2019s game.Credit...Adam Perez for The New York TimesImageAssistant coach Ryan Zarembka with a group of players.Credit...Adam Perez for The New York TimesThe American flag flies near the field, but there is no national anthem before the game. A sign-language interpreter hired by the school serves as an intermediary between the Cubs\u2019 coaching staff and the game officials. Before the game on Friday, the interpreter reminded the officials to wave their hands when they blew whistles to stop a play.For the coaching staff, the success of the team has undermined the longstanding stereotype that deafness is something to overcome in football.Mr. Adams, who coached the team for two seasons starting in 2005 and began his second stint four years ago, attributes the turnaround to rigorous conditioning and an especially talented cohort of players, some of whom have played together for years at lower levels.He also has a philosophy that what might be thought of as a deficit can be an edge.Many teams try to use hand signals to call in plays, but they are no match for the Cubs, who communicate with a flurry of hand movements between each play. No time is wasted by players running to the sidelines to get an earful from the coaching staff. No huddle is needed.The coaches also say deaf players have heightened visual senses that make them more alert to movement. And because they are so visual, deaf players have a more acute sense of where their opponents are positioned on the field.After being defeated on Friday, Aaron Williams, coach of Desert Christian, said he had a warning for future opponents of the California School for the Deaf, Riverside.\u201cI would say be careful in thinking that you have an advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cThey communicate better than any team I have ever coached against.\u201dImageAssistant coach Kaveh Angoorani with Felix Gonzales after a touchdown.\u00a0Credit...Adam Perez for The New York TimesImageThe California School for the Deaf, Riverside, is the only all-deaf public school serving the southern half of the state.

And teachers and parents recount how students blossomed in an all-deaf environment.\u201cAbsolutely, this has changed his life,\u201d Ms. Gonzales said of her son. \u201cNow he is one of the stars.\u201dWith just 168 students at the high school \u2014 the institution runs from preschool through the 12th grade \u2014 the Cubs play in an eight-player league designed for smaller schools, often those in rural areas or private institutions.

The field is dimly lit with portable floodlights, each with its own exhaust-spewing generator, the kind of equipment that might be deployed by a night construction crew repaving an interstate.ImagePlayers can wear their jerseys with pride.Credit...Adam Perez for The New York TimesImageSenior Enos Zornoza.Credit...Adam Perez for The New York TimesWinning has made those conditions more bearable this season.

They noted that the school\u2019s top leadership included no people of color or deaf people.Two weeks later, the superintendent, Lisa Buckner, who has 22 years of experience as a teacher and administrator of deaf students and had most recently worked at the Education Department, resigned. The school has appointed an interim superintendent, who is also a white hearing woman, and is now searching for a permanent replacement.Since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last summer, institutions across the country have grappled with questions of representation and leadership, often propelled by community protests. At the school in Atlanta, the demands echoed a 1988 student uprising at Gallaudet University, the federally chartered private school for the deaf and hard of hearing in Washington.In that protest, which was viewed as a landmark moment for deaf people, students successfully pushed for the university\u2019s first deaf president and drew attention to longstanding challenges faced by deaf people.Activism since then, including a controversy that saw two board members at Gallaudet resign in 2020 while saying the school discriminated against Black deaf people in hiring and promotions, has increasingly evoked both race and disability. Three decades after the original Gallaudet protest, many in the deaf community say they are still fighting some of the same battles.The protests in Atlanta followed the hiring of Ms. Buckner in September. She replaced the former superintendent, John Serrano, who resigned in May after four years working as the school\u2019s first deaf Latino leader.The Atlanta school said it interviewed every applicant who met minimum qualifications for the position. Meghan Frick, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Education, said it \u201cstands opposed to audism and other forms of prejudice.\u201d She described Ms. Buckner as \u201can educational leader\u201d who was \u201cproficient\u201d in American Sign Language, or A.S.L.But current and former staff members say deaf employees and people of color were overlooked for promotions, and both staff and students have complained that Ms. Buckner\u2019s knowledge of A.S.L. was poor. In the original job posting, sign language fluency was listed as a preferred, not required, skill.ImageTrinity Arreola was inspired to speak out against audism and racism at the Atlanta Area School for the Deaf by earlier protests at Gallaudet University.\u00a0Credit...Kendrick Brinson for The New York TimesMany student protesters felt like the new superintendent could not understand them and looked down on them, according to Trinity Arreola, 18, a protest leader.\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re going backward,\u201d Ms. Arreola, a senior and the president of the Latino Student Union, said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re going back to a time where deaf people were thought of as limited and incapable.\u201dThe school\u2019s top leadership consists of white hearing women filling the roles of superintendent and assistant principal. In the 2020-21 school year, 79 percent of teachers were white and 60 percent of teachers were hearing, according to Education Department data. Ms. Buckner declined to answer questions about her decision to resign or complaints from students and staff.Since May, at least 12 other employees have quit the school. Many of those who quit were deaf, people of color, or both, according to one former agriculture teacher, Emily Friedberg, 50, who is white and deaf.After 12 years working at the school, she said, she was pushed to quit in June \u2014 months before she found out who the new superintendent was \u2014 because of what she described as a \u201chostile\u201d environment driven by white hearing leadership that she said \u201cbullied\u201d deaf staff and made inappropriate remarks about students of color.Ms. Frick said the Education Department was not aware of incidents like these at the school. She said officials encouraged anyone with concerns to reach out to the Education Department leadership.ImageEmily Friedberg took a job at the Texas School for the Deaf in Austin, Texas, after leaving Atlanta Area School for the Deaf over what she described as a hostile work environment with audism and racism.Credit...Sergio Flores for The New York TimesThough the Gallaudet protest paved the way for new education and employment opportunities for the deaf, schools for the deaf are still mostly led by hearing people and are seldom led by people of color who are deaf.Of the 73 school leadership positions for 71 statewide K-12 schools for the deaf across the country, 46 are held by hearing people, according to Tawny Holmes Hlibok, a professor of deaf studies at Gallaudet. Among the 27 deaf school leaders \u2014 a number that she said has more than doubled from seven years ago \u2014 three are people of color.Growing research shows that students perform better in school if they have role models who reflect their background.\u201cI notice that when I talk to deaf children at a school without a deaf leader and ask them what they want to be when they grow up, they often limit themselves,\u201d Professor Hlibok said, adding, \u201cWhen I ask them if they want to be a teacher or lawyer or nurse, they say they can\u2019t because that job is for a hearing person.\u201dA 2019 report by the National Deaf Center found that 44.8 percent of Black deaf people and 43.6 percent of deaf Native Americans are in the labor force, compared with 59 percent of white deaf people.Along with a lack of role models, many deaf students, particularly deaf students of color, are not adequately prepared for college because of a lack of early language support services and a lack of certified educational interpreters in public schools, said Laurene E. Simms, interim chief bilingual officer at Gallaudet.Black deaf students obtain undergraduate, master\u2019s or Ph.D. degrees at about half the rate of Black hearing students, and half the rate of white deaf students, according to another 2019 report by the National Deaf Center.The loss of so many people of color on the Atlanta school\u2019s staff has made many students feel less comfortable there, according to Katrina Callaway, 19, a senior. In the past, she said, she and her friends have confided in teachers who they can relate to about their problems, home lives and friends, but now \u201cstudents don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anyone they can open up to,\u201d she said.ImageKatrina Callaway said students felt less comfortable at  the Atlanta School of the Deaf after the loss of several people of color from the staff.Credit...Kendrick Brinson for The New York Times\u201cWhen I try to open up to someone who hasn\u2019t had the same experiences,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not always sure if I can trust them, and I feel a lot of self-doubt.\u201d She said that sometimes it seemed that white staff treated students differently based on their skin color.More broadly, activists in recent years have complained about the \u201cwhitewashing of disability,\u201d or how much it is largely seen through a white lens, despite statistics that show Black people are more likely to have a disability.For example, media portrayals of those with disabilities and leadership of disability organizations skew white, according to Vilissa Thompson, a Black disabled activist who created the hashtag #DisabilitySoWhite on Twitter to draw attention to the issue.Recently, Netflix\u2019s \u201cDeaf U\u201d reality series focusing on Gallaudet College students was criticized for its lack of deaf women of color, even though less than half of the school\u2019s students were white at the time.Those broader issues raised the stakes at places like the Atlanta school.Ms. Frick said the Georgia Department of Education was working to create leadership pathways for teachers and school staff.Mr. Serrano, the previous superintendent, declined to comment on his experience with the Education Department, but he wrote in an email that he hoped the department would conduct an equitable and inclusive search for the next superintendent.\u201cIt is my firm belief that students want and need a leader who \u2018looks like them\u2019 and who shares their experiences as deaf and hard of hearing individuals,\u201d he wrote."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/movies/lauren-ridloff-eternals-deaf-hero.html", "headline": "How Lauren Ridloff\u2019s Deafness Became a Superpower in Marvel\u2019s \u2018Eternals\u2019", "date": "2021-09-15T09:00:12+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "The assistant director was concerned.They were about to do something very loud (no spoilers!) on the outdoor set of Marvel\u2019s \u201cEternals,\u201d and this foolish woman didn\u2019t want earplugs.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked.Well, if I\u2019m wrong, this is definitely going to be a first, thought Lauren Ridloff, an actress who has been deaf since birth.

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.How did you land this role?I brought my son to an audition \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you what for! \u2014 and the casting director saw me and wanted to cast me for something else. Then a few months later the casting director reached out to my manager and said, \u201cWe want to consider Lauren for a Marvel film, and I can\u2019t tell you what it is.\u201d I was like, \u2018Wait, this is Marvel, seriously?\u201d My first thought was maybe it would be \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Then I got the call that the director of the movie wanted to meet with me, so I dropped everything and came to L.A. Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and [executive producer] Nate Moore broke everything down and asked if I was interested, and my immediate answer was yes.In the comics, Makkari is a hulking, hearing white dude. Were they specifically looking for a nonwhite, deaf, female actor?To be honest, I don\u2019t know much about how they made that decision. But I love that they decided to make Makkari everything he\u2019s not in the comic books \u2014 he\u2019s a huge guy, let\u2019s find someone tiny. He\u2019s blond, let\u2019s find someone who has Black hair. He\u2019s a man, let\u2019s go with a woman. He\u2019s hearing, and now the character\u2019s deaf.What did you have to educate people about as far as working with deaf actors?When people learn they\u2019ll be working with deaf actors, they think \u201cShe needs an interpreter,\u201d but they often don\u2019t realize they need to think in terms of resources and support, too.ImageAs Hollywood\u2019s understanding of representation grows, Ridloff said, \u201cwe need to have deaf writers and creative talent involved in the process of planning film projects from the beginning.\u201dCredit...Amy Harrity for The New York TimesWhat were some of the logistical challenges on set?In some scenes, I had to face a wall. As a deaf person, how do you cue me? At one point, I was sharing my frustration with Angie \u2014 Angelina Jolie \u2014 at a holiday party after a day of shooting. And she immediately made a suggestion \u2014 why don\u2019t we use a laser pen that special effects can easily erase? It was an \u201cAha, wow\u201d moment. Whenever I\u2019m looking at a wall, the interpreters would use a laser pen to make a circle on the wall \u2014 \u201crolling, rolling, rolling\u201d \u2014 and once it went away that meant, \u201cAction!\u201dWere you comfortable asking for what you needed?I got to set believing that I had to show how easy I am to work with as a deaf person. I was concerned about seeming too fragile. But after working with others, I realized everyone has their own unique set of challenges, and that I need to think about what I need to deliver as an actor, and don\u2019t apologize for it.What should Hollywood do to be more inclusive of deaf actors?Hollywood is finally figuring out why it\u2019s so important to have representation, and now it\u2019s more about how. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s more tricky. We need to have deaf writers and creative talent involved in the process of planning film projects from the beginning. When you have deaf experts within and on the stage, from the crew to makeup artists, it feels like that naturally leads to more authentic representation onscreen.What about for deaf audiences?Hollywood needs to take the lead on subtitling ads, trailers and those cute little interviews with clips that celebrities do promoting their movies. Another thing I\u2019d like to see improve is the specifics of audio description. It\u2019s not enough to see \u201cmusic is playing\u201d in a scene \u2014 what kind of music is it? Happy? Scary?Are most movie theaters accessible to people who are deaf?No! We\u2019re an afterthought in movie theaters, and that needs to change. You have to use a special closed-captioning device to watch subtitling in a theater, and it\u2019s a headache, because most of the time the devices don\u2019t work. Then you have to go back to the front desk and find somebody to help, and by the time they figure it out that it\u2019s not working \u2014 that it\u2019s not going to be subtitled at all \u2014 the movie\u2019s halfway done. Then you get, \u201cWell, how about I give you a free ticket for the next movie?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d That doesn\u2019t fix the problem.Do you feel pressure to pave the way for future deaf actors?I\u2019m not going to lie, I do feel the pressure and stress sometimes, and that can be a burden. I have to remember that it\u2019s not my job to inspire others, or to be a model \u2014 but what I do have is the ability to create those connections.What do you hope people take away from this film?Growing up, I didn\u2019t dream about becoming an actor. I didn\u2019t see myself on the screen. As a little girl, I thought I was one of only a few deaf people walking on this Earth. Now, as an adult, I\u2019m aware there are at least 466 million deaf people and hard-of-hearing people out there. I\u2019m not the only one. And that\u2019s what it means to have a deaf superhero \u2014 a lot more people will see a lot more possibility."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/30/insider/sign-language-names-deaf-culture.html", "headline": "How a Question on Sign Language Led to a Deeper Look at Deaf Culture", "date": "2021-08-30T09:00:13+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.How does a person get a name sign \u2014 the series of unique gestures used to identify someone in American Sign Language? For a team of Times journalists, the process of answering that question underscored the importance of two storytelling basics \u2014 rely on experts and think of the audience \u2014 and resulted in an interactive article in July that provided a broader understanding of deaf culture.\u201cOne of our priorities was to show our readers the diversity of experiences and backgrounds that exist in the deaf world,\u201d Ilaria Parogni, a senior editor who wrote the article, said. \u201cDelving into name signs allowed us to tap into that.\u201dThe challenge began when The Times set out to learn how Vice President Kamala Harris received her name sign (also known as a sign name).Name signs are an important component of \u201ccapital D Deaf\u201d culture, a term used by some deaf people to indicate that they embrace deafness as a cultural identity. The signs consist of gestures that can reflect facets of an individual\u2019s personality, physical features or background.A group of five women had collaborated on a name sign for Vice President Harris after agreeing that her Black and Indian heritage should inform her name.Scott Reinhard, a graphics editor, originally pitched the idea to the Culture desk and suggested talking to the women about how they arrived at the name sign. Ms. Parogni and Alicia DeSantis, a deputy editor for visuals and multimedia, organized a two-hour video call with the five women in February. Ms. Parogni has family members who have experienced hearing loss and had previously written stories about on-screen representation of deaf and hard-of-hearing characters on television.But, she said, \u201cI\u2019m always conscious that I\u2019m not a member of the Deaf community.\u201d So she consulted ASL teachers throughout the project, asking for advice on sensitive subjects like the best way to indicate that someone is speaking ASL in an article. She also shared insights with the team that she gained from her experiences reporting and researching the subject.The Times worked with several interpreters throughout the project, consulting with an interpreting agency that assisted in selecting translators who would cater to the needs of people from different backgrounds. \u201cDiversity was important to us,\u201d Ms. Parogni said. \u201cBehind the scenes, too.\u201dMs. Parogni said that it quickly became clear to everyone that there was a much bigger story to be told beyond Ms. Harris \u2014 about the history of name signs and their significance to deaf people.It was clear, too, that video, graphics and design would have to be integrated in order to tell the story in a fully accessible way. Overall, more than a dozen journalists worked on the project, including Deborah Leiderman, a senior editor who was involved from the beginning. She helped produce the project and edited the written component. Ms. Leiderman also had worked with Ms. Parogni on previous articles about deaf people.Meg Felling, an assistant video editor, edited the videos and created subtitles based on the interpreters\u2019 translations. She did not know ASL, so she looked up signs to avoid cutting someone off in the middle of a sentence as she was making edits. Still, there were questions the team had to work through.\u201cInterpreting isn\u2019t an exact science,\u201d Ms. Parogni said. \u201cSo, for a certain word, we\u2019d often have to go back to the source to be 100 percent sure.\u201dAmanda Morris, a hard-of-hearing woman raised by two deaf parents who is fluent in ASL, offered additional support when she joined The Times in June as a disability reporting fellow.\u201cIt made a huge difference,\u201d Ms. Parogni said. \u201cNot just to have someone who could look at subtitles and make sure the ASL was right, but also confirm we were approaching the project in the right way.\u201dMs. Morris helped make a few of the subtitles more accurate. \u201cSigns can look very similar,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to use multiple context clues such as facial expressions and body language to figure out what a person is saying.\u201dThe team also took her recommendation to make a key detail in the story more prominent: Name signs cannot be assigned by a hearing person. And Ms. Morris reinforced a direction team members had decided on earlier to make the article accessible to visually impaired readers by including video transcripts \u2014 invisible descriptions of videos on a page that are read aloud to blind or visually impaired users on a screen reader.Ms. Morris said she hopes all of these efforts will help educate readers about deaf people and show \u201cthat sign language has deep cultural significance.\u201dWhat Matters in a Name Sign?We look at the origins of name signs in deaf culture, including one recently assigned to Vice President Harris."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/books/review/new-this-week.html", "headline": "New & Noteworthy Poetry, From Sign Language to Robot Saints", "date": "2021-04-20T09:00:07+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Recent poetry books of note:INDEX OF WOMEN, by Amy Gerstler.

The tweets (along with Gurba\u2019s excellent negative review of the book, on Tropics of Meta ) renewed a debate about cultural appropriation. What I noticed most, though, was Gurba\u2019s voice, both swaggeringly jestful and pain-soaked. A year later, I read Gurba\u2019s coming-of-age memoir, MEAN. It was as wrathful and hilarious as her Twitter account. But I was surprised by its simultaneous tenderness \u2014 for instance, in this gorgeous passage about Gurba\u2019s childhood best friend: \u201cWe met in kindergarten, and I loved her when I was 5, I loved her when I was 6, I loved her when I was 7, I loved her when I was 8, I loved her when I was 9, I loved her when I was 10, I loved her when I was 11, I loved her when I was 12, and I loved her when I was 13.

He had a deaf mother and a deaf wife, but he worked relentlessly to normalize their deafness, hoping that they might become such clever facsimiles of hearing people as to be spared the disadvantages of their manifest disability.In his later life, Bell was loosely associated with eugenics, perhaps the most misguided of all Victorian ideologies. He never advocated for deaf people to be sterilized; in fact, he opposed such practices. But he did try to persuade deaf people not to marry one another, because he feared that they would pass on their disability and create a \u201cdefective variety of the race.\u201d He recruited prominent figures to his side, including Helen Keller, who dedicated her first memoir to him, and who initially understood herself the way he understood her: as an inspirational but broken human being. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a man wanting to marry me,\u201d she said. \u201cI should think it would seem like marrying a statue.\u201dKatie Booth\u2019s biography of Bell, \u201cThe Invention of Miracles,\u201d has been in the works for 15 years; her meticulous research and rigor are evident on every page. Engagingly written, the book enlivens a life that has often appeared dry in other accounts. Booth\u2019s descriptions of Bell\u2019s passionate courtship of his student Mabel Hubbard, who belonged to a much higher social class, are as stirring as a romance novel, and her narrative of his work on the telephone reads like a thriller. One comes away feeling deeply connected not only to Bell, but also to Mabel and a host of subsidiary characters.Born in Scotland in 1847, Bell was the son and grandson of elocutionists, and his driving passion was to understand how human beings create the sounds that make up speech. He produced a speaking machine that replicated a range of phonemes when properly aerated, and continued to tinker with ways of bringing forth spoken words where no such words had been heard before; he even tried to teach speech to his dog. His father had designed a universal alphabet to represent the mechanics of articulation, and Alexander Graham Bell lectured widely on its importance, certain that anyone would be able to verbalize any language transliterated into these symbols.That anyone included deaf people. Bell believed that with the correct methods, they could learn to speak, and be integrated into the larger society. As he tried to understand hearing and sound, he stumbled into inventions. Though the telephone made him rich, he had relatively little emotional attachment to it, seeing it as a distraction from his wish to reform the education of deaf people. (Nevertheless, he devoted years to defending his patents, which some critics believe were granted unfairly; if Bell did invent the telephone, he stood on the shoulders of giants.)Mabel had lost her hearing as a child, a consequence of scarlet fever, after learning some speech, and she was able to master verbal communication anew. Bell believed that others would share her aptitude if properly taught. But he did nothing to lift the stigma that even she associated with her condition; Mabel long refused to socialize with other deaf people because to do so \u201cinstantly brought the hardly concealed fact [of my own deafness] into evidence.\u201dBell seems to have been disconnected from most human drama; the man Booth describes sounds as though he may have been on the mild end of the autism spectrum, as many great inventors are. She believes he was lonely in his later life, rather a sad man, but the evidence she presents suggests he was merely a loner in his intellectual adventures and, Mabel notwithstanding, not much drawn to intimacy. His mind was fixed on the human voice, and everything else came second, including his own family. That detachment perhaps explains the failures of empathy that poisoned his relationship with the very people he wished to serve. Mabel said: \u201cYour deaf mute business is hardly human to you. You are very tender and gentle to the deaf children, but their interest to you lies in their being deaf, not in their humanity.\u201dImmune to the beauty of sign language, Bell never saw deafness as anything more than a deficit, though already in his day deaf people were organizing around the defense of their language and society. The oralism Bell championed was a disaster for the deaf. While examples abound of deaf people who have mastered speech, they do not represent the larger deaf community; an acuity at producing sounds is a splinter talent. Moreover, instructing deaf people on the mechanics of speech is terribly time-consuming, and those who aspire to this skill can do so only by ignoring all other domains of education. Deaf people in a signing environment are likely to learn mathematics and science and literature, while those raised orally learn pronunciation and little else. Finally, oralism implicitly teaches a kind of self-abnegation \u2014 that deaf people are of value only insofar as they can approximate another kind of person. Devoted oralists believed that sign language should be forbidden in oralist environments, which meant that language acquisition in oralist schools was painfully gradual. Without early language development, as Booth notes, the human mind cannot fully develop, and many children taught orally acquire little or no language during the crucial window of brain plasticity.There is no question that deaf people who master speech have access that other deaf people don\u2019t have. But Booth is at pains to point out that such people are not necessarily happier than those who live in the segregated world of the signing deaf. Not only did Bell\u2019s educational strategy threaten to obliterate an exquisite deaf culture with its own language and traditions, but also, it didn\u2019t work: Only about 10 percent of deaf people who received an oral education ended up functioning comfortably in the hearing world.Booth is doubly outraged: at what Bell wanted to do and at the psychic cost of the method by which he proposed to do it. Her book is a partisan rallying cry fueled in part by her experience of having two deaf grandparents. \u201cWhen my grade-school social studies book said that Alexander Graham Bell was the inventor of the telephone, it sounded as absurd to me as introducing Adolf Hitler as a vegetarian who once ruled over Germany,\u201d she writes. It\u2019s an arresting comparison, but it doesn\u2019t take into account that Bell\u2019s humanism, though often misguided, was of an entirely different nature than Hitler\u2019s monstrosity. Everything Booth says in this eloquent biography is backed up persuasively, but her yearning to correct the record should be balanced against the uncorrected record that has obtained previously. Though she attempts to wave the flag of impartiality, she is deeply invested in indicting her subject.ImageCredit...Simon and SchusterBell, Booth complains, was incapable of recognizing \u201ca larger struggle between normalcy and difference, between saving and being saved, between empowerment and charity\u201d \u2014 a struggle that very few people recognized in his day. He \u201cwould start playing God,\u201d she writes of his efforts to stop intermarriage among the deaf, \u201ctrying to control birth, trying to bring about an end to deafness.\u201d She often sounds irritable, even smug, about Bell\u2019s shortcomings. \u201cBell never saw the deaf community as a valuable one,\u201d she declares. \u201cHe believed, against all evidence, that social cures for deafness had to be found by integrating the deaf with the hearing; he believed that deafness was inherently lonely. But it was Bell to whom loneliness clung, even if his greatest effort was to lift it.\u201dBell was emblematic of a larger Victorian movement to normalize that we reject today only incompletely. In the current moment of racial reckoning, with assimilation out of fashion, Bell\u2019s proposals look ugly, but one must consider that even now, many people who have differences and disabilities would prefer to fit in. That doesn\u2019t invalidate their lived experience, which may be rich in ways that others fail to recognize or even imagine; it merely reflects the social pressure toward homogeneity that has become ever stronger since the Industrial Revolution. We can keep fighting that pressure, as the disability rights movement does, but new normalizing procedures are being invented all the time.Booth\u2019s prologue and afterword concern her deaf grandparents and her own experience in the signing world, and she maintains that the trauma her family endured was Bell\u2019s legacy. I am with Booth in hoping that visionaries such as Bell do not succeed in narrowing the range of what it is to be human, that they don\u2019t destroy whole cultures. Language extinction is an urgent problem of our era; by the end of the century, half the languages currently spoken will have vanished from use, and only the heroic effort of a relatively small group of committed linguists will preserve any record of them. American Sign Language is more robust than many endangered languages; it is taught in major universities even to hearing people who may have no immediate need for it.Bell\u2019s wish that everyone understand everyone else came at a terrible price, but it was the product of its time. Booth\u2019s anger reflects a current trend of holding people from the past to standards of the present. In her afterword she is critical of the cochlear implant, which has effectively achieved what Bell set out to do. Children with implants should, as Booth argues, have access to sign in case they don\u2019t process sound fluently. But most children who receive them are \u201cnormalized\u201d into their parents\u2019 mainstream culture, thus diminishing the population of functionally deaf people. That\u2019s all that was needed; deaf culture went on the chopping block the minute an obliterative procedure was developed. Now that Bell\u2019s dream has come true \u2014 albeit with a different intervention than the one he championed \u2014 we have to consider Booth\u2019s impassioned biography as part of a larger battle, valiant but probably unwinnable, against cultural erasure and standardization."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/movies/paul-raci-sound-of-metal.html", "headline": "How \u2018Sound of Metal\u2019 Star Paul Raci Went From Day Jobs to Oscar Nominee", "date": "2021-03-31T17:26:17+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "It\u2019s been a long time coming for Paul Raci, who just earned his first Oscar nomination at age 72.\u201cTo be an actor for all these years \u2014 40 years of just knocking around \u2014 and then to have this kind of acclaim, it\u2019s insane, man,\u201d Raci said recently in the backyard of his Burbank home.For most of his career, Raci has had to make do with one- or two-line roles in TV shows like \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and \u201cBaskets.\u201d Then the \u201cSound of Metal\u201d director Darius Marder plucked Raci from obscurity and handed him the part of a lifetime: Joe, the stoic but sensitive leader of a sober-living community for deaf people who takes in a troubled punk-metal drummer, Ruben (Riz Ahmed).It\u2019s a role with real-life resonance for Raci, who grew up in Chicago as a CODA \u2014 a child of deaf adults \u2014 and, like Joe, dealt with addiction issues after serving in Vietnam. \u201cI always say I went into Vietnam like John Wayne, and I came out Lenny Bruce,\u201d Raci said.A lifetime spent as his parents\u2019 hearing interpreter had instilled in Raci a love for performance, but when he moved to Los Angeles decades ago to pursue an acting career, roles were scarce. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time and I\u2019ve always known what I was capable of, but nothing was happening for me out here,\u201d he said.Still, Raci kept plugging away, working by day as a sign-language interpreter in the Los Angeles County Superior Court system and, at night, continuing to hone his craft in stage productions at the Deaf West Theater. \u201cI would always think to myself, \u2018I must be so specific that there\u2019s nothing around here for me,\u201d said Raci, who is small and wiry with tattoos and rocker-length hair. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019ve got to wait for that specific role.\u2019\u201d And then it finally came.These are edited excerpts from our conversation.ImageRaci as a sober-community leader in \u201cSound of Metal,\u201d starring Riz Ahmed and Olivia Cooke.Credit...Amazon StudiosWhat was the morning of the Oscar nominations like for you?Well, I don\u2019t have an alarm clock \u2014 I have a head clock, and for some reason it was unplugged that morning. I was supposed to get up at 5 a.m., and at 5:25 a.m., my wife and I got up: \u201cOh, we missed it!\u201d We run in the living room, turn on the TV and just as it came up, they were on the second guy from the supporting-actor category. And then [presenter Priyanka Chopra Jonas] goes, \u201cAnd Paul Rah-ci.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s Ray-ci \u2026 and I accept!\u201dSo now it\u2019s 5:30 in the morning, my phone starts ringing. People are showing up with wine, they\u2019re showing up with edibles \u2014 not the kind you\u2019re thinking about, but fruit covered with chocolate, and cupcakes. My friend Hillary, she brings over a bottle of champagne \u2014 I said, \u201cIt\u2019s six o\u2019clock, Hillary!\u201d My wife is crying, my daughter is crying. It stayed like that all day long, so it was quite exciting.And what was it like after the dust settled?Six days later, I looked at my wife and I said, \u201cDid this really happen?\u201d But if I had to wait this long for this moment, it\u2019s worth it, man. A very good friend emailed me two days ago and said, \u201cPaul, this is not just a supporting-actor nomination, this is a lifetime achievement award.\u201d I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, but I got a lot of work left to do here. I think this thing has added 20 years to my life.For decades, you had been doing day-player work in movies and television. How did you make those kinds of roles feel worthwhile?To be honest, it\u2019s more of a detriment than anything, because it just shows you what an abysmal failure you are in your own head. I mean, I wasn\u2019t able to get a series-regular audition or to even get in the room because, \u201cThey need a name.\u201d Thank God for Deaf West Theater \u2014 if it wasn\u2019t for them, where the hell else was I going to exercise my acting chops? I had nothing. But you go from gig to gig and hope that something\u2019s going to happen.So how did it finally happen? When you auditioned to play Joe in \u201cSound of Metal,\u201d did you have an inkling that this time might be different?I put it on tape, sent it in and then forgot about it \u2014 because listen, this never happens for me. When I leave an audition with the sides [script pages] in my hand, I rip them up, throw it in the garbage. I\u2019m not going to dwell on stuff that\u2019s going to break my heart. But my wife, who\u2019s my agent, called the casting directing office and said, \u201cHave you seen Paul\u2019s tape?\u201dAt that point, they said: \u201cWe\u2019re inundated with tapes. We\u2019ve got too many that we can\u2019t even find Paul\u2019s tape, and we\u2019re probably going to go with a name.\u201d Robert Duvall, Forest Whitaker, that\u2019s what they were looking for, name-wise. My audition tape was fairly strong, and my wife said, \u201cPlease, look for it.\u201d Ten minutes later, the phone rings. The casting office goes, \u201cDarius wants to talk to Paul.\u201d A week later, he drove down to meet me and we talked and talked.ImageA friend told Raci to consider his nomination a lifetime achievement award: \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, but I got a lot of work left to do here.\u201dCredit...Michelle Groskopf for The New York TimesIt must be great to have a wife who fights for you in that regard.Listen, she\u2019s been a small-time agent here for over 20 years, trying to compete with CAA and ICM. She has a boutique agency and she said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to close it until you\u2019re a star, Paul.\u201d She was always fighting to get me in a room, and it never happened. My mind-set was so stuck in rejection that even at the end of my conversation with Darius, I said, \u201cHold on a second, are you actually offering me the role?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d But at first, I told them I wasn\u2019t going to do the movie.Why not?Look, I got a house to pay for here. This is not the big movie I thought it was \u2014 it was a very small budget, and I could make more money staying here in L.A. and working in the court system than what they were offering me. I\u2019m going to go all the way over there [around Boston] for something that\u2019s going to put me in the hole? I can\u2019t afford that \u2014 I don\u2019t even have health insurance for my family. So I said to my wife, \u201cTell Darius I\u2019m not interested.\u201dReally? That takes guts.Well, it looked like a pretty good movie, but I\u2019m a blue-collar guy like my dad and I\u2019ve got to pay my bills. Then Darius calls me: \u201cYou can\u2019t do this! You don\u2019t understand what this means.\u201d So they kind of bumped up my per diem. He was so flexible with me, and I knew his heart was in the right place \u2014 he was so respectful to my point of view, to my CODA experience, that I felt like I could trust him.After subsisting for so long on these minor roles, how did it feel to play out such long scenes opposite Riz Ahmed?Wonderful. Fulfilling. I\u2019ve had many of those moments in a 99-seat theater, but to be able to have this captured on film is incredible to me. And to be a scene partner with somebody with Riz\u2019s brilliance is a dream come true. In our very first scene, when he\u2019s sitting across from me and I say, \u201cSo, how are you doing,\u201d he\u2019s in so much pain and he just sits there, taking a very long moment. And that was real! He just breaks my heart.I\u2019m forever grateful to Riz Ahmed \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I could have done it with another actor, because it was so intense. In our last scene together, I looked over in the periphery of my eye when they called \u201cCut,\u201d and Darius Marder was standing there just weeping.Image\u201cYou go from gig to gig and hope that something\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Raci said.Credit...Michelle Groskopf for The New York TimesThough you\u2019re a child of deaf adults, you\u2019re also a hearing person. Is there a case to be made that Joe should have been played by someone who is deaf or hard of hearing?That\u2019s an argument that some would make in the deaf community, yes. However, I would argue back, because I\u2019m a CODA and you cannot take me out of this culture that I was brought up in. I would never take a deaf role from a deaf actor who is culturally deaf, but Joe is a guy who was late-deafened.I\u2019m sensitive to it, and I vetted it before we went ahead. I asked Darius in the beginning, \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable having this guy be deaf. Can\u2019t you make the guy a CODA?\u201d He said, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. Let me get back to you.\u201d He had three deaf advisers on the set, and all three told Darius, \u201cNo, it\u2019s more compelling to have him be deafened,\u201d to have that parallel line between Ruben and Joe, which you feel so strongly.The beautiful thing about it is I\u2019m hooked into [\u201cSound of Metal\u201d distributor] Amazon right now, and they\u2019re coming to me and asking for content. I have other things I\u2019ve written, I have other deaf writers I know of, and because of this connection, I think some doors are going to be kicked down, because people are interested in what I have to say right now.Have you figured out what your next project will be?Listen, I have \u201cTeam Paul\u201d now. I\u2019ve got a management team, I\u2019ve got an entertainment lawyer, and Team Paul is now advising me that I have to be very careful with the next role I take. I\u2019ve been offered \u2014 honest to God \u2014 about eight, nine, 10 things. And I\u2019ve never been offered anything ever! I can\u2019t wait to get started working again, but I\u2019m going to have to be a little selective and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.Are any career goals now in sight?I love Bill Murray, he\u2019s the same age as me. I don\u2019t want to take any roles away from Bill, but I certainly would like to act with that guy. I used to fantasize and meditate on things like that, things I thought were too good to be true, because for many years my prayer has always been, \u201cNothing is too good to believe in. It can happen.\u201d Even though there was a part of me didn\u2019t even believe that, the prayer believed in me and lifted me up. You\u2019ve got to just persevere, even when the believing isn\u2019t in you. If it\u2019s true for me, it\u2019s true for everybody."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/t-magazine/american-sign-language-asl-deaf-culture.html", "headline": "American Sign Language Finds Its Spotlight", "date": "2021-03-25T12:00:11+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "LAST AUGUST, several months into lockdown, Raven Sutton posted a short clip on TikTok. In it, Sutton, a 25-year-old Black Deaf dancer living in Washington D.C., covers Cardi B\u2019s song \u201cWAP\u201d in American Sign Language, or A.S.L., which she\u2019s used, alongside English, her entire life. Wearing a tan crop top and hoop earrings, Sutton signs Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s verse, maintaining coy eye contact with her camera as she reimagines lines like \u201cGobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me\u201d for a Deaf audience. Sutton, of course, can\u2019t \u201chear\u201d the music in a conventional sense. But having danced since childhood, she\u2019s found ways to channel her intuitive feel for rhythm through the vast, lexically complex language of sign, paying close attention to the vibrations of the bass pounding through her speakers or holding an eight-count so she knows when the words begin. Sutton posted the 35-second video and then closed the app for a few hours to get on with her day. She returned to thousands of likes, comments and, eventually, a retweet from Cardi B herself.For hearing audiences, long dismissive or at least ignorant of A.S.L. and its bountiful possibilities for creative expression, the video piqued curiosity. Some asked if Sutton was really Deaf, so exacting was her choreographed interpretation. Others, Sutton told me in a video call moderated by a sign language interpreter (as all interviews for this article were conducted), wondered why she signed the song\u2019s titular refrain several different ways, once connecting both hands to make a V shape, another time gyrating her hips back and forth. Such questions were expected, given how widely misunderstood American Sign Language remains, more than 200 years after it was enshrined as the language of the Deaf. It is not merely English in gestural, transliterated form, as hearing folks often assume, but a visual language no less grammatically and syntactically evolved than any other, whose descriptions and sentence constructions utilize space and time multidimensionally. Sign tends to set the scene, placing the relevant characters in a given sentence in spatial relation to one another, much like stage directions. Further distinguishing it from English is A.S.L.\u2019s topic-comment structure, in which the object of a sentence is often introduced before it\u2019s described: If someone wishes to say they \u201cliked a book\u201d in sign, they\u2019d mention the book before they do their feelings about it. For Sutton, the song\u2019s irreverent hook could take numerous shapes in A.S.L., depending on the context. \u201cThere\u2019s a part where Megan is, you know, talking about different types of \u2026 \u201d she says with a laugh, hesitant to invoke the song\u2019s title. \u201cBut she\u2019s talking about different scenarios, right? She\u2019s talking about him paying off her college, she\u2019s talking about taking pictures on his phone.\u201dSince going viral, Sutton has continued to use TikTok both to showcase her dance and to educate her large contingent of hearing followers, placing her among a wave of Deaf creatives who, consigned to their homes during the pandemic, are leveraging their popularity to advocate for Deaf awareness and, by extension, a greater understanding of sign language in the culture at large. \u201cDigital communication methodologies have been something that Deaf people adopted very quickly,\u201d says Carrie Lou Garberoglio, 41, director of the National Deaf Center in Austin, Texas, where the first-ever A.S.L.-accessible video game, a choose-your-own-adventure called Deafverse, was developed in 2019. Early on, Deaf people embraced teletypewriter (TTY) technology and emojis, and they\u2019ve long relied on the internet to foster intracommunity rapport. As social media has proliferated, it\u2019s functioned as a conduit for these efforts, allowing Deaf folks to bypass the gates of institutional power that have traditionally held them back.Image\u201cTranslating Interpreting\u201d (2021), the second work made by Kim to accompany this essay.Credit...Photo by Stefan KorteBut one does not have to be online to witness this upsurge in Deaf content and sign language representation, itself both a part of and distinct from the groundswell of stories about differently abled people that have arisen over the last decade. After years on the margins, the Deaf community is experiencing a series of firsts: a Deaf contestant on the latest season of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d; Marvel\u2019s debut Deaf superhero, Makkari, played by the Tony-nominated actress Lauren Ridloff in \u201cThe Eternals,\u201d out later this year; and the record-breaking $25 million sale of the film \u201cCODA,\u201d short for Child of Deaf Adults, to Apple Studios after its rapturous reception at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival. Even state-by-state coronavirus briefings, which have made minor celebrities of the sign language interpreters relaying life-or-death information to viewers, have shone a light on A.S.L. and the myriad ways Deafness is sidelined. Last fall, in the first case of its kind, the National Association of the Deaf successfully sued the Trump administration for failing to provide an interpreter at its Covid-19 briefings. Meanwhile, less than a week after the inauguration, President Biden\u2019s press secretary announced that an interpreter would be present at all of the administration\u2019s daily press conferences, a first in presidential history. For several years now, these breakthroughs have seemed imminent, a matter not of merit but of opportunity and resources. But it\u2019s no coincidence that they\u2019re all coalescing now, following a time of pandemic, protest and social upheaval that\u2019s provoked frank conversations about access and equity, and also a mass migration to our screens, wherein the visual has supplanted the auditory, imbuing our attempts at understanding each other with a renewed sense of urgency and empathy. All of us, living under circumstances so inhospitable to genuine human connection, have adopted new modes of engagement; from that, there\u2019s emerged a recognition that language need not be the exclusive provenance of sound or even text but of signs, too.In conversations with many of the Deaf community\u2019s foremost creatives and de facto activists, there\u2019s a sense of both enthusiasm and wariness, a desire to bridge the gap between the Deaf and hearing worlds and an equally strong sense of exhaustion, accumulated over time, at the patience such a merger would require. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says the 40-year-old Berlin-based visual and sound artist Christine Sun Kim, \u201chearing people don\u2019t know what to do when they encounter a Deaf person, and we end up having to communicate their way.\u201d The animating spirit of much of Kim\u2019s work, particularly her series \u201cTrauma, LOL,\u201d recently on view at the Fran\u00e7ois Ghebaly gallery in Los Angeles, is a sense of enervation at this cycle, of \u201chaving to explain and explain and explain to people who are not Deaf, and who are kind of creating more work for us.\u201d Though art institutions have been more hospitable since Kim was named a TED Fellow in 2013, and included in the Whitney Biennial six years later, she\u2019s often found herself justifying the need for an interpreter or feeling infantilized by curators who imply she\u2019s just lucky to be included. \u201cWe have to protest more just to get basic needs met,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it were completely up to me, I wouldn\u2019t want to be an activist.\u201dOver generations of gradual but often arrested progress, the Deaf community has remained self-sufficient, justifiably suspicious of the intercessions of hearing people. As a result, there is a sense of proprietorship about A.S.L., fortified when they see it mocked or commodified. It was only eight years ago that Deaf people watching Nelson Mandela\u2019s memorial service saw their language bastardized by a sign language interpreter whose gestures were convoluted and unintelligible. Now, according to a 2018 report by the Modern Language Association, A.S.L. is the third-most commonly studied non-English language in American higher educational institutions, after Spanish and French, and across the internet one can find scores of instructional videos taught by hearing people, a reliable if bothersome metric by which to gauge the language\u2019s mainstreaming. \u201cOftentimes, it\u2019s not even accurate \u2014 facial expressions, body movements, location, hand shapes, all of that is important when you\u2019re teaching,\u201d says Sutton, who attended Washington, D.C.,\u2019s Gallaudet University, the country\u2019s first and only liberal arts college for the Deaf. \u201cWhat they end up doing is using our culture and our language for clout.\u201dImageKim\u2019s \u201cDeaf Traumas\u201d (2020).Credit...Photo by Paul Salveson. Courtesy of the artist and Franc\u0327ois Ghebaly, Los AngelesTO UNDERSTAND THESE misgivings, one must know the history of sign language, which is characterized by sharp vicissitudes of embrace and oppression. Sign language arrived in America by way of France, where, in the mid-18th century, under the auspices of the religious educator Abb\u00e9 Charles-Michel de l\u2019Ep\u00e9e, it became the primary mode of instruction for the French Deaf. Until then, sign language had existed as a kind of informal mixture of the community\u2019s Indigenous signs with French grammar. De l\u2019Ep\u00e9e, upon encountering two Deaf girls and watching them communicate, found that the Deaf, then seen as ineducable, were in fact adroit students, so he began applying a more sophisticated structure to their native hand signals and gestures. His methods were formalized in 1760, with the founding of the first free school for the Deaf, later to be known as the National Institution for Deaf-Mutes in Paris. \u201cThe abb\u00e9 de l\u2019Ep\u00e9e was not the inventor or creator of this language,\u201d wrote Pierre Desloges, whose 1779 account of that period reflects the spirited beginnings of Deaf enfranchisement. \u201cQuite the contrary, he learned it from the Deaf; he merely repaired what he found defective in it.\u201dAfter de l\u2019Ep\u00e9e\u2019s death in 1789, this effort was carried on by the grammarian Roch-Ambroise Cucurron Sicard, known as Abb\u00e9 Sicard, a mentee of his who would usher in what Oliver Sacks, in his seminal book \u201cSeeing Voices\u201d (1989), called \u201ca sort of golden period in Deaf history,\u201d whereby sign language was recognized as the \u201cnatural\u201d language of the Deaf, not a mere childlike form of pantomime. Sicard would eventually meet Thomas Gallaudet, an American educator who helped establish, in 1817, what would become the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Conn. What followed was a cross-pollination \u2014 between French sign language and the systems of home sign that already existed in American towns with large Deaf populations, like Chilmark, Mass., on the western edge of Martha\u2019s Vineyard; Henniker, N.H.; and Sandy River Valley, Maine. Ultimately, these disparate strains of sign would merge to create American Sign Language.But soon after Congress, in 1864, authorized the creation of the first federally chartered Deaf institution for higher learning, which would become Gallaudet, prominent oralists like Alexander Graham Bell, following in the tradition of the educational reformer Horace Mann, advocated for deaf assimilation through speech and lip reading. Bell himself had a fraught relationship with Deafness that preceded his telephonic innovations: Both his mother and wife were Deaf, and he saw their impairments as something to be eradicated, going so far as to speak out against Deaf intermarriage in an 1883 speech at the National Academy of Sciences.For Bell\u2019s part in thwarting sign language education and undermining Deaf culture, Kim considers him to be the community\u2019s greatest historical scourge, a conviction that inspired the site-specific mural at Washington University in St. Louis that she unveiled this past February. A 25-foot-tall work that imagines three variations of Deaf-specific afflictions, titled \u201cStacking Traumas,\u201d features musical notes placed atop one another, referencing a collective indignity. The first is \u201cDinner Table Syndrome,\u201d or the difficulty of holding court in hearing settings. The second reads \u201cHearing People Anxiety,\u201d an agita born from navigating the chasms between Deaf and hearing people. At the topmost rung is \u201cAlexander Graham Bell,\u201d his name looming over the others, a hurdle to be cleared.VideoNetflix\u2019s soapy look at the lives of several undergraduates at Gallaudet University, the country\u2019s first and only liberal arts college for the Deaf.CreditCredit...Courtesy of NetflixTHIS PAST FALL, Netflix released the first season of the docu-series \u201cDeaf U,\u201d a soapy look at the lives of several undergraduates at Gallaudet, executive produced by the 31-year-old Deaf actor Nyle DiMarco, who graduated from the university in 2013. If the series appears at first like your garden-variety campus reality show \u2014 complete with love triangles, unwanted pregnancies and daddy issues \u2014 it\u2019s those qualities that make the show\u2019s existence remarkable, radical in its familiarity: Alongside the spectacle of young-adult melodrama is a sense of gravitas, a thread from past to present, for Gallaudet is to the modern Deaf movement what Stonewall was to gay rights. There, in the spring of 1988, the student body successfully protested to demand the resignation of its hearing president and the installation of the school\u2019s first Deaf leader.By depicting the familiar theater of college life through sign, \u201cDeaf U\u201d doubles as a rigorous look at A.S.L. in practice, and the social stratification that\u2019s entrenched within it. The generationally or prelingually Deaf, with their mastery of sign language, sit at the highest rungs, while some students are seen as not Deaf enough, particularly those who wear hearing aids or cochlear implants. There\u2019s Alexa, the white daughter of Deaf parents and Gallaudet graduates, whose pedigree puts her among the school\u2019s Deaf \u201celite,\u201d and two of the young men she dates, Rodney and Daequan, both of whom are Black and partially hearing, prompting frank conversations about the fence-straddling this requires of them within a cloistered ecosystem. While filming, the mostly Deaf production team would often call a pause, moving from one unremarkable conversation to a juicier one being held elsewhere. \u201cA lot of our language is based on the face,\u201d DiMarco says. \u201cIt\u2019s a subtle movement or twitch of the eyebrow \u2026 so it was [crucial] that Deaf people behind the camera could pick up on those nuances.\u201d During one scene, we see Alexa, seated on a bench in the campus courtyard, crane her neck around to make sure no one is in eyeshot before asking Daequan if he got her pregnant on purpose, signing the words down by her lap, as if to whisper.One byproduct of \u201cDeaf U\u201d is a better understanding of these idiosyncrasies, embedded in every language but often overlooked in A.S.L., which must contend with the assumption of its inscrutability. Language, its prescriptive parameters drawn by the hearing, has long been considered the domain of sound but, as Kim explains in her 2015 TED Talk, sound \u201ccan be felt tactually, or experienced as a visual or even as an idea.\u201d It was not until 1960, with the publication of the linguist William Stokoe\u2019s monograph \u201cSign Language Structure,\u201d that A.S.L. would recover from the deleterious effects of the oralist movement and be treated academically as a bona fide language. In the six decades since, as Deaf people were once again encouraged to communicate in their native language, there has emerged an understanding of Deafness not as a handicap but as a veritable culture, which, in turn, has nurtured an embrace of its primary exponent: sign language. But it\u2019s no accident that this is happening at a time when all American language, signed or not, is expanding and evolving \u2014 look, for instance, to the ways in which Black, Latino and queer vernaculars have filtered into common parlance.ImageKim\u2019s \u201cWhen Grammar Mood\u201d (2020).Credit...Photo by Paul Salveson. Courtesy of the artist and Franc\u0327ois Ghebaly, Los AngelesThat\u2019s why there is something revolutionary about all the A.S.L. content on TikTok, where videos are often supplemented with captions and viewers are just as likely to encounter a brief tutorial in sign language as they are a video of a Deaf person using it at a drive-through. The app functions as a kind of permanent archive of a visual language that is by nature fundamentally untranscribable, and thereby always at risk of erasure. At the beginning of her videos, the 22-year-old Texas-based Nakia Smith dabs lotion on her hands, a habit one might liken to throat clearing. Smith, part of the fourth generation of Deafness in her family, instructs her followers in the intricacies of Black American Sign Language, a dialect she describes as \u201cA.S.L. with seasoning,\u201d or broadcasts the failures of accessibility \u2014 videos without captions; classrooms without interpreters \u2014 that still blunt Deaf integration.After a video of Smith and her grandfather sharing the history of B.A.S.L. went viral last October, Netflix got in touch, and she and the streaming service began a social media partnership, the first clip of which shows Smith explaining the segregationist roots of B.A.S.L., the dialect historically used in Black Deaf circles. Smith, like many Black signers, code-switches between A.S.L. and B.A.S.L., depending on the person with whom she\u2019s speaking; users of B.A.S.L., she explains, will place their signs around their foreheads rather than their torsos, and where A.S.L. often uses only one hand, B.A.S.L. employs two. That so little linguistic scholarship of the dialect exists today is the consequence of both audism and racism. But last summer\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests, which included Black Deaf folks among its prominent participants, has galvanized the cause of Black Deaf studies, prompting recent scholarship, as well as pushes for inclusion, including the establishment earlier this year of the Center for Black Deaf Studies at Gallaudet, and the release of various video campaigns foregrounding the movement for Black Deaf empowerment.Smith and others use their growing platforms not only as a loudspeaker but as a form of preservation. But how does one safeguard a visual language whose complexity is distorted by the written word? These issues are especially salient in theater, since videos of A.S.L. productions protect only the footage itself, not the words being signed. For this reason, the 41-year-old New York-based Deaf playwright Garrett Zuercher writes in both English and A.S.L., a laborious if not atypical process to which he\u2019s become accustomed. \u201cMy whole experience has been bilingual, which is very common in the Deaf community,\u201d he says.ImageKim\u2019s \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner (Third Verse)\" (2020).Credit...Photo by Paul Salveson. Courtesy of the artist and Franc\u0327ois Ghebaly, Los AngelesWhen the pandemic first began, and live performances migrated to online platforms, Zuercher noticed that even filmed theater, outfitted with closed captions for hard-of-hearing viewers, was inadequate. Though many Deaf creators speak to the incidental virtues of the quarantine-born explosion in video conferencing \u2014 their interpreters can log on instead of traveling, and the last several years have seen marked improvements in the availability of subtitles and assisted-listening technology \u2014 that medium, too, can undermine the multiplicity of signed communication. A few weeks into lockdown, Zuercher and several others in the Deaf theater community convened remotely to watch Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d (1979). All Sondheim aficionados, they noted how often the closed captions failed to account for the overlapping density of his dialogue and libretto. \u201cIt felt like a watered-down version of Sondheim,\u201d Zuercher told me.Soon after, he and his friends, including Ridloff, decided to put on their own reading of \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d this time in sign, an endeavor that functioned like a restoration: The calculated cadences that had been lost in the subtitles were made clear visually. The group put on another two shows \u2014 \u201cCompany\u201d (1970) and \u201cInto the Woods\u201d (1986) \u2014 and with that, a theater collective, now known as Deaf Broadway, was born, a kind of East Coast counterpart to the 30-year-old Deaf West Theatre in Los Angeles. While closed captions are an invaluable asset to hard-of-hearing viewers, the effects of enjoying a production in one\u2019s native tongue were invigorating. One mother got in touch with Deaf Broadway to let them know that though her hearing children were fans of the 2014 film adaptation of \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d it was not until seeing the signed iteration that her Deaf child connected with it, too. To Zuercher, \u201cthat is proof that captions don\u2019t do it \u2014 access in sign language is what really provides understanding.\u201dSO, TOO, DOES seeing oneself onscreen, though for the 17-year-old Pennsylvania-based actor Millicent Simmonds, those moments of recognition have always been scarce. When Deaf characters have been depicted onscreen, they\u2019re often played by hearing actors; even in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d for which the Deaf actor Marlee Matlin received an Academy Award in 1987, dialogue in American Sign Language is frequently obscured by the film\u2019s editing. It\u2019s this history that\u2019s motivated Simmonds to see her own work \u2014 which includes roles in \u201cWonderstruck\u201d (2017), \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d (2018) and its sequel, to be released later this year \u2014 as a corrective. Without sign language, she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with my own family, I wouldn\u2019t have communication.\u201dVideoFor the film, directed by Darius Marder, the actor Riz Ahmed learned sign language.CreditCredit...Courtesy of Amazon StudiosThis process of coming to recognize Deafness as a way of life, rather than a lesser one, likewise unfolds in the recent film \u201cSound of Metal,\u201d directed by Darius Marder and starring Riz Ahmed, who learned sign language for the role. About halfway through the film, Ahmed\u2019s character, Ruben, who has lost his hearing after years spent touring as a heavy metal drummer, decides to get a cochlear implant, a neuroprosthetic device that stimulates the auditory nerves to create the sensation of hearing. But among his cohabitants at the Deaf commune where he spends much of the film, this procedure is seen as an affront. \u201cEverybody here shares in the belief that being Deaf is not \u2026 something to fix,\u201d his mentor tells him.Therein lies an enduring ideological divide that \u201cSound of Metal\u201d broaches but doesn\u2019t adjudicate. Instead, the film makes an argument for a life lived richly, with sign language but without sound. Deafness is not sanitized of hardship; having spent countless hours in audiology consultations myself on account of my own hearing deficit, I can say Marder deftly captures the essential alarm and shame of that ordeal, particularly as Ruben first experiences sound as it\u2019s communicated through his implant, somewhat garbled and motorized, not like he remembers. But neither is Deafness pathologized, as it so often is onscreen, or equated with a kind of sensory or spiritual impoverishment.To help faithfully represent the Deaf experience, Marder enlisted Jeremy Lee Stone, 32, who has a minor role in the film and taught Ahmed sign language at the actor\u2019s Brooklyn home. Their initial conversations had to do with Deaf identity, \u201ccapital D, relating to the culture and history, versus lowercase D, meaning deaf in the medical sense,\u201d as Stone distinguishes it. Gradually, he submitted the actor to a rigorous process of A.S.L. instruction, wherein Ahmed had to, as Stone says, \u201cremove his identity and become a different character.\u201d At a cafe, when Stone and Ahmed were practicing sign language and a waiter came by to take their orders, Stone would not let Ahmed speak on their behalf, making him order his drink just as his character would. \u201cI wanted him to experience \u2026 that frustration of not being able to communicate clearly, the misunderstanding that happens,\u201d Stone says.As we spoke via Zoom, I asked what he thought was the most common misperception about A.S.L. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then \u201cone sign is worth a million,\u201d he eventually answered, though Stone realized immediately that the adage did not truly demonstrate the vitality of what he refers to as a multidimensional language, through which meaning, concepts and behaviors that might require several sentences to describe verbally can be expressed with the flick of a wrist, a furrow of the brow, the body acting as a proscenium before which one can stage an infinite number of scenes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe,\u201d he added. Then he thought better of it and showed me instead."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/arts/television/deaf-tv-representation.html", "headline": "As More Deaf People Are Seen on TV, Others Want to Be Heard", "date": "2021-01-27T15:00:11+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "While filming the reality series \u201cDeaf U,\u201d Rodney Burford wasn\u2019t too focused on any effect he and his cochlear implants would have on viewers. \u201cIn my own mind I was like, \u2018Yo, I\u2019m really on Netflix,\u2019\u201d said the 22-year-old cast member of the show, which zooms in on a group of students at Gallaudet University, the nation\u2019s only liberal arts university devoted to deaf people.Things changed after the show debuted last fall. Parents of cochlear-implant users started reaching out to say how seeing Burford on the screen had made an impact on their children. \u201cSo I would say, no question, I\u2019m proud,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI am very proud.\u201dMany deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals have welcomed the increase in visibility that deafness and hearing loss have enjoyed on TV lately. The current season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d on ABC, features Abigail Heringer, who is believed to be the first deaf contestant and cochlear-implant wearer on the show; the actress Angel Theory, who is hard of hearing, currently stars on \u201cKinderf\u00e4nger\u201d on Facebook Watch and plays Kelly, a character with hearing loss, on AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d; and Disney+ has announced that a Hawkeye series in development would feature a deaf Native American actress, Alaqua Cox, as Echo, a deaf Native American superhero.But for many who use devices like cochlear implants or hearing aids, onscreen representation still falls short by not reflecting enough of their experiences. Jessica Flores, a comedian in San Francisco who wears cochlear implants and grew up in a hearing environment, speaks English and uses sign language (which she learned later in life). Yet, she pointed out, deaf characters tend to be portrayed onscreen as people who sign and don\u2019t speak.ImageMatt James with Abigail Heringer, in a recent episode of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d Heringer is believed to be the first deaf contestant and cochlear-implant wearer on the show.Credit...Craig Sjodin/ABC\u201cDeaf U,\u201d which follows students on campus as they date, party, gossip and flirt, was praised for showing a diversity of experiences, including those of hearing-device users like Burford. But Gallaudet, which is in Washington, as an institution places emphasis on  learning sign language and interacting with other people who are deaf and hard of hearing \u2014 experiences that not all people with hearing loss have.\u201cI have not seen really any perfect representation of my type of deafness\u201d on TV, said Alexandra Dean Grossi, who received a diagnosis of profound hearing loss at age 2 and wore hearing aids before switching to cochlear implants as a teenager; she attended hearing schools and, like Flores, had speech therapy, but never learned to sign.Growing up, the few deaf actors Grossi saw, like the Oscar-winning Marlee Matlin, used sign language and were usually part of the \u201ccapital D Deaf\u201d community \u2014 a term used by those who embrace deafness as a cultural identity and communicate primarily through American Sign Language. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel that that represents the hard of hearing and cochlear implant experience very well,\u201d said Grossi, a software designer for the IBM accessibility team.Grossi, who has also worked as a production assistant and junior writer in Hollywood, expressed frustration at the misconceptions around the experiences of those who are deaf and hard of hearing \u2014 especially those of people who live primarily in hearing environments.When she has tried to pitch shows that featured deaf protagonists whose experiences resembled her own, she said she would often get the feedback that the character was not deaf enough. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, that\u2019s the whole point,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s so much nuance that you\u2019re missing.\u201dAs a teenager, Flores felt the absence of thoughtful representation. She spent years \u201cbeing like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m alone,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to understand me,\u201d she remembered thinking.ImageSeeing someone you can identify with on TV \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s like giving us a big hug,\u201d said Jessica Flores, left, a comedian who has a YouTube channel.Credit...via Jessica FloresThat is, until Flores came across Amanda, who also wore hearing aids, in a 2008 episode of MTV\u2019s \u201cTrue Life\u201d documentary series. (Flores has had cochlear implants for only two years.)Flores teared up, she recalled; seeing Amanda gave her hope and the awareness that there were others like her.Flores, who had little contact with the \u201ccapital D Deaf\u201d community, discovered the power of cultural representation after she started a YouTube channel on which she discusses hearing loss.  People started messaging her, sharing how much they identified.\u201cIt was a really emotional moment,\u201d Flores said. Seeing someone you can identify with on TV, she added, can have a similar effect. \u201cThat\u2019s like giving us a big hug.\u201dAshley Derrington, a blogger for Hearing Like Me, a platform devoted to hearing loss, also experienced that when seeing Heringer on \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s one of the first speaking deaf people that I\u2019ve seen in mainstream media, so it highlights that deaf does not just mean sign language,\u201d said Derrington, who is hard of hearing and communicates verbally.\u201cI don\u2019t personally identify with just the \u2018capital D Deaf community,\u2019 but I don\u2019t identify with just the hearing world,\u201d said Derrington, who was fitted with hearing aids around age 2. \u201cI\u2019m just sort of like the outsider that has associations to both worlds.\u201dShoshannah Stern, an actress and writer who grew up in a deaf family, uses hearing aids and communicates verbally, said in an interview, \u201cThere are so many stories within the deaf community, so many experiences to be represented.\u201dStern said that she wanted to \u201cpush back against the expected version\u201d of stories about deaf people as defined by hearing creators. That led to \u201cThis Close,\u201d a Sundance Now show in which both lead characters are deaf but have different upbringings, and which shows them interacting with people in both the hearing and the deaf worlds. She created the show with Joshua Feldman, who is also deaf.Image\u201cI have not seen really any perfect representation of my type of deafness\u201d on TV, said Alexandra Dean Grossi, who is working on developing her own show about a deaf protagonist with cochlear implants.Credit...Peter AskimWhen working on \u201cThis Close,\u201d Stern said, she felt it was important to incorporate the experiences of its cast members who played the deaf or hard-of-hearing characters, including one who wore cochlear implants.In search of more representation, others are also taking matters into their own hands. Grossi has written a concept for a dramedy based on her experiences. Flores plans to establish her own company aimed at empowering deaf creators in the industry.\u201cThe idea of control within storytelling is complicated,\u201d noted Stern, who has appeared in the shows \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d \u201cWeeds\u201d and \u201cSupernatural.\u201d \u201cAs an actor you only have so much.\u201d That is what pushed her to start writing in the first place.For those seeking better on-screen representation of deaf and hard-of-hearing experiences, it\u2019s ultimately about validation. \u201cWe are all humans,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cWe want to reach out. We want to connect.

Rosenblum, the association\u2019s chief executive, said in an email. \u201cAccurate captioning helps anyone and everyone. Appropriately assigned interpreters at press briefings avoids possible misunderstandings.\u201dReached for a response to the lawsuit, which was filed on Monday in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the White House referred inquiries to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.The N.A.D. said in a statement that deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans \u201care often left behind with the latest updates and actions the U.S. government has taken to address this pandemic.\u201d Live captioning on television can be unreliable, the association said, especially for those whose primary language is A.S.L.In the United States, more than 37 million adults, or about 15 percent of people 18 and over, report some trouble hearing, according to the National Institutes of Health. For many who are deaf or hard of hearing, the pandemic has already made life more complicated.The lawsuit states that \u201cA.S.L. is a complete and complex language distinct from English, with its own vocabulary and rules for grammar and syntax \u2014 it is not simply English in hand signals.\u201dThe governors of all 50 states have provided in-frame sign language interpretation for their public briefings, according to the lawsuit. \u201cAll but a small handful continue to do so consistently,\u201d as have other world leaders and the mayors of major cities across the nation, the lawsuit says.\u201cPresident Trump, however, does not,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cHe now stands alone in holding televised briefings regarding the Covid-19 pandemic without ever having provided any A.S.L. interpretation.\u201dMr. Rosenblum noted that up until May 13, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York used a sign language interpreter only in the online streams of his daily coronavirus briefings, not in the television broadcasts.\u201cThis rendered the television broadcast inaccessible for those who rely on A.S.L. and do not have internet access,\u201d Mr. Rosenblum said.Mr. Cuomo added the interpreter to the broadcasts only after he was compelled to do so by a federal judge in response to a lawsuit filed by Disability Rights New York, an advocacy group.As far as the White House briefings are concerned, Mr. Rosenblum said on Tuesday that \u201cevery day there is a delay puts more and more deaf and hard of hearing people at risk.\u201d\u201cAccess cannot be an afterthought,\" he said. \u201cEspecially not when lives are at risk.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/us/coronavirus-deaf-culture-challenges.html", "headline": "For the Deaf, Social Distancing Can Mean Social Isolation", "date": "2020-06-04T15:08:16+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Since the coronavirus pandemic began, Ashlea Hayes, who is deaf and blind and who works as the secretary of National Black Deaf Advocates, has become much more cautious.

But for the deaf, new social distancing guidelines, like staying six feet from others and wearing a mask, can present particular challenges, making everyday tasks more complicated and bringing increased stress and anxiety.Some 466 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss. In the United States, over 37 million adults, about 15 percent of the population, report some trouble hearing, according to the National Institutes of Health.Grace Cogan, who is deaf and lives in Jamesville, N.Y., experiences similar feelings of anxiety when shopping: Masks that cover the mouth prevent her from effectively communicating, she said, leaving her to rely on eyes and the slant of eyebrows to understand others. She has since assigned her boyfriend to do most of the shopping because she \u201ccannot stand the ever-widening gap that exists.\u201d\u201cThis pandemic has really further divided the inclusion of deaf and hard of hearing community from the hearing world, or in other words, isolated us even more,\u201d she said.When everyone started wearing masks, Ms. Cogan discovered that deaf people\u2019s ability to communicate \u201cwent out the window.\u201d \u201cWe now have to rely on our cellphones to communicate, or gestures,\u201d she said.When she does venture out, she experiences \u201cincreased bouts of anxiety\u201d before and while shopping, and afterward she needs time to recover.\u201cI come home and I am exhausted,\u201d Ms. Cogan said. \u201cIt is mentally challenging to navigate the crowds of obscured faces and witness hostility when people attempt to talk to me. It is concerning because it is the new normal, and my fear is that the deaf community will be marginalized even more.\u201dMany deaf people rely on visual cues like the movement of another person\u2019s lips, said Michelle Willenbrock, a vocational rehabilitation counselor in St. Louis.

According to Ms. Willenbrock, not being able to meet with a counselor in person can create anxiety and depression in people with severe expressive and receptive communication barriers.\u201cThe challenge is getting a sign language interpreter to be present on Zoom and making sure that the captions work,\u201d she said.Sign language interpreters are among a growing group of essential workers during the pandemic, often called on to stand beside officials communicating vital information on television and in internet livestreams. But they are not everywhere.Zoom meetings and FaceTime chats have largely replaced in-person gatherings and social events for the deaf and blind, who are subject to the same lockdown and shelter-in-place orders as everyone else.Ms. Hayes, who uses pro-tactile American Sign Language, a form of A.S.L. that relies on physical touch between people communicating, said she was recently on a Zoom call with black interpreters that had over 200 people.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Key Things to KnowCard 1 of 4The state of the virus in the U.S. The country continues to face higher Covid death rates than other wealthy nations, though new cases are falling.

Cordano, president of Gallaudet University, a liberal arts university for the deaf in Washington, said it was time for the United States to rethink the way it responds to crises.\u201cWe must reimagine our world to consider, to include our deaf community first, not after,\u201d she said, urging improvements in education equity, health equity, employment and retraining, and support for deaf entrepreneurs and researchers.As the number of coronavirus cases in America begins to slow and states gradually begin to reopen with restrictions, there is work to be done to protect deaf and blind people, like requiring the use of certified deaf interpreters and sign language interpreters for all public service announcements and rethinking the current one-size-fits-all definition of social distancing, Ms. Cordano said.\u201cThe \u2018two adults, six feet apart\u2019 standard carries its own inherent bias, assuming all those social distancing are the same: that they are hearing, seeing and without any need of support,\u201d Ms. Cordano said.She added that a significant portion of the American population, including young children, older adults, deaf-blind people and other people with disabilities, need people in proximity for their safety and well-being.As leaders begin to navigate a world already forcefully reshaped by the pandemic, Ms. Cordano said it was important that deaf-blind people \u201chave a seat at the table on policy and design.\u201d\u201cBecause our daily lives have always required us to adapt continuously, we have the natural skill, energy and commitment to adapt when a large-scale crisis hits,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s in our DNA to adapt and innovate.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/books/review/show-me-a-sign-ann-clare-lezotte.html", "headline": "A Deaf Girl Finds Her Voice on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in the 19th Century", "date": "2020-04-27T04:34:20+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Life on Martha\u2019s Vineyard has been mostly ideal for 11-year-old Mary Elizabeth Lambert, the protagonist of Ann Clare LeZotte\u2019s historical novel SHOW ME A SIGN (Scholastic, 288 pp., $18.99; ages 8 to 12).It\u2019s 1805 and she\u2019s lived in Chilmark her whole life, unaware of the safe harbor it has provided from the outside world.Mary and her fellow Chilmark residents are descendants of English colonists such as her great-great-grandfather Jonathan Lambert, who arrived in 1692 from the Weald, a region in Kent known for its deaf population. Over time, as the townspeople have become a mix of the hearing and the deaf, they\u2019ve replaced Lambert\u2019s English sign language with their own homegrown version.This community seems to embrace intersectional identities. Mary, who is deaf, enjoys amateur spy expeditions with her best friend, Nancy Skiffe \u2014 who was born hearing to deaf parents \u2014 and exchanges stories with the grizzled hermit Ezra Brewer. She trails after Thomas Richards, a freed former slave working as a farmhand for her father, or his daughter, Sally, who is Wampanoag Indian on her mother\u2019s side.But the islanders coexist at the edge of discord. Freedmen, like Thomas, aren\u2019t invited into Mary\u2019s home; he could be kidnapped and sold back into slavery at any time. Irish immigrants are only slightly more accepted. Colonists, like Nancy\u2019s father, angrily lay claim to lands that the Wampanoag have lived on for generations.Amid such tensions among the people she loves, Mary has one overriding concern. It has been eight months since her beloved brother, George, was killed in a carriage accident as they played on the high road. Pushed out of harm\u2019s way by George, Mary has been guiltily concealing the fact that she was the one who suggested their outing.Will her parents ever forgive her if they find out the truth?Meanwhile, news spreads of an unexpected visitor \u2014 a guest of the local reverend. He is Andrew Noble, a young scientist from Yale interested in studying the town\u2019s unusually high number of deaf people.Noble is warmly welcomed at first, but he soon reveals a troubling attitude: As a man of the Enlightenment, he says his aim is to find the source of the islanders\u2019 \u201cinfirmity,\u201d to use facts and data to unlock the \u201cdisease\u201d that has stricken one in four Chilmark residents.His views are a stark and insulting contrast to the villagers\u2019 self-concept.\u201cPapa was right,\u201d Mary tells herself. \u201cWe are fine as we were made.\u201dUsing her spying talents, Mary quickly discovers not only that Noble has come in search of \u201ca live specimen\u201d to examine, but also the chilling reality of what that entails.Yet LeZotte\u2019s novel is more than just a page-turner. Well researched and spare, it\u2019s a sensitive portrayal of a young girl\u2019s fight for respect and human dignity.LeZotte, deaf herself, has created a fully realized cast of characters, led by a protagonist whose mind and heart are in perfect sync.\u201cThe way my mind thinks is not just in signs or English words and sentences,\u201d Mary observes, \u201cbut in images and a flow of feeling that I imagine resembles the music I\u2019ve never heard.\u201dDialogue, both spoken and signed, is handled deftly, showing the rich cadences and patterns of each form of expression. LeZotte also gives readers a sense of M.V.S.L. (Martha\u2019s Vineyard Sign Language), used by the islanders through the mid-1900s but never fully documented, by combining \u201chome signs\u201d she used as a child with variations of American Sign Language.Like Laurie Halse Anderson\u2019s \u201cSeeds of America\u201d trilogy, this work of historical fiction offers a fresh perspective on the post-Revolutionary War years by exploring issues that are just as relevant today.Middle-grade readers of every age will find a girl to root for who is asking all the right questions as she grows: Who determines a person\u2019s value? By what means does a community decide what is right and fair?

It did not say whether it had received any complaints about any inappropriate activity that had occurred after the 1980s.The disclosure by the school, which serves students ages 3 to 21 who are deaf, hard of hearing or hearing nonverbal on the autism spectrum, is the latest sexual abuse scandal to ensnare a boarding-type school in Connecticut; Choate, Hotchkiss, the Gunnery and the Westover School have all grappled with sexual misconduct.\u201cAs a community, we are devastated,\u201d the American School for the Deaf\u2019s statement said. \u201cThe revelations exposed during this investigation are heartbreaking, and we are stunned by the realization that former trusted members of the A.S.D. family abused their power to take advantage of innocent, vulnerable children in their care.\u201dThe former staff members named by the school were Dr. Edmund Boatner, the school\u2019s executive director from 1935 to 1970; Albert Couthen, a former assistant dean of students and a former summer camp director; Richard Powers, Bernard Boucher, Thomas Vintinner and Mary Messener, all of whom were dormitory supervisors; and Umberto DeStefano, Patricia Potwine and Kenneth Bland, for whom positions were not listed.Dr. Boatner, Mr. Powers, Ms. Messener, Ms. Potwine and Mr. Bland have all since died.Mr. Couthen, Mr. Boucher, Mr. DeStefano and Mr. Vintinner could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.The school said that all four declined to be interviewed as part of the investigation or did not respond to the inquiry, which was conducted by Edward J.

Nicola Bruno Corradi Soliman, is an Italian priest. He served as the director of the Provolo Institute in Mendoza \u2014 which ran the school \u2014 despite having faced previous accusations of sexual abuse at the organization\u2019s facilities in Verona, Italy, and in La Plata, Argentina. Mr. Corradi, 83, was sentenced to 42 years in prison, and another priest, the Rev. Horacio Hugo Corbacho Blanck, 59, of Argentina, was sentenced to 45 years in prison. A former gardener at the school, Armando Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez Bravo, 49, of Argentina, received a sentence of 18 years. The three defendants had each faced numerous charges and had been in prison or under house arrest since the allegations came to light three years ago. Mr. Corbacho was the only one of the three to testify; he denied the charges, and the other two defendants did not testify, according to Gustavo Stroppiana, the prosecutor in the case.An attorney for the three  defendants, Alicia Arlotta, declined to comment on Monday. \u201cI have decided not to issue any opinions of any nature, which is what I\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been in charge of the defense,\u201d she said in a WhatsApp message.Nine of the 10 victims attended Monday\u2019s proceeding, said Oscar Barrera, a lawyer for some of the victims.

One trial involves the legal representative of the institute, directors of the school, a psychologist, a cook and a nun who are accused of failing to stop the abuse. Another involves a Japanese nun, Kumiko Kosaka, who is currently being held in pretrial detention and is accused of helping to cover up the crimes. (She has previously said she is innocent, according to Mr. Stroppiana.)Another case is expected to start next year involving alleged abuse that took place in the Provolo Institute in La Plata, near Buenos Aires, before Mr. Corradi was transferred to Mendoza in the late 1990s, Mr. Salinas said. Three victims have come forward in that case, but Mr. Salinas said he believes the real number of victims is much larger. Three people, including Mr. Corradi, have been charged. In a separate case, Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta was due to arrive in Argentina on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, to respond to allegations that he sexually abused two seminarians. He has denied the charges. Before he began his papacy in 2013, Pope Francis had worked with Mr. Zanchetta in Argentina, according to The Washington Post.

Gardiner, was impressed with Ms. Wailes\u2019s elegant weaving of two visual languages, dance and A.S.L. \u201cI could request something,\u201d Ms. Gardiner said, and \u201cshe would ask me questions and then take that information and put that into her body and translate that into A.S.L. in relationship to the text.\u201d Ms. Wailes worked with Onudeah Nicolarakis, who is credited as the production\u2019s director of A.S.L., to focus on making sign and spoken language work together, as well as imbuing the choreography with expressiveness and nuance. \u201cShe didn\u2019t just translate the words, she translated the experience and emotion,\u201d Ms. Gardiner said. \u201cOne of my favorite moments in the show is when Alexandria turns upstage and is talking about how her hoop skirt falls. She gestures at her bottom and pulling the skirt down, but she does it kind of looking back. It\u2019s cheeky and expressive.\u201dThe role was not originally for a deaf actress, but in casting, Ms. Gardiner \u2014 with Shange\u2019s approval \u2014 wanted to broaden the idea of what an African-American woman could be. She also had another ambition in this production: To illuminate the idea of colorism, in which skin tone \u2014 whether lighter or darker \u2014 can lead to favoritism and discrimination within an ethnic group. Ms. Wailes, who is half black, has a lighter complexion than the others onstage. \u201cWhen Alexandria came in and auditioned there was, for me, the excitement of, Wow, maybe my dream of exploring colorism can come true,\u201d Ms. Gardiner said. \u201cAnd, oh my gosh, she\u2019s also she\u2019s deaf? This is insane.\u201d \u201cFor Colored Girls\u201d had its premiere at the Public in 1976, the year after Ms. Wailes was born. And that connection is meaningful to her. \u201cAs a deaf woman of color who grew up dancing,\u201d she said she could see herself in the role. As she put it, \u201cI felt like I needed to be doing this show at this time.\u201dRecently Ms. Wailes spoke about bringing A.S.L. and movement together, listening with her body and the freedom that dancing gives her. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.ImageAlexandria Wailes (center) in a scene from \u201cFor Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf\u201d at the Public Theater in 2019.Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesHow does dance break down barriers between languages?  It is in the body when you learn to listen. And you learn to listen differently as a dancer. Being deaf, we always use our eyes; it\u2019s so critical for us to survive and to take in the world. So to bring in dancing is just an automatic extension of my way of life as a deaf person. I was very lucky because in the last two years of high school, I transferred to the Model Secondary School for the Deaf. It was during the 1990s and they had a strong performing-arts program. I started to meet other deaf dancers.What did that give you?More motivation and incentive to stay true to my path as an artist considering I never had anyone to look up to. I had no role model. A deaf woman of color? Dancing?[Laughs] I had to go, O.K., if that\u2019s not out there, I want to create it.How do you bring yourself to the character?This is me in my true element as an actor as a dancer. I have seven siblings. We\u2019re all girls. There are seven women in the show, and I\u2019m the only deaf person in the cast and in my family.Are you generally very expressive when you sign?Yes. I can turn it down and be less expressive. I\u2019ve worked with [the contemporary choreographer] Heidi Latsky for a few years. She had a piece, \u201cSomewhere,\u201d inspired by different renditions of \u201cOver the Rainbow.\u201d I told her that I wanted to challenge the notion of signing, which often tends to look so very beautiful and pastoral and emotive and expressive. I wanted to see signing used in an urban manner. I wanted it to feel gritty, edgy and just bigger \u2014 more like an attack in a positive way, like in your face.How did she work with you?She worked with me on my expression. She said: \u201cDon\u2019t put it in your face. It\u2019s not about putting on a show.\u201d I understood, but it was a challenge because face is my voice. My expressions are my voice. But over time, it was freeing, because I was focusing on bringing American Sign Language and movement together.How do you find rhythm without hearing the words?Signing naturally has a lot of musicality within it. The challenge is determining which signs best honor the length of the text, because in Ntozake\u2019s text you often see the slashes or you see space or an ampersand. How do I embody this physical language on top of a dancing language on top of trusting and working with the other actors who are speaking the lines that Ntozake wrote? Because a big difference between speaking and signing is I can keep signing, but you need to take a breath, right? There is a difference in the way that breath is used in both languages.This production explores the notion of colorism. How has skin tone affected you in your life?I didn\u2019t ask to look like this, do you know what I mean? [Laughs] So I was really grateful for Leah. She just got me. She understood the inherent challenges that I deal with in life because I\u2019m always passing. I\u2019m not going to deny that that privilege is there. But I\u2019ve had to suppress who I am \u2014 because the idea of who I am doesn\u2019t match who I am inside. It\u2019s an interesting tension, and it\u2019s a constant dynamic that I\u2019m negotiating all the time. Do you know why you took to dance as a deaf person?Because it\u2019s another language. I learned sign language and dance around the same time. Dance is a physical vocabulary and a way of communicating. Sometimes it relies on sound \u2014 but not always.

When it was discovered that I was profoundly deaf at six weeks old, my parents faced a common decision: Should they adapt themselves to their deaf child, learn sign language, and embrace deaf culture, or have their deaf child adapt to hearing culture, give her cochlear implants or hearing aids, and train her in the precarious art of lip-reading?My parents chose the former, believing that sign language would provide me with equal access to the opportunities afforded my hearing twin brother. So, when I was 6 months old, my parents welcomed educators from a local deaf school into their home to give signing lessons. Over several months, my mother learned to sign with me.I soon began to sign back, newly capable of asking for \u201cmilk\u201d (one hand in a squeezing gesture, as if milking a cow, but without the vertical motion) or \u201cjuice\u201d (brushing the pinkie finger shaped into the letter \u201cj\u201d by the corner of the mouth, with an otherwise closed fist). Using sign language, I communicated a lot \u2014 even more than my brother. But then something strange happened. I began speaking. Aloud. In English.\u201cDress pretty, you like?\u201d my mother recalls me asking her when I was around 3 years old. I did, it turned out, have residual hearing, as later tests confirmed. But I spoke using classic American Sign Language word order, which involves a grammatical structure closer to French than English \u2014 A.S.L. is derived from early-19th-century French Sign Language. And, although my mother knew that my syntax did not indicate limited cognitive ability, but rather an acute, developing awareness of the language, she began to wonder if sign language was the right choice after all. Was disregarding an aural-oral approach restricting my natural gift of gab?After more research my parents found what they thought was a middle path. Rather than have me undergo cochlear implant surgery \u2014 the underappreciated difficulties of which are outlined by Sara Novic in her essay \u201cA Clearer Message on Cochlear Implants\u201d \u2014 my parents hoped to supplement my sign language education with cued speech, a visual communication system invented in 1966 at Gallaudet University that functions as a supplement to speech-reading (only 30 percent of speech is visible on the lips).Dr. R. Orin Cornett, then the university\u2019s vice president for long-range planning, had believed that the deaf student population struggled to read English due to inadequate access to phonemes \u2014 the distinct percussive and tonal sounds that hearing people use to speak words. Dr. Cornett developed eight handshapes and four placements around the mouth that renders phonemes visible as a person speaks. Although cued speech was still in its infancy, the data at the time showed that early exposure to it helped deaf children develop the phonological and phonemic awareness of spoken English necessary for learning to read at the same rate as, or better than, hearing children. Cued speech can be learned in just 48 hours. My mother was convinced that this bicultural-bilingual approach involving a combination of cued speech and sign language lessons could give me the best of both worlds: full visual access to English and the hearing community, and concurrent access to sign language and the deaf community.But we apparently couldn\u2019t have it both ways. When the educators from the local deaf school learned that my parents were considering cued speech, they became livid. \u201cIf you choose cued speech,\u201d my mother recalls one of them saying, \u201cwe\u2019re not coming back here.\u201dIn the deaf community, some feel that cued speech, like cochlear implants, threatens deaf culture because they believe it arises from a medical model of deafness, through which deafness is perceived as an undesirable trait that needs to be treated or cured. A \u201csocial model,\u201d on the other hand, suggests that the environment must adapt to the deaf person, whose \u201cnatural language\u201d is sign language. The educators even asked my parents to consider sending me to their residential program, where, surrounded by fluent signers, I would absorb sign language at a faster pace and have full exposure to deaf culture. They believed that, as long as I had a strong command of sign language as a first language, I would have the foundation necessary to acquire English later on. My mother was stumped. On the one hand, she didn\u2019t know if cued speech would work, but desperately wanted to succeed at finding a way to communicate with me quickly and effectively. On the other hand, she didn\u2019t want me to be alienated from the deaf community. My father, however, was resolute: He would not send his child away. Together, they decided the promise of cued speech was worth the risk for at least a year at the nearby public school. If it didn\u2019t work out, they would have the deaf school\u2019s residential program as a fallback option.Today, I\u2019m a 30-year-old who wears hearing aids, never attended a residential deaf school, and who can sign proficiently, but not fluently. I attended public schools, surpassed most of my hearing peers in reading ability, graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English and a master\u2019s degree in creative writing, married a hearing man, and work as a full-time freelance writer. Yet despite my father\u2019s insistent confidence \u2014 \u201cI have zero regrets,\u201d he often tells me \u2014 I\u2019ll never know definitively whether my parents made the right decision.Throughout my life, I\u2019ve felt like the object of a constant tug of war between the deaf and hearing communities. Although I\u2019m rewardingly self-employed, married and highly literate, I still struggle in hearing-centric environments. I have to remind my husband more frequently than I would like to turn his head so that his lips aren\u2019t obscured while we\u2019re out with his family at dinner, or to cue what he\u2019s saying. Well-meaning hearing people frequently insult me with \u201ccompliments\u201d about how well I\u2019ve assimilated, like, \u201cI can barely tell you\u2019re deaf!\u201d (We call comments like these \u201caudist\u201d\u2014 akin to \u201cracist\u201d or \u201csexist\u201d \u2014 because they assume deaf people like me must speak aloud and sound like a hearing person to be deemed fortunate or successful.)On the other hand, when I spend time with deaf friends, I\u2019m often chided by them for not being more fluent in sign language, or otherwise embracing a more culturally deaf way of life. According to them, I\u2019ve succumbed to audism by using my voice to speak more often than my hands, and cued speech to absorb information. All this, despite performing in deaf theater throughout childhood, and, during my college years, taking sign language at Gallaudet; interning as a sports reporter covering United States soccer and swimming at the 2009 Deaflympics in Taipei, Taiwan; interning at the National Association of the Deaf; and, after graduate school, cofounding an online, intersectional journal of deaf and disability literature and art called The Deaf Poets Society. Right now, I can\u2019t be deaf without drawing criticism from somebody.I still hold out hope that the deaf and hearing communities will come to a compromise. One Maryland-based, deaf native cuer, Amy Crumrine, believes she has the answer: through her national nonprofit organization, CueSign, she is promoting an approach that involves both cued speech and sign language. Founded in 1998, the organization provides resources to several stakeholders \u2014 educational programs, organizations and families of deaf children \u2014 in the service of \u201cmanual bilingualism.\u201dAmy met with me recently in a coffee shop in Bethesda, Md., to discuss her project. During the interview, we transitioned seamlessly between sign language and cued speech, and, as we commiserated over the tensions between the hearing, deaf and cued speech communities, she repeatedly asserted that the one thing that matters most in raising deaf children is language access. \u201cI strongly believe in a family foundation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the child to be able to communicate with parents. Find a way. Whether it\u2019s cueing or signing.\u201dThis conclusion suddenly struck her during the early 1990s while she was a junior studying social work at the Rochester Institute of Technology, which is known for its National Technical Institute for the Deaf.\u201cFor the first three years, I didn\u2019t tell anyone I cued,\u201d she said. \u201cI was ashamed. I remember one night, my sorority floor, we\u2019re all sitting around, and we were just having a conversation and signing. And one person decided to say, \u2018Tell us something you wish we knew.\u2019 So, I said, \u2018I grew up with cued speech.\u2019 People looked at me \u2014 and then maybe two or three girls raised their hands and said, \u2018Me too.\u2019 And that night I cried. Because I had just come out. For the first time in my life, I felt safe.\u201d\u201cLooking back,\u201d she added, \u201cit helped me discover that I have so much to offer. And I was not going to let the politics of cueing and sign language stop me.\u201dSarah Katz (@sarahbea89) is a writer and editor who lives and works in Northern Virginia.

That\u2019s When the Sexual Abuse Began, She Said.", "date": "2019-10-16T16:05:41+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "During the last few years, the world has received a thorough education in the psychology of sexual abuse victims \u2014 the challenges of coming to terms with trauma, of erasing shame and doubt, of summoning the courage to come forward. But what if the act of speaking your truth seemed impossible in the most literal sense? What if your abuse amounted to a re-silencing because a twist of genetic fate left you unable to hear or speak, and your silence had confined you all along?On Wednesday morning, 12 women, all of them students at the New York School for the Deaf during the 1960s and \u201970s, filed a suit against it in New York State Supreme Court in Westchester County. Making use of the Child Victims Act passed by the state Legislature this year, one of more than 700 cases to do so, they claim that they were sexually abused by the dormitory housemaster, a man long since dead, who molested multiple girls on a daily basis, leaving them to struggle with the attendant agonies for decades. Steve Straus, a lawyer representing the school, said in response that the New York School for the Deaf \u201cexists to educate deaf and hearing-impaired children and provide the tools needed for lifelong success. As this matter is in suit, I am unable to comment other than to say that the claims allege conduct occurring about 50 years ago.\u201dAlso called Fanwood, the New York School for the Deaf is more than 200 years old. It had celebrated benefactors from the beginning. DeWitt Clinton was a trustee and served as the first board president. For decades Fanwood operated as a boarding school. Parents would send children, some of them toddlers, to live there during the week on the theory that deaf children required a lot of work to catch up to their hearing peers.One of the plaintiffs in the suit, Damita Jo Damiano, was 4 years old when she arrived at the campus in Westchester in 1964. Ms. Damiano came from a multigenerational deaf family in the Bronx; her father went to Fanwood, and her brother was a student as well. Her initial time there coincided roughly with the appointment of a man named Joseph Casucci to the school\u2019s supervisory staff. Mr. Casucci had been brought in as a housemaster, a role that left him presiding over the dormitory life of very young girls.Visiting New York from Colorado where she now lives, Ms. Damiano spoke about the abuse through a sign interpreter \u2014 how it began right away and how it continued over and over again. \u201cIt was a nightly routine, and we were just little girls,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cIt was the routine we would come to expect: We would do homework, take showers and the abuse would begin. It was normalized.\u201dWhen she was young, Ms. Damiano thought about telling her father, but he seemed to be on good terms with Casucci and, at the same time, very temperamental. Once, she recalled, Casucci gave her a haircut. Her father hated it and went ballistic. She worried that if she told him what Casucci was doing to her and other girls at night, that her father would kill him. For decades, she told no one.ImageThe New York School for the Deaf, also known as Fanwood, in White Plains, N.Y.Credit...Alan Zale for The New York TimesSeveral years ago a study out of the Rochester Institute of Technology showed that deaf and hearing-impaired children suffered from mistreatment disproportionate to children free from those challenges \u2014 rates were, in fact, 25 percent higher. Researchers looked at neglect and abuse that was both physical and sexual, and they found that having a deaf parent or a family member who signed was not a protection.The suit against Fanwood represents one of the first major legal challenges to an institution involving the abuse of the deaf. The implications are significant not only because the case is likely to compel more deaf victims to come forward but also because it has the potential to create a kind of infrastructure for reporting predation. Abuse of the deaf is vastly undercounted. A nonhearing person cannot easily call the police; few social workers are conversant in American Sign Language, and hiring an interpreter is an expensive burden for a victim.\u201cThe plight of sexually abused deaf people represents the quintessential tragedy faced by all sexually abused children,\u2019\u2019 said Paul Mones, who is representing the plaintiffs in the Fanwood case, and who has represented victims of childhood sexual abuse for 35 years. \u201cDeaf victims are not just silenced by the abuse, but even when they want to report their abuse, they can\u2019t communicate it to those in a position to help them.\u201dThe Fanwood suit could not have happened without the passage of the Child Victims Act in New York State, a law that broadly extends the statute of limitations for bringing civil or criminal action in abuse cases. Since it was enacted, similar legislation has been passed in New Jersey and California. Most states still provide only a narrow window for bringing charges.The genesis of the suit, however, was in social media. Six years ago, after watching a movie about clerical sex abuse, Marlene Hodge, another plaintiff, wrote a post on Facebook about what had happened at the school. It was something she had never really discussed with anyone beyond her circle of friends at Fanwood who were also experiencing the abuse.The dorm did not have individual rooms; the beds were laid out in a kind of bunkhouse style, and the abuse was often visible, the women said, to the other girls as they were going to sleep. Ms. Hodge\u2019s mother was president of the school\u2019s P.T.A. while she was there, she said, but she was too scared to tell her what was going on.ImageMarlene H. Hodge, a plaintiff in the suit, attended Fanwood starting in 1966. The abuse, she said, began immediately.Credit...Caitlin Ochs for The New York TimesOf the suits that have been brought since the Child Victims Act went into effect in New York, only a small number have been filed against individuals. Even when victims want to sue for the symbolic value, hoping to expose their abusers, they have trouble finding lawyers who will take cases with little promise of monetary compensation. The women suing the Fanwood school are likely to receive some financial reward, but they say they have no interest in a bankrupting a school with such a valuable mission. Graduates of Fanwood have not only gone to college but have also founded their own schools for the deaf.The deaf world is small, Ms. Damiano explained, and word of the suit will no doubt ricochet quickly. When she first moved to Colorado, she got in touch with other deaf people and built a community. She discovered that many people had stories like hers. \u201cWe are perfect victims,\u2019\u2019 she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/movies/moonlight-sonata-deafness-three-movements-review.html", "headline": "\u2018Moonlight Sonata\u2019 Review: A Deaf Family Connected by Beethoven", "date": "2019-09-12T11:00:02+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "The documentary \u201cMoonlight Sonata: Deafness in Three Movements\u201d places the work of Ludwig van Beethoven in an intimately modern context.

In this sweet, but formally unimaginative film, deafness is observed through three generations: Brodsky\u2019s child, her parents and, in brief animations, the long-gone artist.Brodsky, who narrates much of the film, introduces her son Jonas as he receives cochlear implants, allowing him to clearly hear. Jonas learns to play the piano, and the film\u2019s loose narrative follows his attempts to master Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight Sonata.\u201d Jonas\u2019s auditory fluency separates him from his deaf grandparents, Paul and Sally, who still derive meaning from sources other than sound.Though Jonas is the film\u2019s primary subject, Paul and Sally are its most striking characters.

He was 90.The actress Marlee Matlin, a longtime friend, confirmed his death.Mr. Bragg, who was born deaf to deaf parents, began carving out a performing career in the late 1950s after studying with the mime Marcel Marceau. He appeared at clubs in the San Francisco area like the hungry i, working in a style of his own invention he called sign mime, which combined elements of American Sign Language with the tools of mime.In the mid-1960s he joined up with Edna Simon Levine, a psychologist who worked with the deaf and for some time had been thinking about a professional company of deaf actors, and David Hays, a set and lighting designer. Together they formed the National Theater of the Deaf, which gave its first public performance in 1967 at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.The company won a special Tony Award in 1977.Mr. Bragg performed with it for 10 years, including in several Broadway shows, before becoming a visiting professor at his alma mater, Gallaudet University in Washington, which serves deaf and hard-of-hearing students. A 1979 article in The Washington Post called him \u201cthe man who invented theater as a professional career for the deaf.\u201dOne who followed the career path that Mr. Bragg opened up was Ms. Matlin, an Oscar winner for the 1986 film \u201cChildren of a Lesser God.\u201d\u201cI have known Mr. Bragg since I was 8 years old, when I took a class which he was teaching at Chicago\u2019s Center for Deafness,\u201d she said by email. \u201cAlways curious and always with questions, particularly because he was the first Deaf person I had met who was an actor, I remember asking him, \u2018Can I be an actor like you?\u2019 To which he responded with a warm smile, \u2018Yes, you can!\u2019 That stuck with me.\u201dImageIn his memoir, published in 1989, Mr. Bragg recalled accidentally discovering he was deaf when he was a boy.Bernard Nathan Bragg was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 27, 1928, to Wolf and Jennie (Stoloff) Bragg. His father had created an amateur acting group for deaf performers.With deaf parents and a deaf aunt and uncle living in the same building, Mr. Bragg was surrounded by sign language. In \u201cLessons in Laughter: An Autobiography of a Deaf Actor\u201d (1989), he recalled the revelatory moment when, as a little boy, he was sent to the store with a note and money to buy his mother cigarettes.\u201cI gave the coin and the note to the proprietor and he looked at me and started to move his mouth,\u201d Mr. Bragg wrote. \u201cHe did not sign at all, and I became visibly disconcerted by the strange movements of his mouth under his heavy mustache.\u201dThe man read the note and gave him the cigarettes, and he went back to his fifth-floor apartment.\u201cIt was thus that I made the discovery of my deafness, all by myself,\u201d Mr. Bragg wrote.He graduated from the New York School for the Deaf in 1947 and enrolled at what was then Gallaudet College, studying theater there and acting in school plays. Though he enjoyed performing, there was no obvious career path in show business for a deaf person; instead he took a teaching job at the California School for the Deaf in Berkeley, occasionally performing skits and directing small shows at conventions and clubs for the deaf. Then, in 1956, he made a life-changing trip to see Marceau perform in San Francisco.ImageBernard Bragg in 1969 at seminar at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, a part of the Rochester Institute of Technology.Credit...RIT/NTID Deaf Studies ArchiveMarceau\u2019s ability to hold the crowd\u2019s attention without words so struck Mr. Bragg that he sought Marceau out after the show and, with a note, introduced himself and asked where he could study mime. Marceau asked him to return the next day with a sample of his work, which he did: He performed two original sketches, one in which he played Noah and all the animals on the ark, the other in which he depicted all the instruments of an orchestra. Marceau invited him to study with him in France.He spent the summer of 1956 doing just that, and when he returned to the United States he began performing in nightclubs, schools and universities in the San Francisco area. His routines were generally a mix of set pieces and improvisation.\u201cHe told me a funny story about one night in the hungry i,\u201d Michael A. Schwartz, a longtime friend who met Mr. Bragg when he participated in the National Theater of the Deaf\u2019s summer school in 1976, said by email. \u201cWhen Bernard finished his act and exited the stage, the audience applauded, but the manager ran out on the stage and said, \u2018Stop, stop applauding, it doesn\u2019t matter, Bernard is deaf, he can\u2019t hear your applause.\u2019 When someone told Bernard, he ran back to the stage and mimed, \u2018I am deaf, but with my eyes, I see your applause. Keep applauding.\u2019 \u201dFrom 1958 to 1961 Mr. Bragg had his own television show on KQED in San Francisco, \u201cThe Quiet Man,\u201d on which he would perform mimed stories, among other things. He also continued to teach and in 1959 earned a master\u2019s degree in special education at San Francisco State University.Mr. Bragg moved back east in 1967 to help start the National Theater of the Deaf. Its fund-raising efforts were given a boost that year when NBC broadcast an episode of the series \u201cExperiment in Television\u201d called \u201cTheater of the Deaf,\u201d featuring Mr. Bragg and others who would become core members of the National Theater. The group mounted national tours and appeared several times on Broadway in the late 1960s.In 1973 Mr. Bragg was an artist in residence with the Moscow Theater of Mimicry and Gesture, and in 1977 he went on an international tour sponsored by the State Department and other groups, appearing in 25 countries.Notable Deaths 2018: Stage and ScreenA memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018His projects after leaving the National Theater included serving as a technical adviser for the 1979 television movie \u201c \u2026 And Your Name Is Jonah,\u201d about a deaf boy who is wrongly labeled intellectually disabled. He also appeared in the film.He leaves no immediate survivors.In 2014 two students at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Jean Pietrowski and Allison Thompson, curated an exhibition there that focused on Mr. Bragg\u2019s career.\u201cWatching him sign,\u201d Ms. Pietrowski said at the time, \u201cis like a small religious experience. The way he moves is so expressive, you can\u2019t help but be entranced.\u201dThat expressiveness remained with him even in his final months. Mr. Bragg made a cameo appearance in March in an article in The New York Times about immigrant workers in the United States who fill low-wage, low-skill jobs. The article focused on one such worker, Irma Mangayan, from the Philippines, a personal care aide in the assisted living center where Mr. Bragg occupied a room.\u201cIn Room 411,\u201d the article said, \u201cshe improvised sign language to communicate with Bernard Bragg, an 89-year-old who achieved fame decades ago as a deaf actor.\u201cMr. Bragg, asked what he thought of Ms. Mangayan, pointed to her, placed his hands over his heart and smiled lovingly. He then flapped his arms to suggest she was an angel.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/well/live/unlocking-the-world-of-sound-for-deaf-children.html", "headline": "Unlocking the World of Sound for Deaf Children", "date": "2018-10-08T09:00:01+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Jane R. Madell, a pediatric audiology consultant and speech-language pathologist in Brooklyn, N.Y., wants every parent with a child who is born hearing-impaired to know that it is now possible for nearly all children with severe hearing loss to learn to listen and speak as if their hearing were completely normal.\u201cChildren identified with hearing loss at birth and fitted with technology in the first weeks of life blend in so well with everyone else that people don\u2019t realize there are so many deaf children,\u201d she told me.With the appropriate hearing device and auditory training for children and their caregivers during the preschool years, even those born deaf \u201cwill have the ability to learn with their peers when they start school,\u201d Dr. Madell said. \u201cEighty-five percent of such children are successfully mainstreamed. Parents need to know that listening and spoken language is a possibility for their children.\u201dDetermined to get this message out to all who learn their children lack normal hearing, Dr. Madell and Irene Taylor Brodsky produced a documentary, \u201cThe Listening Project,\u201d to demonstrate the enormous help available through modern hearing assists and auditory training.Among the \u201cstars\u201d in the film, all of whom grew up deaf or severely hearing-impaired, are Dr. Elizabeth Bonagura, an obstetrician-gynecologist and surgeon; Jake Spinowitz, a musician; Joanna Lippert, a medical social worker, and Amy Pollick, a psychologist. All started out with hearing aids that helped them learn to speak and understand spoken language.But now all have cochlear implants that, as Ms. Lippert put it, \u201creally revolutionized my world\u201d when, at age 11, she became the first preteen to get a cochlear implant at New York University Medical Center.\u201cSuddenly when I was playing soccer, I could hear what my teammates were saying,\u201d Ms. Lippert, now 33, recalled. \u201cMy mother practically cried when I heard a cricket chirping in the house. I couldn\u2019t talk on the phone before. Now in my job at the Veteran\u2019s Affairs Hospital in Manhattan, I\u2019m on the phone all day long. The implant has been a wonderful gift.\u201dMs. Pollick, 43 and deaf since birth, lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband and two young children, all with normal hearing. Her deaf parents, determined that she learn to speak, got her a hearing aid at 6 months along with years of auditory therapy. A graduate of New York\u2019s prestigious Stuyvesant High School and Wesleyan University, Ms. Pollick was in graduate school researching primate vocalizations when she got a cochlear implant.She told me, \u201cThe earlier you get the implant, the more successful it is because the more auditory input the brain gets at an early age, the better the auditory skills you will develop.\u201dDr. Bonagura, 34, who lives in Alameda, Calif., didn\u2019t get a cochlear implant until she was 22. She said it made medical school a lot easier and enabled her to work in obstetrics, a field that involves emergencies, loud operating rooms and the use of face masks that make lip reading impossible.\u201cNo other field of medicine compares to the joy of delivering babies,\u201d she said.Mr. Spinowitz, a 27-year-old guitarist living in San Francisco, was born with profound hearing loss and used hearing aids until age 15 when suddenly they no longer worked because there was nothing to amplify \u2014 he had lost all residual hearing.Once he got his implant, he said, \u201cI began listening to music \u2014 all kinds of music \u2014 trying to make up for lost time.\u201d He played in bands throughout high school and college and now works at YouTube helping music labels get their work represented.\u201cThe implant made it easier to communicate in all kinds of situations. It made college and my job possible,\u201d Mr. Spinowitz said. His message to the parents of children with profound hearing loss: \u201cSound makes the world a better place, so if you can have it, go for it.\u201dA cochlear implant bypasses the nonfunctioning hair cells of the auditory system and transmits sound directly to the auditory nerve so that the brain can process it. Implants can be inserted in babies before they can walk. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, children with profound hearing loss who receive implants before 18 months of age \u201cdevelop language skills at a rate comparable to children with normal hearing.\u201d As Dr. Bonagura says in the documentary, \u201cThe ability now to put implants in babies is incredible. They grow up with sound; they grow up hearing everything. Sound is a gift \u2014 laughter, voices, nature. How can you take that away from anyone?\u201dStill, many deaf people resist the current technology and insist that children with profound hearing loss should learn only sign language. They reject the idea that deafness needs to be corrected. But, as Dr. Madell points out, only 0.1 percent of the population knows sign language, and 95 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents, who then have to spend a long time learning to sign, during a period when children are normally learning to speak.\u201cDeafness today is not what it was 20 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cTechnology is so much better that virtually every child with hearing loss will be able to hear with the right devices \u2014 hearing aids and cochlear implants.\u201dEvery baby born in the United States is supposed to be screened at birth for hearing loss. One baby in 1,000 of those screened will turn out to have moderate, severe or profound hearing loss that, if not promptly and properly treated, can delay their ability to learn to speak and understand speech.Today\u2019s auditory technology makes it possible for these babies to be fitted with a device that enables them to hear and, with auditory training, develop language skills as good as those of their normal-hearing peers.Without newborn screening, critical months for learning spoken language can be lost. Children with serious hearing loss who are not screened at birth or soon thereafter often do not get their hearing checked until many months later when parents realize that they don\u2019t respond appropriately to sounds and speech, or even later when they don\u2019t start to speak at the usual milestones.The American Academy of Pediatrics has established what are known as 1-3-6 guidelines that state that every baby should be screened for hearing by 1 month of age, a diagnosis of hearing loss made by 3 months and entry into early intervention services by 6 months. Yet currently only 67 percent of babies with profound hearing loss receive appropriate intervention by 6 months of age."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/magazine/searching-for-a-lost-odessa-and-a-deaf-childhood.html", "headline": "Searching for a Lost Odessa \u2014 and a Deaf Childhood", "date": "2018-08-09T09:00:01+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "What I remember most of all is washing Leo Tolstoy\u2019s ears. The year is 1989, the mornings of revolution, the year when my birth country begins to fall apart. His ears are larger than my head; I am standing on the shoulders of a boy who is standing on the shoulders of another boy. I am scrubbing the enormous bearded head on a pedestal \u2014 in the center of Leo Tolstoy Square, one block from our first apartment. This is childhood: Once a year, my classmates and I are sent to the center of the square. Our assignment is to wash the head of a dead writer. We climb on top of one another\u2019s bodies and scrub Tolstoy\u2019s nostrils, ears.In the distance, my parents laugh, watching. Their deaf boy climbs and scrubs the enormous ears. Behind them, a band of sailors marches along \u2014 Odessa is a seaport, with a large navy school. The young captain shouts, though I can\u2019t hear him: left, right, left, right. The sailors\u2019 legs go up and down, up and down. Aware I see her from my Tolstoy post, my middle-aged, slightly heavy mother begins to march at the end of their column, her legs high, mimicking their legs, her skirt flying up, as my father salutes.\u2b24I had no hearing aids until I came to America. The Odessa I know is a silent city, where the language is invisibly linked to my father\u2019s lips moving as I watch his mouth repeat stories again and again. He turns away. The story stops. He looks at me again, but the story has already moved on.Decades later, when I come back to this city, I don\u2019t feel I have quite returned until I turn my hearing aids off.Click \u2014 and people\u2019s lips move again, but no sound.No footsteps of grandmothers running after their grandchildren. No announcements by tram-conductors as the tram stops at a station and, finally, I jump off.A cab whooshes by me and abruptly parks at the curb. I do not hear the screech of its brakes.This is the Odessa of my childhood: my father\u2019s lips open, in Proviantskaya Street. I see a story. He bends to pick up a coin. The story stops. Then, as he straightens up and smiles at me, it is a story again.\u2b24A soldier drags a Jewish child out of the house. His adopted mother, a Russian woman, is running behind the soldiers, half naked, wailing. Another soldier blocks her. Another soldier slaps her and laughs. The street empties, child\u2019s toys lying in the snow. The neighbors shut windows. Doors slam. A woman kneels on an empty sidewalk as two soldiers shove her child into the van.That\u2019s when it happened, my father\u2019s lips pause \u2014Out of the snow of Odessa, a fat Ukrainian man appears. What are you doing? You bastards! Why are you taking away my child? Give me your names! You bastards. I will go to the authorities. Your names! His spit flies in the angry air. I want to see your documents! He can\u2019t stop spitting.Soldiers pause, bewildered. This is a child of a Jew \u2014 can\u2019t you see?You morons! Do I look like a Jew? The fat Ukrainian stomps his foot, he shakes his large body around the young woman on the pavement.The windows begin to open. Who speaks to German soldiers like this in the occupied city? People stare. The soldiers steal a look at the windows. Now they walk quickly to the van. The child is left in the snow.The fat man gathers the boy in his hands, wraps him in an overcoat. I will complain to the authorities! To the woman: a lingering, frenzied kiss. The van with soldiers disappears into the streets.Without adding a single word, the fat man walks away, with the child and the woman. He makes sure they step in front of him. The neighbors never see him again. But this story lives on, and my father, the child he saved, the child who never again sees this fat man, keeps repeating this story to his own deaf son.\u2b24If my cousins and uncles met me in the street, it would be scandalous. I send holiday emails and occasional gifts. The man in his 40s who comes back to this city is not me, not the American relative they know of. Why am I back here in this country that betrayed my family? For years, everyone I know will ask me why I came back here to these streets. What is it I am trying to recall?I turn off my hearing aids and walk up to walls, touch them with my fingers. This is the act of a fool who touches the skin of time and walks through it, toward childhood \u2014 touches the sidewalks of the streets he once touched as a 15-year-old deaf boy. How much the present moment means to those who have nothing more.When trams pass, the walls vibrate, as do remembered scraps of stories. Na\u00efve to think this. Na\u00efve to think that Odessa, which is a part of my father\u2019s consciousness, is mine again. I turn off my hearing aids and am again in the silence around which people\u2019s lips move.\u2b24My father is a foundling. The year he is born his own father, Ilya, is arrested and shot as \u201can enemy of the people.\u201d The year he is born his mother, Julianna, is \u201csent away\u201d to Siberia. He remembers none of this. His memory starts four years later.It is 1941, the war begins and Shura, the man who adopted my father, volunteers to go to the front. It is 1941, and his adopted mother, Natalia, takes a tram to the outskirts to dig trenches around the city. It is 1941 when a 4-year-old boy has his first memory: a fat Ukrainian man saving him from foreign soldiers. Neighbors open the windows and watch Natalia weep in the snow.1941 is the first year my father remembers. Axis planes are bombing the vodka factory. The neighbors are running out with teakettles, pans. They drink vodka from cobblestones. I am the deaf boy watching my father\u2019s lips.He bends to tie his shoes and the story stops.He straightens up and the people are running with teakettles dripping with vodka \u2014 everyone is happy, if only for a moment.In my father\u2019s story, it is always 1941. Old women drink shots of vodka from their little pill bottles. They turn away, as if trying to hide something. What do they hide in 1941? The silence of their men who do not write from war-torn territories? It is 1941, father\u2019s lips say. The vodka factory is bombed. The women clink glasses. The spit flies like a tiny bird.\u2b24My father is long dead. In the Odessa streets, there are new cars, new noises. People shout in a different language now, new buildings are erected and quickly slip into ruin.I take off my American-made hearing aids. Now I am the deaf boy who tries to walk faster in the snow of the Odessa streets. Lips open but no sound comes out. No footsteps of my father as he drags our grocery bags. No pigeons clacking on the sill. No screams of passing sirens.ImageCredit...Illustration by Katrien De BlauwerI am a man who comes back after 20 years and finds everyone dead. I am an aging man who takes off his jacket on a bench, sees dogs\u2019 teeth bared, a click of tongue, a hiss. He does not know why he is here \u2014 why he is happy, free. He doesn\u2019t know why he bought his ticket to Odessa. If his parents are dead, what is here for him, in this empty city?\u2b24Father has no stories. Over and over, the same memory of the occupied city is repeated. German and Romanian soldiers march in 1941. There are no letters from Shura in 1941 because no one writes letters from the bombed-out regiments in 1941. Natalia sews dresses because even in the occupied city people buy dresses. She buys apples because boys in 1941 eat apples. And there are still no letters from Shura. No one knows he was sent on a horse, to attack German tanks.It is 1941 and Odessa is a city emptied of its Jews. Germans march in the streets of the city where life goes on, people buy dresses. My father has no stories. He is a young boy shaved bald so his dark hair doesn\u2019t call attention to him. There are no stories from 1941.Each morning is the smell of fresh bread. It isn\u2019t for the boy. Natalia is baking bread for the neighbors each week so they won\u2019t report the family. Slap. Don\u2019t eat the bread, boy. Slap.That year, 1941, in the occupied city, Shura appears on their apartment steps. There are no stories, only this image. A runaway soldier always knocks on the door. It is always 1941 in the occupied city, and Shura always appears on the apartment steps. That, and the smell of bread the boy isn\u2019t allowed to put in his mouth.\u2b24There are no stories. The man they thought dead stands in front of them in the living room. There was bombardment? There were horses? Tanks? He gives no details. He was captured by German soldiers. Loaded into a train. He jumped in the middle of the night.I am a deaf boy who asks his father for a story. Only about half of spoken Russian is visible on the lips.Two dozen years later, I am back in this city. I have walked up and down boulevards, trying to remember my father\u2019s stories. I open windows, see dogs pee under the monument to a politician, his arrogant chest leaning into history.There are no stories, just every second word on my father\u2019s lips, just us. A runaway Russian soldier sneaks back into the occupied city to see his son. All I have is this image of him opening the door.\u2b24My father has no stories. Only lips that keep moving in front of his deaf boy who has no hearing aids. Sound heading up the winding caverns of my ears, then conducted through slender bones, making the membranes vibrate and these tiny hairs dance. My father dies right after we come to the United States of America.There are no stories. Back now in the Odessa streets, I take the aids out again. Then, put them in. What is it that I keep trying to recall? Hearing is not a reflex. A deaf man when given hearing aids must be taught to hear:This is a truck rumbling.This is a phone ringing.This is a drunk on the second floor coughing like a chicken being skinned alive.Shura walks to Odessa in snow for a month. I see it all in fragments. Fragments are my wholes.It is 1941. He doesn\u2019t have food. Having jumped the German train while the convoy slept, he limps. He avoids main roads. He eats the snow. He is walking to Odessa through 30 days of snow. He steals food from neighboring villages. Otherwise, he eats snow.How many of the villagers choose not to report this man, running away from the backyard with a headless chicken? Otherwise, he eats snow.Having escaped Germans, Shura stops in villages at night. He avoids main roads. He is a handsome man. Women give him food. There aren\u2019t any husbands left in the villages. In the middle of the night, he steals clothes from the laundry line, runs. For days, snow.He avoids main roads. But nearing the city, the checkpoints pop up at every entrance. Guards. Dogs.Here, my father\u2019s lips stop.\u2b24Shura, his belly full of snow, meets two women on the road. He is a fugitive. They are locals in the occupied territory. He is seen. They can report the runaway man \u2014 and why not? Soldiers know of food stolen from farmers along the road.He kneels. In front of them, in snow, he kneels. Why is he here? He says he wants to see his 4-year-old boy in Odessa. Please.I heard only fragments of this story. A man kneels in the snow. One of the women kneels next to him. A fragment, nothing else. I type it on the empty page. I stop and walk around. Erase it. Type it again. Why is she kneeling next to a man she doesn\u2019t know? This man perhaps reminds her of her own man shot in the war? Belly full of snow.Shura and the woman pass through checkpoint after checkpoint. He smiles at the soldiers, the woman leans against him. A long kiss. He coos to the child in her arms.Father\u2019s lips stop moving. Too much snow.After they pass the gates the woman says goodbye. Shura never sees her again.\u2b24There are many versions of the story of the runaway soldier. In one, the boy kisses his father and behind him sees the Romanian police enter the building. Quickly, the boy\u2019s mother takes out her largest dress and her big white hat. Quickly, the boy\u2019s father fills a bra with newspapers. The boy watches Shura and Natalia, all dressed up like two girls, waltz into the courtyard, past this soldier, past other soldiers, into the street.There is no story to remember. Just a fragment in which Shura and Natalia, dressed like two girls, are escaping into the street. A drunken Romanian policeman wants to stop them. He is propositioning Shura. He is complimenting Shura\u2019s curves in a summer dress. The drunken Romanian is trying to grab Shura by the hem of the dress, shoving money into the dress pockets. Come with me, Beautiful!What a sight it must have been. Kissing in snow, they were, Natalia and her husband. The snow falls into their hair, into their taffeta blouses.\u2b24Or perhaps there is no man in a dress. No vodka drops falling from the sky. Just a son who is afraid to admit to himself what really happened. So he makes up many stories. I am a deaf boy who watches the silence inside his father, as the father tries to fill it up with stories. The boy sees it but doesn\u2019t understand.From all these stories, one thing stayed with me. In every version, my father is always the child who kisses Shura and behind him sees the Romanian police enter the building.\u2b24Here is something my father never speaks about: The war ends in 1945 and Shura comes back. Natalia gives a party that is interrupted by Soviet military police, who come in without knocking and take her husband away. The Soviets suspect him of treason. Hundreds of veterans are being sent to Siberia. Not killing yourself when taken captive is a crime punished by the State.Here is something my father never speaks about: What saves Shura from prison is the fact that when he returns from the war, he is nearly deaf. Once, under bombardment, he dragged his wounded army sergeant to cover. The bombardment continued. The sergeant survived. Shura became deaf.The Soviet military policemen ask questions: He doesn\u2019t hear. They are shouting. He doesn\u2019t hear. They slap him. He doesn\u2019t hear. Slap. He doesn\u2019t hear. Slap. Deaf and dumb, the officers say. They let him go.Why did I buy my ticket to Odessa?I found this scribble in my father\u2019s handwriting, on the back of Shura\u2019s photograph: A deaf man\u2019s scream, unheard by himself. I cannot forget it. That scream. Uncensored by even his own ears. A human voice as it actually is.\u2b24I can\u2019t hear through the walls. If you shout at me across the street, I won\u2019t turn my head. There is a kind of openness in deafness. My hearing aids whistle, my accent gives itself away, eagerly, too eagerly. I stare at people\u2019s lips. A deaf person, I find most people become intimate with me almost instantly. They see a large, awkward man in front of them. They might feel slightly superior or slightly frustrated with my accent. They are bewildered by having to repeat themselves twice, three or four times. The theater is in how they say, I understand your accent, how they nod.Decades later, I come back to Odessa and turn off my hearing aids. This, I know, is the silence Shura found himself in when he came back here in 1945. His deafness is something Father never shared with me.\u2b24We are at the beach. Father is telling Shura stories as my mother suddenly laughs seeing my friend and me run into water, swimming half a mile to the jetty, climbing on it and then walking on it, as if walking on water, waving back to my parents. They are so small, left there on the sand. We are blowing kisses to pretty girls sunbathing on the hotel\u2019s rooftop terrace.There are no whole stories for a child who lip-reads. But there are fragments. Some are found at the tram station. Some are smelled at the street corner that allows itself to become a recollection. Some are bits of sand.Sitting on the sand, my father is in the middle of his retelling, when my mother interrupts him, points at two boys walking on water.If my parents are dead, what is here for me in this now empty city? When I say the word nothing, I name something that is there.\u2b24I am 8 years old in the snow watching my father step into an expensive restaurant. Inside is someone\u2019s wedding party.Watch me, Father\u2019s lips say.Through the large glass windows of a restaurant, his boy watches him from the snowed-in street.Father enters the room, already dancing. He enters the room, elbowing his way straight to the bride. He is kissing the bride on both cheeks, then laughing, he lifts her up, puts her on his shoulders, and he swings into the middle of the room.I am standing in snow, clinging to my mother\u2019s hand. Across the street, my father, with that large white cloud of a bride above his head. He is circling with the bride on his shoulders as the room gathers around him to applaud. Then he places the bride down right before the groom and kisses her hand.I am not sure what is happening. Now he waltzes elbowing his way to the fattest grandmother in the room, picking up a bottle of champagne and pouring into her glass. He kneels before that fat woman, kissing her hand. Everyone is circling them, and clapping.Outside, in snow, I am a bewildered boy watching his father circle the room at a stranger\u2019s wedding. My father who spends so many years repeating the same story is laughing and the room around him laughs. He comes back outside, smiling, bringing a large bottle of champagne and seven pieces of wedding cake.At a large wedding no one knows one another, father whispers. The bride thinks the visitor is a relative of the groom. The groom tries to impress the bride\u2019s important guest.Here is something my father never speaks about, something I will find out only many years later: This is a trick learned from Shura. A deaf man back from the war, unable to find a job to bring home food, Shura danced at strangers\u2019 weddings, surprising his child and wife at night with plates of wedding cake.\u2b24I wonder: In these streets I can still share with you, Father, streets where you watched your own deaf father in 1945, were you bewildered by his deafness? I come back so that I can see for you the Odessa streets your deaf father saw. Sounds are contagious even if no one notices. The sound of someone breathing heavily in line for groceries affects the breathing rate of others in the line. I am walking to the Hotel Krasnaya, to see a stranger\u2019s wedding.You once stole for me seven pieces of wedding cake. Look, now I tell you seven things a deaf man sees at weddings:One. When husbands smile at their wives, the corners of their mouths move toward their eyes. But when they smile at the notary signing the wedding certificate, I see the corners of their mouths move toward their ears.Two. When businesspeople speak, they stand toe to toe. But if one person\u2019s foot begins to move away, this person wants to be someplace else.Three. When couples eat cake and they are happy, their legs wiggle or bounce. But we don\u2019t need to look under the tables to see happy feet. See their shirts or shoulders. See how the wiggling feet make shoulders, too, vibrate.Four. A crowd waiting at the wedding buffet. Notice how people whistle to calm themselves.Five. A woman talks to the relative who makes her slightly uncomfortable. She touches her face, licks lips.Six. Sometimes it is a man who is uncomfortable. See his unease by how he\u2019s stroking his beard.Seven. If there is an orchestra at the wedding, there is silence in the conductor\u2019s fingers before the baton lifts, making music visible inside the bodies of others.Deafness is a theater. Here the deaf person is the audience. Everyone else is an actor. No need to worry about the silent world to which the hearing people think we are exiled. The deaf do not believe in silence. Silence is the invention of the hearing.\u2b24Shura, goodbye, I am leaving. We were standing at the cemetery. I watch my father\u2019s lips circle the silence of his goodbye as he kneels before Shura\u2019s grave. Goodbye, my dear. I am leaving. I am going away to give my boy a future.It is snowing. It is 1993. I watch my father\u2019s lips whisper to the gravestone: Our postman, Sasha, agreed to come look after your grave. Do you hear me?I am in Odessa, Father. It is 2018, 25 years after we left this city. I come back here so that I can turn off my hearing aids and stop time. I put my hands to the wall \u2014 and hear the sound of taxis stopping at the lights, the whooshing of trolleys, the women arguing on the street corner. I take my hands off the wall \u2014 nothing. Hands to the wall \u2014 a dog barks, a siren rises in the avenue. Hands off the wall \u2014 nothing.It is 1993 again. Silence doesn\u2019t subscribe to the concept of time.\u2b24Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet dictator, is giving a speech. His mouth moves, the crowd claps, I hear nothing. I am raising the TV volume, Brezhnev makes another pronouncement, I do not hear it, I raise the volume, the crowd is giving a standing ovation, I do not hear it.I am 5 years old. The teacher comes to our class. Her voice trembling. I do not hear it. Children, Brezhnev died, her lips say. I am afraid the war will begin tomorrow at midday, her lips say.My parents do not yet know I have lost my hearing, the aftermath of a case of mumps that a Soviet doctor mistook for a cold. At midday, the factory whistles continue for an hour. I do not hear them.It is on the day Brezhnev dies that my mother learns of my deafness, and the odyssey of doctors and hospitals begins. My mother shouts at senior citizens in public transport to promptly get up please and give her sick child a seat; my father, embarrassed, hides on the other side of the trolley. I cannot hear a word. Mother is towering over me, guarding me with her body from the eyes of the trolley.Brezhnev is dead. Strangers wear black clothes in public. Thus begins the history of my deafness.\u2b24My father dies of a heart attack barely a year after we arrive in Rochester, a few weeks before I begin to wear hearing aids. I will never hear his voice.We came to America for the happiness of our children, Mother says at the funeral. She will survive my father by 24 years; each year she will remind me that I look more and more like him.She will have a stroke, live paralyzed for over a decade; by the end she won\u2019t be able to walk and will only retain the use of one arm. She will be the most beautiful woman I know, she will be shouting at strangers, confusing her American neighbors and nurses for the Russians she knew decades ago, she will curse and laugh at them in a language they do not understand, as they smile polite frightened greetings at the strange woman in a wheelchair who shouts at them like a paralyzed Old Testament prophet with disheveled white hair. For a decade, I will be taking her for walks in a wheelchair and whisper to myself, This is the most beautiful woman I know.Your father, he liked to travel, she says, to go away, because he wanted the happiness of coming home. That was the ultimate happiness, your father told me. Always remember, the ultimate happiness is coming home.She tells me not to call her after 6 p.m. She calls me at 1 a.m. because she is lonely for a chat. She calls my cousin at 5 a.m. to invite her to a party that doesn\u2019t exist, wakes up the household of five. She loves long conversation, often punctuated by exclamations of how my father loved her. She calls at 9 a.m. to ask why I am not calling her all day long. She leaves 20 messages within an hour. Now, after she has died, these are the most prized of my possessions, her phone messages.How much a person changes after she dies. This essay should be about my mother. But I cannot yet place her voice into mere prose. And, why should I? Whenever I want to hear her I can check my messages. I love you, son. Why aren\u2019t you calling me?Each morning, for decades, she calls and demands to know what I ate for breakfast. She calls and reports what she ate for dinner. This is our decade after the stroke. She is reading a book. For many months on end, she is reading the same book.Don\u2019t ask me why I came to America. I came to America for the happiness of my children. She will repeat the same things over and over, each story punctuated by, Water, give me water, and Cover me, cover me, and ending the same story, always ending with, I love you so much, my boy.No, she says: I don\u2019t want anything, I don\u2019t want anything, but give me a raspberry. Son, why are you asking me what I remember? Stop asking me. I am too old to have memories.\u2b24I refuse to explain this silence of an Odessa street to anyone \u2014 it is too intimate. I come here because my parents can never come back. I make it to this city so Mother can again march at the end of the column of sailors, as my father salutes.Your ears aren\u2019t empty, Mother used to say, they are open.I have no one to whom I can explain what happens when I finally turn my hearing aids on \u2014 now the tremble of the inner ear is relentless. The brain is taught: This is the shuffle of your own feet. This is the voice of your hotel neighbor speaking in the other room as it vibrates through the walls. When I turn the hearing aids on in these streets, my parents are dead again. So, I turn them off.Here I see us: In the afternoon, we are walking down Pushkinskaya Street with our heavy suitcases, we are headed toward the train station. It is the 14th of January, 1993. It\u2019s snowing. The trolleys and cabs aren\u2019t functioning. We are dragging our suitcases across the city to the train, saying good morning to this city for one last time, Victor and Ella Kaminsky and their son."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/koko-gorilla-death-sign-language.html", "headline": "Koko the Gorilla, Who Used Sign Language and Befriended Mr. Rogers, Dies at 46", "date": "2018-06-21T17:05:59+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Koko, the gorilla whose apparent aptitude for sign language endeared her to fans around the world, died in her sleep on Tuesday morning in California, according to the Gorilla Foundation, which oversaw her care.

That fame was bolstered over the years as Koko, a western lowland gorilla, charmed entertainers like Fred Rogers and Robin Williams as well as their audiences.\u201cKoko touched the lives of millions as an ambassador for all gorillas and an icon for interspecies communication and empathy,\u201d the Gorilla Foundation said in a statement. \u201cShe was beloved and will be deeply missed.\u201dBy the age of 4, Koko had developed a vocabulary of more than 170 words and showed an ability to use language creatively, Penny Patterson, her longtime caretaker and trainer, told The New York Times in 1975.\u201cShe occasionally makes up new words [signs] which are amazingly appropriate and she is able to string known words together in novel and meaningful constructions,\u201d Dr. Patterson said at the time. \u201cKoko also has a sense of humor and plays word games.\u201dKoko\u2019s language skills earned her a spot on the cover of National Geographic in 1978 and 1985, and she was the subject of many documentaries. By the time of her death, Koko\u2019s vocabulary had ballooned to more than 2,000 words, according to the foundation.ImageKoko with her trainer Penny Patterson. Koko was born on July 4, 1971, at the San Francisco Zoo.Credit...Gorilla FoundationBut soon after Koko gained fame, some in the scientific community began to question the extent of her abilities, suggesting that she was responding to cues or that Dr. Patterson and others had overstated her skill, projecting what they wanted to see onto her actions. The debate  has continued through the decades, but it did little to diminish interest in Koko.In public appearances, she seemed to experience emotions like happiness, frustration and heartbreak. A lifelong friend to other animals, she displayed an endearing gentleness toward cats. Her relationship with a kitten named All Ball inspired the popular children\u2019s book \u201cKoko\u2019s Kitten.\u201dHer celebrity was also fueled in part by interactions with famous humans, like Mr. Rogers, whose show, \u201cMister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood,\u201d featured Koko in a 1998 episode. That appearance was among the most memorable moments on the show, according to Margy Whitmer, one of its longtime producers.Koko was quickly at ease with Mr. Rogers, playing with his sweater and telling him that she loved him.\u201cHe just accepted Koko and was very relaxed with her and really showed no fear,\u201d Ms. Whitmer told The Times this year.Three years later, Koko met Robin Williams, building an instant rapport with the actor and comedian. Mr. Williams spoke fondly of the experience in interviews and even joked about their encounter in a standup routine. After he died in 2014, Koko was reportedly crestfallen.Koko was born Hanabi-ko, Japanese for \u201cFireworks Child,\u201d on July 4, 1971, at the San Francisco Zoo, according to the Gorilla Foundation. Dr. Patterson, then a doctoral student in psychology at Stanford University, began working with her the next year.By 1979, Dr. Patterson had founded the Gorilla Foundation and moved it to the Santa Cruz Mountains.Wild gorillas typically live for 30 or 40 years, while those cared for by humans can live into their 50s, according to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.

(I\u2019m deaf, so I inevitably become a magnet for these conversations.) These parents rave: \u201cIt\u2019s so fun and so visual! I can see what my baby is trying to say to me!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d I say, and tell them to keep it up.Baby sign language borrows some signs \u2014 like \u201cmilk,\u201d \u201cmore,\u201d \u201call done,\u201d \u201cmommy\u201d and \u201cdaddy\u201d \u2014 from American Sign Language in order to enable hearing parents to achieve some basic sign- and gesture-based communication with their infants before they are capable of speech. In my view, the more people who sign in this world, the better. And I defy you to suppress a smile when a baby signs \u201cmore\u201d by bouncing her chubby little fingertips together.But part of me also objects when baby signs are marketed in a vacuum, isolated from their origins in the full, rich American Sign Language that I know. The increasingly mainstream trend \u2014 driven by parenting books and how-to videos \u2014 is largely being pushed by hearing people, for the benefit of hearing children. It seems like a major missed opportunity to take advantage of the contributions that deaf people \u2014 the primary users (and originators) of signed languages \u2014 can offer to the world.Leading proponents of baby signing say that it\u2019s a way for parents to develop stronger bonds with their babies, and that it has benefits for language development and cognition, though the evidence for this among hearing children is weak. Signing is also clearly valuable for children whose brains might be better suited to visual rather than verbal communication: not only deaf children, but also those with autism and other forms of cognitive difference.The baby sign language phenomenon connects to what culturally deaf people celebrate as \u201cDeaf Gain:\u201d the notion that all of humanity can gain significant benefits and insights from Deaf visual-spatial contributions to the world, including A.S.L. and all its rich linguistic possibilities. Deaf friends I talk with applaud hearing parents for learning some signs with their children, and express hope that, someday, more people will use a signed language on an everyday basis, making communication easier for all of us.But the developers and users of baby sign language don\u2019t necessarily see A.S.L. fluency as a goal. Many of the books and websites actually assure parents that they don\u2019t need to learn full A.S.L., and also that using baby signs won\u2019t impede a child\u2019s spoken language acquisition.Most striking for me, when I browsed top-hitting baby sign videos on YouTube, I found several that featured stretches of verbal speaking and singalong, without any captions. I was watching visual fragments of my own language, framed by spoken English, which excludes me. I felt disjointed, oddly erased.Finally, there is one more reason I feel ambivalent when my hearing acquaintances tell me they are using baby signs with their children. Often, I notice that these acquaintances are people who have never attempted to use any sign language with me \u2014 even though I am deaf, even though I am the one person they know who could most benefit from visual communication. This omission strikes me as a huge loss, even a huge injustice.When we see sign language as only a fad, a trend or merely as \u201cso beautiful,\u201d and when we separate it from the context of the actual deaf people who use it to communicate, we lose sight of the real stakes of language. Language welcomes, but it also excludes.For decades, medical and educational professionals have discouraged hearing parents from signing with their deaf children. My own parents were told not to sign with me when I was a baby \u2014 and then proceeded to disregard that advice, for which I am exceedingly grateful. Some of these professionals believe that speech is superior and signing is only a crutch for spoken language acquisition, despite the fact that A.S.L. has been recognized as a full language since the 1960s.The consequences of this philosophy of enforced speech for deaf education, literacy and language development have been disastrous: It has meant that many deaf children never acquire a fluent native language that will enable them to reach their potential. This is starting to change, but most deaf children still do not receive full A.S.L. exposure in their early years, which are critical for language acquisition.The fundamental injustice of the baby sign-language trend is that our culture touts the benefits of signing for hearing children, but disregards A.S.L. for the deaf children who need it the most.We need to provide more access to signed language for the people who really need it. As a path toward mainstream acceptance why not give fluent deaf users of A.S.L. more leadership and visibility to usher in the widespread use of their language? (The Baby Einstein signing videos, which star the deaf actress Marlee Matlin, are a good model.) Families who find themselves interested in baby signs may be intrigued by the contributions of deaf storytellers, like Leala Holcomb and her partners at Hands Land or Sheena McFeely and Manny Johnson of ASL Nook, who have put together children\u2019s tales and visual nursery rhymes in A.S.L. And why not invite more people to use A.S.L. throughout their lives?Sign language has untapped potential for enabling richer, more enhanced communication for everyone \u2014 but only if we move past framing it as \u201cbaby talk.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/t-magazine/lauren-ridloff.html", "headline": "From Sign-Language Tutor to Lead Actress", "date": "2018-02-14T16:16:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Lauren Ridloff was born with long, elegant fingers, prompting her musician father and artist mother to predict she\u2019d grow up to do something creative with her hands.

But it\u2019s funny and poignant in ways we haven\u2019t seen before, and more deftly directed and impressively cast than you\u2019d expect for an original series on a small streaming service. It\u2019s also, at six episodes totaling about 150 minutes, an easy binge.The deaf actors Josh Feldman and Shoshannah Stern created and wrote \u201cThis Close,\u201d expanding on an earlier no-budget online series called \u201cFridays.\u201d They also star in it as Michael and Kate, best friends living in Los Angeles. Michael is a gay artist in a downward spiral after a breakup, blocked on his graphic novel and often drunk; Kate is a snarkily funny spitfire who works at a public-relations firm and is engaged to a hearing man, Danny (Zach Gilford), who hasn\u2019t told her that he lost his job.Michael and Kate are also deaf, a fact that is both secondary and central to the show. The questions are universal: Will Kate and Danny find a way to trust each other? Will Michael and his ex, Ryan (Colt Prattes), get back together? Will Michael meet his deadline? But deafness is the inescapable context of each story line, amplifying and complicating the characters\u2019 pain. Being shut out and lied to, as Kate is by Danny, is an even greater betrayal when communicating with the world is your daily struggle.Mr. Feldman and Ms. Stern get their points across in mostly low-key and cleverly comic ways, with an occasional slide into heavy-handedness, usually involving Danny, who\u2019s awfully clueless even by the low standards contemporary dramedies tend to set for straight white boyfriends.Deafness has its benefits, as seen in a shot of Kate and Michael blissfully sleeping on an airplane amid screaming babies and hacking coughers. It also confers the ability to say nasty, smutty things about hearing people right in front of them, which is always good for a laugh. And a lot of things are just funnier when they\u2019re signed rather than said, like \u201cI might or might not have clogged your toilet\u201d or \u201cWhat, are you going to yell at me now?\u201dThe director Andrew Ahn (\u201cSpa Night\u201d) gives the show a languid indie-movie feel. He\u2019s also clearly thought about how to adapt to, and exploit, working with deaf actors. \u201cThis Close\u201d is quiet, but not to an extreme \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of plaintive pop music on the soundtrack, and Ms. Stern voices much of her dialogue.Visually, however, it has a silent-movie quality, with the camera nearly always focusing on the hands and mouths of those speaking or signing, to catch the many varieties of expressiveness. (This takes literal form when a character gives a theatrical, Chaplin-esque performance of signing at the dinner table.) Silent communication also allows for several conversations to take place simultaneously and privately right next to each other, something Mr. Ahn employs for humorous effect.Perhaps more contrived, but still effective: the moment we first hear the normally silent Michael\u2019s voice, which doesn\u2019t come until the season is nearly over.Ms. Stern, a veteran actress known for her roles in \u201cJericho\u201d and \u201cWeeds,\u201d and Mr. Feldman, a writer with little acting experience, are both good, as are Cheryl Hines, Keiko Agena and Mr. Prattes in supporting roles. The pioneering deaf actor Marlee Matlin appears as Michael\u2019s mother, giving a nicely engaging and relaxed performance.As sharp as \u201cThis Close\u201d often is with the details, it also has a dangerous tendency to slide toward clich\u00e9s about things like sex, drinking and workplace dynamics. The closing moments of the season feature a cliffhanger that may reflect a serious danger for deaf people (and that gains an extra dimension from Kate\u2019s obliviousness to what\u2019s happened) but is a head-smacker in dramatic terms.

His name was Lee Duck-hee, and he had first caught the coach\u2019s eye when he was in elementary school.Mapo High\u2019s players pressed against the fence along the dusty hardcourts and chanted their support while Lee crushed forehand winners past his bespectacled opponent in the final. The 6-1, 6-1 victory took little time \u2014 no surprise, given that Lee is the best teenage player in South Korea, and a professional who is ranked 143rd in the world.\u201cSeeing the level of skill, power and returning is totally different than high school level,\u201d said Jeong Yeong-sok, his doubles partner at the tournament.But even among the game\u2019s elite, Lee, 18, is exceptional. He is deaf, and no deaf player in the sport\u2019s professional era has reached these heights.In tennis, simply seeing the ball is believed to be insufficient. Hearing the ball, the top players say, enables faster reactions \u2014 a crucial advantage in a sport where blazingly fast serves and powerful groundstrokes mean that even the tiniest fraction of a second matters.\u201cThere are so many different spins in tennis, and I can hear a lot of them coming off someone\u2019s racket because I know what they all sound like,\u201d said Katie Mancebo, a college tennis coach and volunteer coach for the United States deaf tennis team. \u201cBut a deaf player doesn\u2019t know that sound, so they have to focus more on what the other person is doing, how they\u2019re making contact, and what the ball looks like as it\u2019s coming over the net.\u201dJoo Hyun-sang, the tennis coach at Mapo High School, said he had initially been skeptical of Lee\u2019s potential.ImageLee is continuing his rise despite a big disadvantage: being unable to hear the ball.Credit...Jean Chung for The New York Times\u201cWhen I met him the first time, I had certain doubts that being deaf would prevent him from being a great player,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I grew confident from watching him develop and improve. I was very confident he could do it.\u201dThough already the second-highest-ranked player of professionals 18 and under, Lee has become a breakout star. He has yet to play a main-draw match at an ATP tournament or a Grand Slam, though he reached the final of a Challenger event, the level below the ATP World Tour, for the first time in September in Taiwan, and has made two semifinals since.But if he continues to rise, Lee will debunk much of what is understood about the intricacies of tennis.Studies have shown that humans react more quickly to an auditory stimulus than a visual one. According to research compiled by the National Institutes of Health last year, the mean reaction time to visual stimuli is 180-200 milliseconds, and 140-160 milliseconds for auditory stimuli.At Wimbledon in 2003, Andy Roddick said that his first reaction to an opponent\u2019s shots comes from his hearing, as does his initial information about the shot coming toward him.\u201cYou can hear how hard someone hits a ball,\u201d Roddick said. \u201cIf they hit it hard and flat, it really makes a popping sound. That\u2019s maybe one of the first things that tells you rather than actually seeing the ball. Like trying the drop shot, all of a sudden, I hear it not come off the racket. It\u2019s part of the reaction process. I think you need to hear the ball pretty clearly to play at your highest level.\u201dTodd Perry, an Australian former doubles player who works as a coach, said that he often listens to his players\u2019 shots to hear how strokes can be improved.ImageLee and his mother, Park Mi-ja. She taught him to speak and to read lips, and she committed to help him build a career in tennis.Credit...Jean Chung for The New York Times\u201cWhile coaching, you can hear the clean hit off the racket, and you can change things to make sure you get the clean hit off the racket, which is all just through sound,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you watch different people, the sound from different players is quite different if you put your focus in on that.\u201dIn his seminal 1974 book \u201cThe Inner Game of Tennis,\u201d W. Timothy Gallwey preached attentiveness to the sounds of the sport, describing the feedback loop created by close attention to the sounds of one\u2019s own strokes to replicate the \u201ccrack\u201d of a successful shot.\u201cI learned how effective the remembering of certain sounds can be as a cue for the built-in computer within our brains,\u201d Gallwey wrote. \u201cWhile one listens to the sounds of his forehand, he can hold in his memory the sound that results from solid contact; as a result, the body will tend to repeat the elements of behavior which produced that sound.\u201dMartina Navratilova has been one of the most vehement proclaimers of the importance of sound in the game. She has called excessive grunting cheating because she thinks it unfairly disguises the sound of the ball off the racket. At the 1993 United Open, she blamed the noise from planes passing overhead for interfering with her play.\u201cYou really depend on hearing the ball being hit, particularly when you are at the net,\u201d Navratilova said. \u201cYou first hear the ball. Then you react to the speed and spin according to the sound. And when you can\u2019t hear it, it really throws you off. I did miss some volleys there because I didn\u2019t hear the ball.\u201dAndy Murray also struggled with cacophonous conditions at this year\u2019s United States Open, when rain pounded down on the new roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium.\u201cWe use our ears when we play; it\u2019s not just the eyes,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt helps us pick up the speed of the ball, the spin that\u2019s on the ball, how hard someone\u2019s hitting it.ImageOn Lee\u2019s tennis bag, a keychain made by a fan features the South Korean flag and Lee\u2019s initials.Credit...Jean Chung for The New York Times\u201cIf we played with our ears covered or with headphones on, it would be a big advantage if your opponent wasn\u2019t wearing them. It\u2019s tricky, you know? You can still do it, but it\u2019s harder, for sure.\u201dMurray\u2019s hypothetical example was once put to the test. Tobias Burz, a deaf player who now serves as the technical director for tennis at the International Committee of Sports for the Deaf, recounted an experiment he once conducted with a higher-ranked hearing opponent. After winning their first set, 6-2, his opponent was curious what it was like to be a deaf player, and used earplugs and wore headphones for their next set. Burz won, 6-3.A Surprising DiagnosisPark Mi-ja and her husband, Lee Sang-jin, could tell that their infant son was different, but they were reluctant to seek a diagnosis. Lee Duck-hee had been born while his father completed his compulsory service in the South Korean military, leaving Park alone with her young son. She hoped that whatever was affecting him would pass.Park took her son to a hospital in Seoul for testing when he was 2. \u201cThe doctor just said, \u2018This baby cannot hear anything, he\u2019s deaf,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was very surprised, and I couldn\u2019t react. But I knew I couldn\u2019t go home right away.\u201dPark went to visit her sister, who lived in Seoul, and there she broke down. \u201cFrom the moment I saw her, all the grief and sadness came and I couldn\u2019t stop crying,\u201d she said.After a few hours, she composed herself and called her husband. He drove from Jecheon to Seoul to pick her up. During that ride home, they made the decision not to wallow.\u201cWe started discussing how not to be sad, but instead how we can support and raise Duck-hee,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s our first son. The sadness period was only about a week, and then we were brave enough to move on to the next step, which was researching disability education.\u201dImageAt this year\u2019s United States Open, Andy Murray struggled with the noise of the rain pelting the roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium.Credit...Santiago Mejia/The New York TimesWhen Duck-hee was 4, his parents enrolled him in a school for the disabled in Chungju, an hour away from home. While most students lived in the dormitory there, seeing their families only on weekends, Park was determined to have more time with her son. She drove him the hour to and from school each day, then sent him to a regular school in the afternoons to ensure he was comfortable in a hearing world.\u201cI wanted him to be integrated with normal people,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I saw older students at the deaf school, they only knew sign language, so when they took the bus, they had to communicate with the bus driver by writing something down. And when they become 18, 19 years old, the chances for getting a job are very limited to a person who only speaks sign language.\u201dHaving observed lessons at the deaf school, Park began to teach her son to speak and read lips herself in the evenings, using picture cards of various mouth positions. After a few years, Duck-hee left the school for the deaf completely; as per his parents\u2019 wishes, he never learned sign language.\u201cOnly a few percent of the deaf students can be socialized with normal people, making their own money to live,\u201d Park said. \u201cMost of them, they give up and go back to live with their parents, and the parents have to take care of them. We just wanted Duck-hee to be independent and live as a normal person.\u201dLee Sang-jin had set a record in the 200-meter dash when he competed at the National Sports Festival as a high school student, and saw sports as the best path for his son. He believed his son\u2019s deafness would make a sport that required communication with teammates an impossibility, so he focused on individual sports like golf, archery and shooting. But when Duck-hee went to watch a cousin, Woo Chung-hyo, play tennis, his mind was made up.\u201cI got really interested in watching tennis, and I said, \u2018Oh, why can\u2019t I play?\u2019\u201d Lee Duck-hee said. \u201cMy cousin gave me the racket, I tried some strokes, and I liked it. I was really attracted to tennis; I just liked swinging the racket.\u201dHis parents committed fully, too, placing high stakes on Lee\u2019s nascent tennis career.\u201cIt was not like a hobby or for fun; we were really serious,\u201d Park said. \u201cWhen his father and I had our first meeting with his first coach, we told him that we\u2019re not here just for fun: we\u2019re making his career and a future path. So, please, take these lessons seriously. If he has no chance and no potential, we won\u2019t continue.\u201dImageLee looking at instant messages on a cellphone on his way home after winning a gold medal at the National Sports Festival.Credit...Jean Chung for The New York TimesLee remained based in his family\u2019s apartment in Jecheon, where his mother works as a hairdresser and his father as a reporter, but his tennis began to gain attention nationwide.Even as Lee\u2019s wins piled up through each successive age bracket, many parents and coaches remained doubtful.\u201cNinety percent of the coaching staff and parents and family of other players, they always said Duck-hee cannot reach a professional level,\u201d Park said. \u201cThey always said that this is elementary school level and the ball speed is really slow, so he can do it. But when he reaches professional level the ball speed will be really fast, so he cannot react, because he cannot hear.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe tried not to hear this kind of criticism. Me and my husband, we tried to give him something he can do for his life as a human being. And we didn\u2019t have anything other than tennis.\u201dCollegiate SuccessThough no deaf players have achieved professional success comparable to Lee\u2019s, there have been a handful of deaf and hard-of-hearing tennis players who have excelled at the collegiate level in the United States.Paige Stringer, who founded the Global Foundation for Children with Hearing Loss, played for the University of Washington, where she had a doubles partner who was also deaf. She hypothesized that deaf players\u2019 disadvantage in not being able to hear their opponents hit the ball can be compensated for by increased visual acuity.\u201cPeople who were born deaf or hard of hearing may have a stronger sense of intuition in general, and tend to see subtle clues in a person\u2019s face or body language better than people with normal hearing,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cThey are more visual, because when one sense is compromised, other senses are heightened to compensate. If my hypothesis is correct, people who are deaf or hard of hearing may have an advantage in tennis because they can pick up visual cues faster and better as to their opponent\u2019s plans, and may have better reflexes because they see things sooner.\u201dImageLee raises his racket to catch the attention of the chair umpire during a match. He can compete without much issue on court, save for sometimes not noticing out or let calls.Credit...Jean Chung for The New York TimesHard-of-hearing players often learn most about how important hearing is to their tennis when they are forced to adapt to playing without the hearing aids or cochlear implants they rely on in daily life, which are not allowed at deaf-only competitions like the quadrennial Deaflympics. Having had the experience of playing both with and without sound makes these players uniquely qualified to comment on the role sound plays in their tennis.Evan Pinther, who played for Florida Gulf Coast University, cited the lack of feedback from his own strokes as his biggest cause of discomfort on court when he was restricted from using hearing amplifiers.\u201cMy anxiety level goes up without my hearing aids,\u201d Pinther said. \u201cI much prefer to play with my hearing aids because I can hear the ball so much better. I always loved hearing the ball explode off my strings when I hit it perfectly; it gave me confidence to hear that sound the ball makes when hit well.\u201dEmily Hangstefer, who played for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, also said the adjustment had been frustrating.\u201cTraining for the Deaflympics, I realized I relied on hearing instead of watching or feeling the ball,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me about five weeks to get in the habit of watching the ball instead of hearing it. Once my hearing was taken away, I had to rely on my other senses \u2014 touch and sight.\u201dKeen anticipation has become Lee\u2019s strength. Woo, his cousin and coach, said Lee could read what kind of shot his opponent will make by closely watching his backswing. Christopher Rungkat, a former opponent of Lee\u2019s, expressed awe at his anticipation.\u201cHe always seems to know where I am going to hit the ball,\u201d Rungkat told reporters last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is guessing; it is more like he is reading my mind.\u201dImageLee speaking to a South Korean television reporter after matches at the National Sports Festival. Formal interviews can be burdensome for him.Credit...Jean Chung for The New York TimesStriving to Be the BestReaching a No. 1 world ranking is Lee\u2019s goal, but first he aspires to become the best player in South Korean history, which would mean passing the career high of Lee Hyung-taik, who reached No. 36 in 2007 and won one ATP singles title.Tennis lags behind sports like baseball and soccer in popularity in Asia, and South Korea does not currently host an ATP event. But with Lee Duck-hee and another talented young player, 104th-ranked Chung Hyeon, 20, the Korean Tennis Association hopes the country\u2019s Davis Cup team can rise back into the World Group, from which it was relegated in 2008.Under new leadership, the association hopes that newly secured funding will help players like Lee and Chung, as well as develop juniors by paying for travel to warmer climates during winter months.Lee does not believe that his hearing impairment will hold him back \u2014 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d he said \u2014 but he acknowledged that another physical disadvantage might: At 5 feet 9, he is a shrub amid the redwoods of professional men\u2019s tennis. In an era of increasingly physical competition, only one player in the ATP top 50, 21st-ranked David Ferrer, is as short as Lee. Only six players are under 6 feet.Lee travels with Woo, who serves as a hitting partner and speaks limited English, as he navigates his first laps on the circuit. Woo said that although Lee might sometimes feel intimidated by being one of the youngest on tour, he keeps an unrelentingly positive attitude, and is comfortable interacting with other players socially.While Lee can compete without much issue on court, save for sometimes not noticing out or let calls, other tour regulations may prove challenging. All players are required to participate in news conferences after each match, if requested by the news media.While he is effusive in nonverbal communications across linguistic boundaries, formal interviews can be burdensome for Lee because he must read an interpreter\u2019s lips, and his own speech is often not readily understood. When Lee was interviewed by a Korean television station after a match at the National Sports Festival, the station used subtitles.There can also be benefits to Lee\u2019s unique situation, however.\u201cOf course I do want my player to be treated as a normal player, but we have some opportunities and some advantages from being deaf, business-wise,\u201d said Lee Dong-yeop, his agent. \u201cBecause no one has done this before.\u201dOne of the first boosts came from the car manufacturer Hyundai, which began sponsoring Lee when he was 13 and recently renewed its support through 2020. In a statement, Hyundai said that it was \u201castonished and inspired by his relentless spirit to reach the top as a tennis player despite his handicap of being deaf\u201d and that the company \u201cfelt the responsibility to give him support as a responsible company in the Korean society.\u201dThe funding from Hyundai has given Lee a stable financial base which few developing players enjoy. His agent hoped that increased funds, from prize money and additional sponsorships, might someday allow Lee to travel with a full-time manager and interpreter.\u201cMoney can solve that kind of problem,\u201d he said.Starting Monday, Lee will compete with other Asian players in Zhuhai, China, for a regional wild card into the Australian Open. If he does not win that event, Lee will have another chance to reach his first Grand Slam main draw by winning three matches in the qualifying rounds in Melbourne. With continued success at the Challenger level, his ranking may steadily climb into the Top 100, which would allow him to enter main draws at Grand Slam events directly.Stringer said she believed that there was no reason deaf athletes should be less common in the elite levels of tennis than they are in the general population.\u201cTo reach the top of any sport is limited to a very select group of talented athletes,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a percentages thing. The odds are that more people with normal hearing will be in the Top 150 than those with deafness. I bet Lee Duck-hee\u2019s success has to do with his athletic talents, personality, intelligence, work ethic, opportunities, and the support group he has around him; his deafness is less of a factor than those attributes.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/opinion/the-deaf-body-in-public-space.html", "headline": "The Deaf Body in Public Space", "date": "2016-09-28T07:24:22+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s rude to point,\u201d my friend told me from across the elementary-school cafeteria table. I grasped her words as I read them off her lips. She stared at my index finger, which I held raised in midair, gesturing toward a mutual classmate. \u201cMy mom said so.\u201dI was 6 or 7 years old, but I remember stopping with a jolt. Something inside me froze, too, went suddenly cold.\u201cI\u2019m signing,\u201d I said out loud. \u201cThat\u2019s not rude.\u201dAs the only deaf student in my elementary school, I had already stumbled across the challenges of straddling two languages and two modes of communication. My family was hearing, but they still empowered me by using both English and sign language at home.A sign language interpreter accompanied me throughout the day at school, and my teachers created a welcoming environment for me to learn, but finding a place to belong with kids my own age often felt more difficult. I tried to speak to them, and occasionally they reciprocated the effort by learning some basic signs. But usually I felt separate.I went home that day and asked my mother about what my friend had said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d my mother said, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t know the social rules are different with signing. You aren\u2019t being rude.\u201d With that, matter-of-fact as always, she brought the conversation to an end. But I still felt a lingering self-consciousness, entirely novel and difficult to shake.This was perhaps the first time I realized that other people could see me as obtrusive, as taking up too much space, when I was simply communicating just as I was.When I reflect on this memory two decades later, I recognize how my childhood friend, whom at the time I had found to be so accusatory, had really gaped at me with a sort of wonder. My signing challenged the rules of social conduct she\u2019d absorbed from adults, and to her I must have seemed ignorant or radically rebellious, or perhaps both. But pointing was a truly fundamental act for me; it was how I expressed what my grown-up scholarly self would call relationality \u2014 the idea of being in the world in relation to others. Through sign language, a properly poised finger allowed me to say you and me and he and she and they. If I did not point, how could I make a human connection?Many years later, when I was in graduate school, another conversation with a friend made an impression on me. We were in a cafe having lunch; she was one of those rare friends who had started learning sign language solely to communicate with me. That day over lunch we forfeited spoken English, which we typically used to talk with each other, and practiced conversing with our hands and our facial expressions. I felt a touch of exhilaration; she was putting aside her conventional, ingrained hearingness and coming to meet me in my visual world.But after a few minutes, my usually bold, un-self-conscious friend stopped. She chuckled and shrugged a little, and said, \u201cI feel like everyone here is looking at us.\u201dI glanced around the small cafe, at all the hearing people sitting at their tables. Indeed, some had craned their necks to look at our movements, but this was behavior I\u2019d long ago ceased to notice. \u201cYeah,\u201d I signed back, bluntly. \u201cThat often happens.\u201dMy friend smiled. A moment later, we started conversing again, and I think then she understood: This is what it can be like to occupy a signing body.To use sign language, to embrace it in non-signing public spaces, one must sometimes push against ideas of having committed a gross indiscretion. These notions, I confess, haunted my relationship with my body for years after my childhood friend told me not to point. How obvious signing was, how indiscreet in the \u201cconventional\u201d sense: what I was pointing at, my lively facial expressions, my sense of physical restraint! I was already shy as a child, reluctant to put myself on display. So for a while I felt embarrassed, but then learned not to be. This happened out of necessity, out of self-acceptance and, frankly, joy in my own signing body, but for other nonnative signers it happens out of choice. As several other hearing friends have told me since, when they sign with me in public they feel rather conspicuous. \u201cShould I do this?\u201d they ask me. \u201cIs it too much?\u201dToo much: To me these words succinctly articulate the taboos that can linger about bodily expressiveness. Hearing culture presents us with ideals of speaking with good elocution, restraint and self-control. Now, I admit, I see these ideals as visually impoverished, inaccessible and uninteresting: They produce spaces full of immobile talking heads, disembodied sound and visual inattentiveness. Those qualities become the optical equivalent of speaking in a monotone. As much as I also enjoy spoken words, allowing my body to speak for itself feels, simply, more real. Even if that means signing is sometimes read as a visual spectacle.My hearing friends, who have often never had to cope with being looked at, can struggle the most with this sense of spectacle. When they learn to sign with me \u2014 and there are still too few who really learn \u2014 they must overcome these cultural taboos about excessive movement, pointing and gesture. Over the years, I have kept a mental list of the comments they make at the beginning stages.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with my hands. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve just discovered I have them.\u201d\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s O.K. to point? At him?\u201d\u201cI am trying to be more expressive. My face just feels like it can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThat feels weird.\u201d\u201cHow do your eyes take in so much information, so fast?\u201dAnd finally: \u201cI feel self-conscious. I feel like you are looking at me.\u201dYes, I want to tell people who regale me with that last comment. Yes, I am looking at you, because what would the point be otherwise?Over time, I hope that the direct gaze comes to feel as affirming to my hearing companions as it does to me. When I sign, when I use my body to communicate, it indeed elicits a different state of mind, one that invites and guides the physical gaze, but this need not feel discomforting or unwelcome. On the contrary: looking at me, at my body and everything it says, shows me that you are paying attention. We meet each other in the midst of this physical and linguistic self-expression, and our connection surpasses a disembodied voice and expands to include our entire beings. Right here, looking back at you, I feel like I have made contact."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/us/nc-trooper-being-investigated-for-shooting-of-deaf-man.html", "headline": "N.C.

The driver succumbed to his injuries at the scene.\u201dImageAn image of Daniel Kevin Harris from a YouTube video.Credit...CBSnews, via YouTubeThe authorities declined to provide any further information about the nature of the encounter between Mr. Harris, who was white, and Trooper Saunders, who is black, or to say whether the trooper believed his life was in danger before he opened fire.Investigators have not commented on what role Mr. Harris\u2019s disability may have played, but his brother said he believed his death was the product of a police department that does not know how to interact with those who are deaf or hard of hearing.\u201cBeing shot by the police is just not acceptable,\u201d the victim\u2019s brother, Sam Harris, who is also deaf, said through an interpreter during a video interview with Reuters. \u201cIf the officer had known that he was deaf, it would have ended differently, and he would still be around with family, and life would be going on. He\u2019d be happy.\u201dBut on Tuesday, Frank L. Perry, secretary of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, urged the public to \u201crefrain from making assumptions or drawing conclusions prior to the internal and independent reviews.\u201d\u201cAny loss of life regardless of the circumstances is truly a tragic and sad event for all involved,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhile the Highway Patrol, the State Bureau of Investigation and the district attorney\u2019s office conduct their respective reviews, we are keeping all those affected by this tragedy in our thoughts and prayers.\u201dJay Ruderman, the president of the Ruderman Family Foundation, which works for the rights of people with disabilities, said police departments needed to train officers to respond to the needs of the disabled.\u201cPeople with disabilities will be safer the more the police are properly trained in this regard, and it needs to happen now before more tragedies occur,\u201d Mr. Ruderman said in a statement. \u201cWhether a person is deaf, autistic or has a chronic health problem, these disabilities are often not understood by police officers when encountering them on the streets.\u201dInvestigators from the bureau of investigation interviewed Trooper Saunders on Tuesday night and planned to meet with Mecklenburg County\u2019s district attorney, R. Andrew Murray, in the coming days, said Shannon O\u2019Toole, a spokesman for the bureau. He said Trooper Saunders had been placed on administrative leave.The agency investigates 90 to 95 percent of the officer-involved shootings in the state, Mr. O\u2019Toole said, and when it \u201cis requested to conduct an officer-involved shooting investigation, we do so, with the intent that each and every case is going to trial.\u201dThe Associated Press reported on Wednesday that since 2008 Mr. Harris had been charged with traffic offenses and other misdemeanors, including petty theft, in Connecticut, Florida and Colorado. In 2010, he pleaded guilty to speeding in Florida and also pleaded guilty to interfering with or resisting the police in Connecticut, The A.P. said."}, {"url": "https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/parents-of-deaf-children-stuck-in-the-middle-of-an-argument/", "headline": "Parents of Deaf Children, Stuck in the Middle of an Argument", "date": "2016-05-24T21:40:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\n                                    \n                                        Photo\n                                            \n                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                            Nyle DiMarco, left, a contestant on \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d shown here with professional dancer Peta Murgatroyd, is an advocate for American Sign Language.\n                                                Credit Getty Images\n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        Photo\n                                            \n                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                            Credit Getty Images\n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                        \n                                            Well Family\n                                            Welcome to Well Family, Well\u2019s new home for news about parenting, child health and relationships with advice from our experts to help every family live well.\n                                            \n                                                Sign up for our Well Family newsletter.\n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                    A long-simmering controversy erupted this spring over how deaf children should communicate.\n                                    It started when The Washington Post ran\u00a0a story on Nyle DiMarco,\n                                        the deaf\u00a0\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d\u00a0contestant who is also an advocate for American Sign Language (ASL). When Meredith Sugar, president of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for\n                                        the Deaf and Hard of Hearing,\u00a0retorted that ASL was becoming obsolete in light of better hearing aid and cochlear implant technology, the arguing\n                                        went public. But that debate was really just the latest manifestation of a longstanding conflict among deaf people and parents of deaf children: Should children be fitted for hearing aids and taught to speak, or\n                                        should they use sign language? Or a combination of both?\n                                    As the parent of a 2-year-old whose hearing loss was recently diagnosed, the arguments only heightened my anxiety about how to address my son Sam\u2019s needs. After his diagnosis, Sam\u2019s doctors assumed he\n                                        would get hearing aids, which he would need for the rest of his life. ASL was not mentioned as an option. Because Sam has residual hearing \u2014 his loss is mild in one ear and moderate to severe in the other\n                                        \u2014 I went along with their recommendation.\n                                    One friend, a speech therapist whose brother is deaf, told me not to sign at all with Sam because he would use it as a crutch instead of learning to speak. This made sense to me, and for a while after Sam was aided,\n                                        his therapist, a teacher of the deaf, focused on his listening and speaking skills. The hearing aids gave him more access to sound, but he still had trouble processing all that new information and figuring out how\n                                        to replicate it through spoken language.\n                                    Although his speech did improve, the frustration I continued to see in his face when he tried to tell me something was heartbreaking. Tantrums were frequent. Sam started coming up with his own signs, such as a chomping\n                                        motion with his arms when he wanted to wear his dragon shirt. He was searching for any way to communicate.\n                                    So, I asked his therapist about incorporating sign. But instead of using ASL, which is its own language with a grammatical structure different from that of English, she advised \u201csigned English.\u201d This incorporates\n                                        ASL signs but in a way that mimics spoken language. Although some children are taught to be bilingual in ASL and English, ASL is not designed to represent English directly. The benefit of learning signed English,\n                                        Sam\u2019s therapist said, is that he could sign and speak at the same time. Plus, when it comes time to learn to read, it\u2019s not as much of an adjustment. \u201cLearning ASL and then learning to read\n                                        English is very tough,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be like learning Chinese.\u201d\n                                    I\u2019ve come to think of signing as a tool for Sam to learn English. The majority of the world is hearing. Only two to three children out of 1,000                                        are born with hearing loss, and more than 90 percent of them to hearing parents. Those who say not teaching ASL to hard-of-hearing children is language deprivation only vilify parents who are trying to find a bridge\n                                        between the hearing and deaf worlds.\n                                    And it\u2019s hard for parents like me to know which world their hard-of-hearing child\u00a0should\u00a0be in \u2013 or even what words to use to talk about it. Because Sam had some hearing I hesitated\n                                        to refer to him as \u201cdeaf.\u201d Many deaf people\u00a0feel the term \u201chearing impaired\u201d implies a deficit and focuses on a disability, so I settled on \u201chard-of-hearing.\u201d But after\n                                        talking with an advocate for deaf children in the New Jersey Early Intervention System, I realized there is not a clear delineation between deaf and hearing \u2014 it\u2019s more like a spectrum. \u201cWhen\n                                        you say \u2018mild hearing loss,\u2019 people think it\u2019s easily fixable,\u201d she told me. \u201cIn fact, children with mild or moderate loss sometimes have an even more difficult time because they\n                                        can hide their inability to hear.\u201d\n                                    Hearing aids aren\u2019t perfect, and certain situations, like a noisy classroom or restaurant, will still be difficult.\u00a0As an alternative, many in the Deaf community \u2014 who capitalize the \u201cD\u201d\n                                        to indicate a sense of unity and celebration \u2014 embrace their lack of hearing as an identity, avoid hearing aids and amplification altogether and focus on ASL. In this sense, being Deaf is more than a specific\n                                        state of hearing; it\u2019s being part of a specific culture that\u2019s inclusive of those with mild as well as profound hearing loss. Many Deaf people feel well-meaning parents are pushed by doctors, audiologists\n                                        and groups like AG Bell to try to make their children fit in with the hearing world through technology. But as Sam\u2019s audiologist said to me,\u00a0\u201cLots of people have glasses, so why should hearing\n                                        aids be thought of any differently?\u201d\n                                    Although in principle she may be right, hearing aid use in children, which requires years of visits with doctors, audiologists and speech therapists, remains controversial. Sam\u2019s doctor told me that some in the\n                                        Deaf community would think it\u2019s \u201cchild abuse\u201d for her to perform cochlear implant surgery, the next step in technology if over-the-ear aids aren\u2019t effective. \u201cThey\u2019d have\n                                        me thrown in jail,\u201d she said. This anti-technology attitude means that many parents who choose aids or implants wonder where their kids fit in. They\u2019re not quite hearing, not quite deaf, and maybe\n                                        not even Deaf.\n                                    Instead of a united front advocating for deaf and hard-of-hearing children, I\u2019ve found a community struggling with internal conflict. As in politics, extremists on either side have created an environment that\n                                        makes it hard for those in the middle to feel comfortable discussing the issues. I\u2019m making decisions for my son, but I\u00a0don\u2019t know whether he will agree with them when he\u2019s older. But what\n                                        would help parents the most is a community that could talk openly to work through the options without judgment or dogma. What would best benefit my son \u2014 and me, in making choices for him \u2014 is better\n                                        support for whichever decision we make.\n                                    Tina\u00a0Donvito\u00a0is a freelance writer who blogs at\u00a0foggymommy.com.\n                                    Interested in more Well Family?

Though, to the credit of the cast, even the pieces that wane don\u2019t lack for trying.That cast is made up of four deaf and four hearing actors, in a production by New York Deaf Theater. As in the new \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d on Broadway, the group uses both spoken English and American Sign Language; sometimes the lead actors sign while their words are spoken by others in the cast. Other times the lead actors speak while interpreters sign their dialogue. Here and there they employ a combination of methods.It\u2019s intriguing for a hearing audience member to experience, and the approach even enhances a few of the seven plays, notably \u201cTime Flies.\u201d In the quirky comedy, May and Horace, two mayflies, philosophize about their short lives. The actors (as May, Anne Tomasetti signs, Stefanie Anarumo speaks; as Horace, Darren Fudenske signs, Forrest Weber speaks) work together seamlessly, and are delightful to see and hear.\u201cEnigma Variations,\u201d about a bizarre visit to a doctor, is almost as funny, and just as smartly staged. In the best pieces, the combined languages create a kind of poetry, while the synchronized movements fashion a kind of ballet.Other plays, however, just aren\u2019t suited to the process. (All were written by Mr. Ives years ago for hearing actors, and adapted by the company for this production.)\u201cLives of the Saints\u201d and \u201cThe Mystery at Twicknam Vicarage\u201d suffer when intervals between the spoken and signed words undermine the comic timing. \u201cArabian Nights,\u201d in which one character is an interpreter, may seem a natural fit for the troupe, but it too is uneven. (Several pieces could be eliminated, especially since the total running time is nearly two and a half hours.)Liarra Michelle, Onudeah Nicolarakis, Chris Ogren and Christopher Tester round out the cast, directed by Garrett Zuercher. The work of all eight performers in the title play and in \u201cBabel\u2019s In Arms\u201d is an impressive display of ensemble acting.After the show you can\u2019t help wondering how the troupe would handle other projects: a commissioned full-length, maybe, or a program of Beckett shorts.

India and Pakistan are talking a lot these days, mostly about why they don\u2019t want to talk to each other. Our national security advisers were supposed to meet last week. And they were supposed to talk about terrorism. Instead, they did what they do best: They hurled accusations at each other about how the other side doesn\u2019t really know how to talk, and the meeting was canceled.India accuses Pakistan of sponsoring terrorism in India. Pakistan accuses India of sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan, and of having bad manners. To India, it seems obvious that Pakistani militants were behind the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, and it is exasperated that the world won\u2019t punish Pakistan for that. It is upset that the man accused in the attacks, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, was released on bail after a leisurely trial in Pakistan, and was able to produce a baby while in prison. India is also upset that the plot\u2019s alleged mastermind, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, is allowed to roam freely, addressing rallies despite the bounty the American government has placed on his head.In its own defense Pakistan points to all the hundreds of suspected terrorists it has killed in the last year and a half. It reminds India that some 60,000 Pakistanis have been killed by terrorists. India responds by saying: You are only killing the terrorists who kill Pakistanis while protecting the terrorists who kill Indians.Lurking under this neighborly rage are stereotypes that refuse to fade. India thinks Pakistan is an aging terrorism addict that keeps hitting up the world for loose change so it can get its next fix. Pakistan thinks India is an old uncle who has come into some money late in life but still doesn\u2019t know how to dress. India says Pakistan is the pesky kid who is always picking a fight in the neighborhood. Pakistan says India is the real bully \u2014 and if you don\u2019t believe it, go ask the other kids on the block: Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal. Still don\u2019t believe it? Go ask the Kashmiris. India says no one should ask the Kashmiris anything because Pakistan has poisoned their minds.India would like the world to make Pakistan stand in a corner of the classroom and again and again write on the blackboard, \u201cI have been a bad boy.\u201d Pakistan claims the dog ate its homework, and that it is busy hunting the dog down. Pakistan wants the world to believe that it has changed. India wants the world to remember that Pakistan supported the Taliban and sheltered Osama bin Laden.While the two governments aren\u2019t talking to each other, their pundits shout from both sides. It\u2019s not pretty. Indians: You are protecting Saeed. Pakistanis: You elected a prime minister some have accused of inciting deadly religious riots in Gujarat; before he became prime minister, the man wasn\u2019t even allowed into the United States. Indians: You are practically hostage to your army and intelligence agencies. What do you know about democracy?After that the level of debate really rises. Pakistan accuses India of being jealous of Pakistan\u2019s close friendship with China and their recent deal over an economic corridor. India says it\u2019s Pakistan that\u2019s jealous, because India is the new China.This line of reasoning has held for nearly 70 years. Three generations have lived either with war or the imminent threat of war.A bunch of alleged Pakistani gunmen storm the Indian Parliament, and we are on the brink of war. Some dead Pakistani Taliban are found to be uncircumcised, and are declared agents of India. A few months ago the Indian media ran triumphant reports of Indian security forces capturing a Pakistani spy pigeon.Some among India\u2019s latest breed of democrats and bureaucrats fantasize about India sending an elite commando into Pakistan to take out Saeed, like the United States did with Osama bin Laden. Pakistan reminds them that it has nuclear bombs. India says its nuclear bombs are bigger and better. Are these two nuclear powers talking to each other, or are they two teenagers playing a game of dare?Maybe it\u2019s time India and Pakistan did away with the pretense that they want peace. Hundreds of miles of barbed wires on the border, countless searchlights and mile-long visa forms haven\u2019t made us feel secure about each other.Pakistanis who have visited India or met a real-life Indian will tell you, \u201cThey are just like us.\u201d Indians say the same of Pakistanis. Which makes all of them sound as though they had been expecting to discover a nation of feral animals.Then again, in large parts of India and Pakistan, there is no enmity and there is no love. Most people don\u2019t even make much of the fact that the two countries are neighbors.As a Pakistani when you fill out an Indian visa form, you are required not only to give your father\u2019s name but also information about your grandfather and grandmother if they were Pakistani. A few years ago while I was traveling to India to attend a literary festival, I was stopped at an immigration desk in Mumbai airport. The authorities were on the lookout for another Mohammed Hanif whose father shared the same name as my late dad\u2019s.After a long interrogation about my ancestors I was asked to write a statement on a plain piece of paper: \u201cI, Mohammed Hanif, son of Mohammed Siddiq, am not the Mohammed Hanif son of Mohammed Siddiq who is wanted in India.\u201d I happily wrote and signed and was allowed in. It is true that some of our ancestors took to mass murder at the time of partition. But many more didn\u2019t. Maybe we should all write our names and our fathers\u2019 names over and over, to keep reassuring one another that we are here not to kill, but to talk."}, {"url": "https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/spring-awakening-is-to-return-to-broadway-in-deaf-west-production/", "headline": "\u2018Spring Awakening\u2019 Is to Return to Broadway in Deaf West Production", "date": "2015-07-07T18:00:15+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\n                                    \n                                        Photo\n                                            \n                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                            John Gallagher Jr., center, in the 2006 Broadway production of \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d at the Eugene O'Neill Theater.Credit                                                Sara Krulwich/The New York Times\n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d is returning to Broadway.

She was 88.Her death was announced by her alma mater, Gallaudet University, in Washington. At her death, Ms. Norton was an emeritus professor at Ohlone College in Fremont, where she taught English, psychology and drama.Ms. Norton was a founding member, in 1967, of the National Theater of the Deaf. The company\u2019s formation was a watershed moment in the employment of deaf actors, who had enjoyed steady work in the silent-film era but had been marginalized with the coming of talkies.The National Theater of the Deaf was the first company to present regular productions in American Sign Language. Today used by hundreds of thousands of deaf people in the United States and parts of Canada, A.S.L. arose spontaneously among deaf Americans in the early 19th century. But by the 1960s, it had long been stigmatized as a crude pidgin English. At the time, its myriad grammatical complexities \u2014 as rich as, though quite different from, those of English \u2014 were only dimly understood.Ms. Norton acted in many of the company\u2019s productions, including two evenings of one-acts that came to Broadway in 1969. The first included an adaptation of \u201cThe Tale of Kasane,\u201d a Japanese work, in which she played one of a pair of lovers on whom the action centers; the second included signed renditions of poems by William Blake, Lewis Carroll and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, with Ms. Norton signing Browning\u2019s \u201cHow Do I Love Thee?\u201dIn both productions, narrators translated the action into spoken English for the benefit of hearing audience members.Ms. Norton, often described as the first deaf actor to be cast on a network television show, had guest roles on several staples of the 1960s and \u201970s. Among them were \u201cMannix,\u201d on which she played a deaf woman who reads the lips of a man in the act of plotting a kidnapping; the long-running sitcom \u201cFamily Affair\u201d; and \u201cThe Streets of San Francisco.\u201dIn the late 1970s, she and her husband, Kenneth Norton, who is also deaf, auditioned for the roles of the mother and father in \u201cMom and Dad Can\u2019t Hear Me,\u201d an ABC Afterschool Special about a hearing teenager (played by Rosanna Arquette) with deaf parents.As Ms. Norton recounted in \u201cHollywood Speaks: Deafness and the Film Entertainment Industry\u201d (1988), by John S.

The Nortons responded with a public battle, filing a complaint with the Screen Actors Guild and rallying other deaf actors to the cause.The protest was of no direct help to Ms. Norton, who \u2014 possibly as a consequence \u2014 did not work in television again. But by raising public awareness of the work of deaf actors, it demonstrably helped pave the way for the generation that followed, including Marlee Matlin, who won an Oscar in 1986 for \u201cChildren of a Lesser God.\u201dIn 1989 The Los Angeles Times reported that before the fight over \u201cMom and Dad Can\u2019t Hear Me,\u201d only 33 percent of deaf characters on TV were played by deaf actors, compared with 78 percent a decade later.Audree Lauraine Bennett was born on Jan. 13, 1927, in Great Falls, Mont. When she was 2, a bout of spinal meningitis left her deaf. With her mother, she moved to Minnesota, where she attended what is now the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf in Faribault.She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in English from Gallaudet College, as it was then known, in 1952, and married Mr. Norton, a classmate, that year. She received a master\u2019s in rhetoric and public address from California State University, Hayward, in 1976.Ms. Norton began her acting career at midcentury as an on-camera model, appearing in TV commercials for Kodak and Royal Crown Cola, accompanied by a hearing actor\u2019s voice-over.Besides her husband, Ms. Norton\u2019s survivors include a daughter, Nikki; a son, Kurt; two grandchildren; and a great-grandchild. Another son, Dane, died in 1990.She was awarded an honorary doctorate from Gallaudet in 2012."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/opinion/bina-shah-a-new-language-for-pakistans-deaf.html", "headline": "A New Language for Pakistan\u2019s Deaf", "date": "2015-04-01T10:06:59+0000", "source": "International New York Times", "text": "KARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 With one national language, Urdu, four provincial tongues (Sindhi, Punjabi, Pashto and Balochi), and nearly 300 regional dialects, Pakistan\u2019s linguistic diversity is like a beautiful carpet, interwoven with threads ancient and young. The regional languages developed over thousands of years, while Urdu came from northwestern India in the 12th century. Then, in 1947, English was made an official language as a legacy of British rule in India.Now a small group of educators of the deaf intends to add one more language \u2014 this one not spoken. It is called Pakistan Sign Language, and its creators just may succeed in spreading its use across the country.Schools for the deaf have existed in Pakistan since the 1980s; one of the largest in Karachi is the Absa School and College for the Deaf, where initial research was conducted to develop Pakistan Sign Language, or P.S.L., as it is known here. A Pakistan Association of the Deaf, with chapters in many cities and towns, was formed in 1987, when deaf people in Pakistan were not just misunderstood; often they were shunned or ostracized by people who considered them mentally handicapped and unsuited for normal life.In the same decade, Richard Geary Horwitz, an American, and his wife, Heidi, from the Philippines, moved to Pakistan from India and added a new dimension to deaf education. They are the parents of a boy who had been born deaf, and for years they had worked with the deaf in the Philippines and in New Delhi. While visiting Karachi in 1984, they learned that their expired Indian visas would not be renewed. So they stayed here and started a program called Deaf Reach in a small classroom with 15 children from Karachi\u2019s slums as well as their son, Michael. From it grew the Family Education Services Foundation, a network of seven schools that now stretches across Karachi, Hyderabad, Rashidabad, Sukkur and Nawabshah in the province of Sindh, as well as Lahore in Punjab.Today, Pakistan\u2019s Deaf Reach schools educate nearly 1,000 students, and additional foundation programs offer vocational and technical training, parent training and teacher education.It is, of course, not enough. There are an estimated 1.25 million deaf children in Pakistan, and Deaf Reach schools educate a small fraction of them. Still, the project is considered a success when measured against Pakistan\u2019s bleak educational landscape. It is, after all, a nonprofit network with its own curriculum that delivers high-quality education to a specialized community. Pakistani companies and foreign aid organizations have enthusiastically donated money, and U.S.A.I.D. donated $250,000 last year to help build the Deaf Reach school in Rashidabad.Inside the Deaf Reach schools, an emotional and social revolution is on view every day. Students are treated not as \u201cspecial,\u201d but as normal. The one thing that sets a Deaf Reach classroom apart is that the lessons take place in complete silence. Students and their teachers \u2014 half of whom are deaf themselves \u2014 communicate in sign language, a graceful ballet of hands synchronized with moving lips and lively facial expressions.One key to their success is the invention of Pakistan Sign Language. Another is the use of digital media.A common Indo-Pakistan sign language was in use across the subcontinent long before the 1980s, but many words and concepts in Urdu and other regional languages had no place in it. Pakistan Sign Language grew out of this need, but by the late 1990s the books and guides developed by Absa were deemed outdated and went out of print. So the family education foundation worked with deaf instructors in Punjab and Sindh, and with Rubina Tayyab, the head teacher at the Absa School, to develop a new online lexicon that now contains 5,000 words and phrases. On its website, a new video each day shows men, women, girls and boys signing a phrase with its meaning repeated in English and Urdu. Aaron Awasen, the foundation officer in daily charge of the P.S.L. project, describes this lexicon not as a definitive dictionary, but as \u201ca portal through which Pakistan Sign Language can continue to develop.\u201dMaking technology central is typical of the Deaf Reach system. The online tools are accompanied by a book, a CD and a phone app. Computers and televisions are prominent in classrooms, and teachers are encouraged to explore the Internet for supplementary materials.The P.S.L. tools imprint three languages \u2014 Urdu, English and P.S.L. \u2014 on the children\u2019s brains at the same time. They also enable relatives and others to learn P.S.L. even if they can\u2019t attend regular training sessions. Meanwhile, a publicity campaign called \u201cDon\u2019t Say It, Sign It\u201d shows Pakistani celebrities like the filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and the cricket star Shahid Afridi signing simple phrases in short online video clips, in an effort to remove the stigma of \u201cotherness\u201d and incapacity from the common perception of the deaf.Ten thousand copies of the organization\u2019s dictionary and DVDs have been distributed across Pakistan, and a second edition is in print. Next, the foundation will send \u201cdeaf leaders\u201d to 25 cities to meet with their deaf communities and provide materials for smaller villages. By distributing 18,000 P.S.L. books and 7,000 DVD sets, the organization hopes this first phase of its project will affect 150,000 people.In a country like Pakistan, where so many other languages and communities jostle for space, and a walk down any street reveals a modern-day Tower of Babel, what does it mean to give an entire community its own language? If \u201ca loss of language is a loss of culture,\u201d as Mr. Awasen says, then the gain of a language is a gain in culture. So empowering the deaf can only strengthen Pakistan\u2019s social fabric; the deaf community will be proud to take its rightful position within the constellation of diversity that is one of Pakistan\u2019s greatest assets."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/nyregion/weather-briefings-put-focus-on-mayor-de-blasios-sign-language-interpreter.html", "headline": "Sign-Language Interpreter for Mayor de Blasio Is a Web Hit", "date": "2015-01-28T14:03:37+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Even amid the grim news of doomsday forecasts and subway closings, New Yorkers who tuned in to Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s televised storm briefings found themselves distracted by the unusual activity on one side of the screen.That would be Jonathan Lamberton, the mayor\u2019s sign-language interpreter, whose arsenal of rapid gesticulations, vigorous frowns and mime-like smiles \u2014 a stark contrast to the mayor\u2019s sober mien \u2014 raced around social media this week, earning equal parts awe and amusement.\u201cThat guy nailed it,\u201d Jon Stewart declared on Tuesday\u2019s \u201cDaily Show,\u201d which featured a compilation of Mr. Lamberton\u2019s more theatrical moments.

And he told environmental advocates that in order to make a credible case for such climate policies, officials would need to acknowledge Americans\u2019 worries about the economic effects.\u201cPeople don\u2019t like gas prices going up; they are concerned about electricity prices going up,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a speech at an annual dinner for the League of Conservation Voters. \u201cIf we\u2019re blithe about saying, \u2018This is the crisis of our time,\u2019 but we don\u2019t acknowledge these legitimate concerns \u2014 we\u2019ve got to shape our strategies to address the very real and legitimate concerns of working families.\u201dClimate change remains among the few policy items he can push through without action from Congress, and the issue is likely to define the remainder of his time in office.Mr. Obama also said Wednesday that he recognized that even as he pushed the United States to cut its carbon pollution, emissions were soaring in developing economies, particularly in India and China, as those nations seek to lift millions of people out of poverty.\u201cThe trade-offs for them are tougher than for us unless we describe how development should leapfrog the old sources of energy,\u201d the president said. He emphasized that the United States should take the lead in developing low-carbon sources of energy that would give poorer economies better access to electricity without increasing their carbon pollution.At the State Department, diplomats are working toward a global carbon-cutting deal to be signed in 2015, and Mr. Obama said nations would be lured to the negotiating table if the United States managed to cut carbon pollution without hurting the domestic economy.\u201cWhen America proves what\u2019s possible, other countries are going to come along,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama again mocked officials who question or deny the established science that human activity, particularly the burning of coal and oil, cause climate change.\u201cIn communities, they may not know how big a problem climate change is, but they generally don\u2019t say, \u2018I don\u2019t believe anything scientists say\u2019 \u2014 except in Congress,\u201d he said.Democrats have increased attacks on Republicans who deny human involvement in climate change, seeing it as a winning political strategy. Polls by the League of Conservation Voters and other groups show that younger voters in particular associate candidates who deny climate science with being out of touch.Just three weeks ago, Mr. Obama announced a landmark Environmental Protection Agency regulation aimed at slashing planet-warming carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, the nation\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. But the rule faces substantial legal, political and legislative attacks, and Republicans have criticized it as a \u201cwar on coal\u201d that will drive up energy prices and eliminate jobs in the coal industry.The administration has begun an aggressive public relations effort to help sell the new proposal to the public, and environmental groups are gearing up to back politicians who embrace the rule. A major part of that campaign will be to convince Americans that climate change poses as much of a threat to the nation\u2019s economy as it does to the environment.That effort was aided this week by the release of a report laying out the economic threats posed by human-caused climate change. The report, written by a team of economists and analysts, was financed by a bipartisan team of financiers \u2014 the billionaire Tom Steyer, who is campaigning to elect politicians who push climate policy; former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., who served as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush.In particular, the report highlighted soaring costs for the insurance industry and taxpayers as more extreme storms batter the coasts, and the expenses that farmers and consumers will face as increased drought devastates farmland and reduces crop yields.On Tuesday, Mr. Obama\u2019s top advisers and cabinet members, including his counselor, John Podesta; Treasury Secretary Jack Lew; Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and the senior adviser Valerie Jarrett met with the backers and authors of the report and with top officials from the insurance industry to discuss the economic consequences of increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/arts/phyllis-frelich-deaf-activist-and-actress-dies-at-70.html", "headline": "Phyllis Frelich, Tony-Winning Actress and Deaf Activist, Dies at 70", "date": "2014-04-15T00:26:31+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Phyllis Frelich, the actress who made a groundbreaking and Tony-winning Broadway star turn in 1980 in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d Mark Medoff\u2019s play \u2014 written with her and her husband\u2019s help \u2014 about the courtship and marriage of a deaf woman and a man who can hear, died on Thursday at her home in Temple City, Calif., near Los Angeles. She was 70.Robert Steinberg, her husband, said the cause was progressive supranuclear palsy, known as PSP, a rare brain disorder whose cause is largely a mystery and for which there is no known effective treatment.Mr. Medoff had already written a number of plays, including the 1973 Off Broadway hit \u201cWhen You Comin\u2019 Back, Red Ryder?,\u201d when he met Ms. Frelich, who was deaf, in 1978, introduced by her husband, a scenic designer. A member of the National Theater of the Deaf, she told him that there were no substantive roles for deaf actresses. Captivated by the possibilities, he promised to write one. Sign language, he thought, was inherently theatrical, and the struggles of the deaf to make themselves understood would be a poignant example of the complexities of all human communication. \u201cShe was so animated and vivid, she made me immediately want to be able to converse with her,\u201d Mr. Medoff said in an interview on Monday. \u201cI was swept away.

Mr. Medoff had observed it at close hand: the couple moved to Las Cruces, N.M., where Mr. Medoff was chairman of the drama department at New Mexico State University, and lived there for six months. \u201cI\u2019ve always said the two of them and I were of equal importance in creating that play,\u201d Mr. Medoff said.\u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d won the 1980 Tony Award for best play, Ms. Frelich won the Tony for best actress in a play, and her co-star, John Rubinstein, won for best actor. The play ran for two years, during which Mr. Steinberg, who was Mr. Rubinstein\u2019s understudy, made his own Broadway debut. Phyllis Annetta Frelich was a leap year baby, born on Feb. 29, 1944, in Devils Lake, N.D. Her father, Phillip, a typesetter for the local newspaper, and her mother, Esther, a seamstress, were both deaf. Phyllis was the oldest of nine deaf children. She attended the North Dakota School for the Deaf in Devils Lake and Gallaudet College (now Gallaudet University) in Washington, where her degree was in library science but her main interest was theater. David Hays, a founder of the National Theater of the Deaf in 1967, had seen her perform at Gallaudet and asked her to join the company, which was then based at the O\u2019Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn. It was there that she met Mr. Steinberg. They married in 1968. In addition to him, Ms. Frelich is survived by her siblings: four sisters, Shirley Egbert, Peggy Camp, Priscilla O\u2019Donnell and Pamela Campbell, and four brothers, Dennis, Merrill, Timothy and Daryl. She is also survived by two sons, Reuben and Joshua, and a grandson. In 1986 \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d was made into a film, starring William Hurt and Marlee Matlin. Ms. Matlin won an Oscar for her performance in the role played onstage by Ms. Frelich.Mr. Medoff wrote other plays for Ms. Frelich, including \u201cThe Hands of Its Enemy,\u201d in which she played a high-strung playwright, and \u201cPrymate,\u201d which appeared on Broadway in 2004, in which her character, an anthropologist, befriends a gorilla she has taught to sign. She also appeared on Broadway in 2003 in a revival of the 1985 musical \u201cBig River,\u201d in which all the actors used sign language. Ms. Frelich starred with Mare Winningham and Ed Waterstreet in the 1985 television movie \u201cLove Is Never Silent,\u201d the story of deaf parents of a daughter who can hear, and she had a recurring role in the television soap opera \u201cSanta Barbara.\u201d She made guest appearances on numerous television series, including \u201cBarney Miller,\u201d \u201cL.A. Law\u201d and \u201cER.\u201d Her most recent appearance was on \u201cCSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\u201d in 2011.\u201cBy then her illness was affecting her,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said. He added that he hoped her death would bring attention to the disease, which also afflicted the actor Dudley Moore, and to CurePSP, an organization devoted to solving its mysteries. \u201cShe was tough and fierce and strong-willed and beautiful,\u201d Gordon Davidson, who directed \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d on Broadway, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe were talking two different languages, and I was amazed at the need to communicate, and the energy of communicating came out in the form of sign language. It was overwhelming for everybody, and it was a truly glorious and humbling experience.\u201d "}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/health/a-sons-deafness-prompts-a-scientific-journey.html", "headline": "A Son\u2019s Deafness Prompts a Scientific Journey", "date": "2014-04-14T17:54:32+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Like almost all newborns in this country, Alex Justh was given a hearing test at birth. He failed, but his parents were told not to worry: He was a month premature and there was mucus in his ears. A month later, an otoacoustic emission test, which measures the response of hair cells in the inner ear, came back normal.Alex was the third son of Lydia Denworth and Mark Justh (pronounced Just), and at first they \u201creveled at what a sweet and peaceful baby he was,\u201d Ms. Denworth writes in her new book, \u201cI Can Hear You Whisper: An Intimate Journey Through the Science of Sound and Language,\u201d being published this week by Dutton.But Alex began missing developmental milestones. He was slow to sit up, slow to stand, slow to walk. His mother felt a \u201cvague uneasiness\u201d at every delay. He seemed not to respond to questions, the kind one asks a baby: \u201cCan you show me the cow?\u201d she\u2019d ask, reading \u201cGoodnight, Moon.\u201d Nothing. No response.At 18 months Alex unequivocally failed a hearing test, but there was still fluid in his ears, so the doctor recommended a second test. It wasn\u2019t until 2005, when Alex was 2 \u00bd, that they finally realized he had moderate to profound hearing loss in both ears.This is very late to detect deafness in a child; the ideal time is before the first birthday. Alex\u2019s parents took him to Dr. Simon Parisier, an otolaryngologist at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, who recommended a cochlear implant as soon as possible.\u201cAge 3 marked a critical juncture in the development of language,\u201d Ms. Denworth writes. \u201cI began to truly understand that we were not just talking about Alex\u2019s ears. We were talking about his brain.\u201dToday Alex is an active 11-year-old who, like his older brothers, is a student at Berkeley Carroll, a private school in Brooklyn. He plays basketball, baseball \u2014 whatever sport is in season. With the implant and a hearing aid, his hearing is within the normal range. He scores 100 percent on a speech recognition test, though this does not mean he hears the way hearing children do.Ms. Denworth, 47, is a science writer by profession, and her book explores both what happened to her own child and the relationship between the brain and sound and language.She and I met one chilly March day at her Park Slope brownstone, a fire in the living room radiating warmth. (Like Alex, I use a cochlear implant and a hearing aid, as I relate in my own book, \u201cShouting Won\u2019t Help: Why I \u2014 and 50 Million Other Americans \u2014 Can\u2019t Hear You.\u201d)Alex\u2019s hearing loss is a result of a rare congenital condition called Mondini dysplasia, in which the cochlea fails to form completely. It is often accompanied by a second condition, enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome. Because the vestibular system also controls balance, Mondini and the syndrome probably contributed to Alex\u2019s delayed gross motor skills.Marc Marschark, a professor at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester, says that no matter whether deaf children were born to deaf parents who use sign language, or whether they have implants and hearing aids, \u201cthe one constant is that they are all still deaf.\u201dDr. Marschark hypothesizes that deaf children use their brains differently from hearing children. They quickly learn to pay attention to the visual world, and that leads to differences in brain structure. \u201cDeaf children are not hearing children who can\u2019t hear,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are subtle cognitive differences between the two groups.\u201dDavid B. Pisoni, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Indiana University School of Medicine, has been studying children with cochlear implants for 22 years. (The first F.D.A. clinical trials on pediatric cochlear implants were done at this center.) He is interested in cognitive processing \u2014 learning and memory, attention, language comprehension and production \u2014 in deaf children. For children with cochlear implants, success in these areas is highly variable, he said, stressing the \u201chighly.\u201dThis variability in cognitive success affects academic achievement. Although some deaf children do very well academically, an alarming number do not. The median reading level by age 18 in deaf children \u201chas not changed in 40 years,\u201d as Dr. Marschark put it. It remains stuck at fourth-grade level.Studies have found that deaf children from families who identify themselves as culturally deaf, and use American Sign Language, are generally on a par with hearing children in terms of reading, because they have been exposed to language since birth. But 95 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents. Those children have no exposure to language until they get a cochlear implant or are entered into an American Sign Language program. Early exposure to language is crucial to learning to read. Those studies of 18-year-olds may yield very different results when children who were implanted at 6 months or a year reach that age.There are difficulties. For the 5 percent born to deaf parents, learning to read is complicated by the lack of a written form of sign language. Written English is essentially a different language.Children with hearing aids or cochlear implants, on the other hand, speak the same language they are learning to read, and can benefit from phonics. But cochlear implant surgery cannot be done earlier than 6 to 8 months, so deaf children have no exposure to language during that time. And the devices are imperfect, leading to further hurdles to understanding language.Alex received his implant relatively late, but he benefited from having some residual hearing, and he has grown up in a language-rich environment, two factors that predict success in reading. As Anne Fernald at Stanford has shown, the more a child is talked to, the better he will read.\u201cWhatever Alex missed by the delay,\u201d Ms. Denworth told me, \u201che\u2019s made it up. It\u2019s partly that he\u2019s lucky. Would he be in better shape if he\u2019d had more sound earlier? Maybe.\u201dOr maybe not. Dr. Marschark and Peter C. Hauser ask rhetorically in the book \u201cDeaf Cognition\u201d: \u201cAre there any deaf children for whom language is not an issue?\u201d From my own experience, I would ask if there are any deaf adults for whom language is not an issue.Alex came home from school as Ms. Denworth and I were finishing up. He sat down to talk with us for a few minutes. He seemed a little shy, and he had a very quiet voice \u2014 so quiet that I couldn\u2019t hear it and his mother had to repeat some of what he said. But what he said was uncannily similar to my experiences as a deaf adult.I asked him what bothered him most about hearing loss. \u201cWhen someone says, \u2018Never mind,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he replied, without hesitation. I laughed. For me, I said, it\u2019s \u201cNever mind, it\u2019s not important.\u201dDoes he read lips? He wasn\u2019t sure, but he said he could hear better when he was looking at someone. I asked if his friends made a special effort when they talked to him. \u201cThe kids in my class are kind of loud,\u201d he said. Loudness does not equal intelligibility.Asked if he liked the country, where his family has a large working farm, he replied, \u201cThe country is easier on my ears.\u201d And he loves the beach. \u201cSitting on the beach late at night when there\u2019s nobody there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s noisy but I like to hear the waves.\u201dAlex\u2019s experience shows what many implant users know. \u201cThe cochlear implant itself is not the magic bullet,\u201d his mother said. \u201cIt just gives you access to sound, and then you have to work at it.\u201dAlex is working at it, and it seems clear he will do fine."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/arts/music/renowned-japanese-composer-mamoru-samuragochi-admits-fraud.html", "headline": "In Japan, a Beloved Deaf Composer Appears to Be None of the Above", "date": "2014-02-06T11:52:28+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "TOKYO \u2014 He was celebrated as a prolific musical genius whose compositions appeared in popular video games and the competition routine of a top figure skater in the coming Sochi Olympics. His deafness won him praise as Japan\u2019s modern-day Beethoven.It turns out his magnum opus was his own masquerade.On Thursday, Japan learned that one of its most popular musical figures, Mamoru Samuragochi, 50, had staged an elaborate hoax in which someone else had secretly written his most famous compositions, and that he had perhaps even faked his hearing disability.Across a nation long captivated by Western classical music, people reacted with remorse, outrage and even the rare threat of a lawsuit after Mr. Samuragochi\u2019s revelations that he had hired a ghostwriter since the 1990s to compose most of his music. The anger turned to disbelief when the ghostwriter himself came forward to accuse Mr. Samuragochi of faking his deafness, apparently to win public sympathy and shape the Beethoven persona.The scandal began on Wednesday, when Mr. Samuragochi publicly confessed that someone else had written his most famous works. These include Symphony No. 1 \u201cHiroshima,\u201d about the 1945 atomic bombing of his home city, which became a classical music hit in Japan; the theme music for the video games Resident Evil and Onimusha; and Sonatina for Violin, which the Japanese Olympic figure skater Daisuke Takahashi is scheduled to use in his performance in Sochi.The timing could hardly have been worse for Mr. Takahashi, a potential medalist who won the bronze in the Vancouver Olympics four years ago. He said in a statement that he would continue to skate to the musical piece \u2014 he really had little choice given all the time and work needed to prepare an Olympic routine \u2014 and hoped the revelations would not overshadow his performance.\u201cTakahashi and the people involved with him did not know about this incident,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis is a crucial time just before the Olympics.\u201dOn Wednesday, Mr. Samuragochi expressed remorse for the deception, though he did not reveal why he chose to come forward at that particular moment.\u201cSamuragochi is deeply sorry as he has betrayed fans and disappointed others,\u201d said a statement released by Mr. Samuragochi\u2019s lawyer. \u201cHe knows he could not possibly make any excuse for what he has done.\u201dVideo{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"@id\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000002692797/samuragochis-work-now-in-question.html\",\"description\":\"Mamoru Samuragochi, who won fame for overcoming deafness to write music, confessed many of his best-known works were ghostwritten.

Then his ghostwriter said he was not actually deaf, either.CreditCredit...Jiji Press, via Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesThe reason for this sudden repentance became clear on Thursday when the ghostwriter revealed himself to be Takashi Niigaki, 43, a largely unknown part-time lecturer at a prestigious music college in Tokyo. Mr. Niigaki said he had written more than 20 songs for Mr. Samuragochi since 1996, for which he received the equivalent of about $70,000.He said he felt so guilty about the deception that he had threatened to go public in the past, but Mr. Samuragochi had begged him not to. He said he finally could not take it anymore when he learned one of his songs would be used by the Olympic skater. He told his story to a weekly tabloid, which went on sale Thursday.\u201cHe told me that if I didn\u2019t write songs for him, he\u2019d commit suicide,\u201d Mr. Niigaki told a crowded news conference. \u201cBut I could not bear the thought of skater Takahashi being seen by the world as a co-conspirator in our crime.\u201dPerhaps just as shocking was Mr. Niigaki\u2019s assertion that Mr. Samuragochi was never deaf. Mr. Niigaki said that he had regular conversations with Mr. Samuragochi, who listened to and commented on his compositions. Mr. Niigaki said the deafness was just \u201can act that he was performing to the outside world.\u201dRepeated calls and faxes to Mr. Samuragochi\u2019s lawyers after Mr. Niigaki\u2019s news conference were not answered.It was unclear exactly how Mr. Samuragochi duped the world since asserting he went deaf in the late 1990s. No one, it seemed, suspected the onetime child music prodigy had not composed his own work. But in past interviews with the news media, Mr. Samuragochi gave an explanation that might explain why no one ever doubted his hearing loss: He said he was completely deaf in one ear, but had some hearing in the other that was assisted by a hearing aid.The scandal has brought an abrupt fall from grace for Mr. Samuragochi, a man who looked the part of a modern-day composer with his long hair, stylish dark suits and ever-present sunglasses.Much of Mr. Samuragochi\u2019s appeal seemed to lie in his inspiring life story, especially for a country so fascinated by classical music. Japan is the birthplace of the Suzuki method, and international superstars like the conductor Seiji Ozawa and the pianist Mitsuko Uchida are the source of great pride. Tokyo alone has about 10 professional orchestras, and the Japanese in the past have been among the biggest buyers of recorded classical music.The public adored Mr. Samuragochi, who appeared to have overcome a serious physical disability, the loss of almost all of his hearing at age 35 because of a degenerative condition, to achieve musical greatness. In a 2007 autobiography titled \u201cSymphony No. 1,\u201d Mr. Samuragochi described himself as the son of an atomic bomb survivor and able to play Beethoven and Bach on the piano by age 10.ImageTakashi Niigaki, Mr. Samuragochi's ghostwriter.Credit...Eugene Hoshiko/Associated PressMr. Samuragochi seemed to reach the height of his popularity last year, when Japan\u2019s public broadcaster, NHK, aired a documentary titled \u201cMelody of the Soul: The Composer Who Lost His Hearing\u201d that followed him as he met survivors of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan.He regularly appeared in many major news media, including Time magazine, which quoted him in a 2001 interview as saying that the loss of hearing turned out to be \u201ca gift from God.\u201d\u201cI listen to myself,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cIf you trust your inner sense of sound, you create something that is truer. It is like communicating from the heart.\u201dThe disclosure of his deception brought a wave of apologies by major Japanese news media outlets, which expressed regret about failing to uncover Mr. Samuragochi\u2019s deceit.\u201cWe want him to explain his behavior,\u201d said the Japanese daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun in a mea culpa published Thursday, \u201cbut the media must also consider our own tendency to fall for tear-jerking stories.\u201dThe episode also shook Japan\u2019s struggling music industry, for whom Mr. Samuragochi had offered a rare respite from declining sales of classical CDs. The Hiroshima symphony sold 180,000 copies in a classical music market where sales of 10,000 constitute a hit.The music company Nippon Columbia said in a statement that it was \u201cappalled and deeply indignant\u201d and would stop selling his CDs. Orchestras across Japan said they were canceling concerts that featured Mr. Samuragochi\u2019s music. One, the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra, said it was considering a lawsuit to retrieve lost ticket sales, an extreme expression of anger in nonlitigious Japan.The mayor of Hiroshima also threatened to strip Mr. Samuragochi of a \u201ccitizen\u2019s award\u201d that the city had given him for promoting the city\u2019s message of opposing nuclear weapons.\u201cWe never imagined this,\u201d the mayor, Kazumi Matsui, was quoted as telling the daily newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun. \u201cWe are aghast.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/sports/football/inspired-and-already-trying-to-be-the-nfls-next-deaf-player.html", "headline": "Showing Deaf Players They Fit In, Too", "date": "2014-01-30T18:02:44+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "NEWARK \u2014 Hearing aids in, lip-reading skill at the ready, Derrick Coleman, a Seattle Seahawks fullback, fielded question after question from reporters at Super Bowl media day.

What Coleman did not know is that about 30 miles from where he sat, it already had.When Coleman runs on the field for the Super Bowl\u00a0on Sunday, Adham Talaat will be watching in Bridgewater, N.J., from the living room of the family that is hosting him while he trains for May\u2019s N.F.L. draft. Though Coleman contributes mostly on special teams, Talaat \u2014 a 6-foot-6, 280-pound defensive end \u2014 will keep his eyes focused on him at all times, willing him to make plays.Talaat says he is sure that Coleman\u2019s success will help pave the way for his own, as well as for other deaf players like them.\u201cBefore Derrick Coleman, where did we have a deaf role model like that? Who did we have to look up to, in terms of athletics, in terms of professional sports?\u201d Talaat said Wednesday after a six-hour training session. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anybody. Why? It\u2019s not because we\u2019re not capable of playing professional sports. So you tell me why.\u201dHere are a couple of reasons. It most likely starts in youth leagues, where coaches might be hesitant to welcome a boy who is different from the rest, and where other children often equate \u201cdifferent\u201d with \u201cscary.\u201d It\u2019s a good bet that bullies have long teased talented athletes away from sports like football before they could develop into high school and college stars, let alone professionals. Who knows what we\u2019ve missed out on?Changing attitudes and stereotypes always takes something bold. But it also takes confidence on the part of athletes like Coleman; proactive parents like his mother, who made a special effort to explain to his teachers and coaches how to include her son; and coaches like Seattle\u2019s Pete Carroll, who took a chance on him, just as he would with any other player.Coleman\u2019s successes put him in position to face the challenge of the N.F.L., which has never been quick to adapt to players who didn\u2019t fit into the traditional mold. And now players like Talaat are hoping to follow in his footsteps.Talaat said he never had a deaf role model until he became aware of Coleman when they were in high school. Coleman was a rising star. It took Coleman that long to build the confidence to wear his hearing aids and not be embarrassed by them. Before high school, other children teased him because he was different, and many times as a boy he went home crying. His mother told him not to listen. His father told him to ignore the bullies by shutting off his hearing aids.Coleman ended up playing at U.C.L.A., where he was a standout. And he never gave up on playing in the N.F.L., not after going undrafted, not even after the Minnesota Vikings signed him but cut him in training camp. The Seahawks picked up Coleman in December 2012.Carroll said that Coleman\u2019s hearing loss has \u201cnever been a factor\u201d and that Coleman simply told him: \u201cPlease, there may be a time when I don\u2019t hear you, but don\u2019t get frustrated. I\u2019ll get it.\u201dThe Seahawks, who play in one of the league\u2019s loudest stadiums, have made minor accommodations. Quarterback Russell Wilson knows to take out his mouthpiece in the huddle, so Coleman can read his lips. To ensure he has the right play, Coleman repeats it to his teammates.\u201cTo not be able to hear that well and be able to process things and make plays, and to have him in the huddle, it kind of gives me chills to be honest with you,\u201d Wilson said.ImageAdham Talaat,\u00a0a 6-foot-6, 280-pound defensive end, became a two-time academic all-American at Gallaudet University.Credit...Tara Lanning/Gallaudet University AthleticsColeman\u2019s story, told in a moving commercial for Duracell batteries, can give you goose bumps.In the ad, Coleman says: \u201cThey told me it couldn\u2019t be done, that I was a lost cause. I was picked on and picked last. Coaches didn\u2019t know how to talk to me. They gave up on me. Told me I should just quit. They didn\u2019t call my name. Told me it was over. But I\u2019ve been deaf since I was 3, so I didn\u2019t listen.\u201d\u00a0When Talaat saw the ad, he immediately thought, Whoa, that\u2019s me!Talaat, like Coleman, is a talented underdog who has had to overcome huge obstacles to get where he is. He is severely to profoundly deaf, and he said he is able to hear only very loud noises \u2014 like fire alarms \u2014 if he is not wearing his hearing aids. Even with them, he cannot make out the words when he listens to music.As a defensive end who did not start playing football until high school, he was offered one college scholarship \u2014 to the University of Massachusetts. But when the coach who recruited him left, Talaat no longer felt he fit in, and he dropped out.He took time off to train and to look for another college that would take him, moving back in with his parents in Springfield, Va. Gallaudet University in Washington soon reached out, but only because a high school teammate was applying there and dropped Talaat\u2019s name.At Gallaudet, a university filled primarily with deaf and hard of hearing students, Talaat excelled on the field and in the classroom. He became a two-time academic all-American, and in 2013 he helped the Bison reach the N.C.A.A. Division III playoffs for the first time in Gallaudet\u2019s 150-year history.Now, Talaat is training at the TEST Parisi Football Academy in central New Jersey, and is one of a group of prospects preparing for the N.F.L. draft. Like Coleman, he says wearing hearing aids is no big deal, that it is just like wearing glasses. And like Coleman, he said his hearing loss should not change anyone\u2019s perception of him, or any other deaf player.He wants \u2014 he expects \u2014 to be judged on ability alone, on what he can do, not what he can\u2019t.Talaat was not invited to the N.F.L. scouting combine, but he is hoping to impress scouts at a private workout.Coleman did it.

It is evident in the affronted set of those boulder shoulders that here is someone who has never, ever been disobeyed.You just know that whether on the battlefield, at court or in the bedroom, Lear has always had only to crook his finger \u2014 and Mr. Langella knows how to crook \u2014 to have his every whim acted upon. And now, what\u2019s this? Lesser mortals are ignoring the king\u2019s demands, as if he were just anybody. Make that nobody. And that\u2019s a shock to the system from which this aged monarch will never recover.In Angus Jackson\u2019s straightforward storybook version of \u201cKing Lear,\u201d which opened Thursday night at the Harvey Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, there\u2019s not much doubt about what drives its title character around the bend. It\u2019s the realization that he\u2019s no longer the most important guy in the room.While this production may have originated at the Chichester Festival Theater in England, it seems an apt cautionary fable for New York, world capital of success-bloated egos. So hurry on down to the Harvey, all you C.E.O.s, media moguls and above-the-title types. And consider the possibility that the day may come when you ask the outraged question, \u201cDo you know who I am?,\u201d and there\u2019s only empty air for an answer.Embodying this cruel lesson comes naturally to Mr. Langella, even if portraying a naked soul in existential pain does not. Throughout his long career, this trophy-accumulating actor has made an intricate study of the warping effects of power. He has created a memorable gallery of domineering men who make the mistake of believing they are invulnerable, from a certain seductive vampire (onstage and screen as Dracula, in the late 1970s) to President Richard M. Nixon (in the theater and film versions of Peter Morgan\u2019s \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d).Mr. Langella improbably turned 76 this month, but he retains a mighty strength to command (not to mention the ability to remember a whole lot of weighty words). The great revelations in Mr. Jackson\u2019s generally unsurprising \u201cLear\u201d come from watching its star translate the reflexes of tyranny into different keys.Other recent interpretations of Shakespeare\u2019s greatest tragic monarch (including Sam Waterston\u2019s at the Public Theater in 2011) have suggested that Lear is already afflicted by senility when the play begins. With Mr. Langella, the problem appears to be less physiological, or even psychological, than societal. This Lear isn\u2019t suffering so much from old age, per se, as from having lived all those years without once being contradicted. In the opening scene \u2014 when he unwisely cedes his land to his scheming daughters, Goneril (an icy-eyed Catherine McCormack) and Regan (Lauren O\u2019Neil) \u2014 he has a lupine fierceness and physicality; you expect him to bite as well as bark and howl. This is a hands-on Lear, who grabs, shakes, throttles and slaps those (including his much-loved daughter Cordelia, played by Isabella Laughland) who won\u2019t bend to his will.ImageFrank Langella in \"King Lear.\"Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesHe doesn\u2019t have the language or the equipment to deal with people in any other way. When Goneril and Regan rebel against him, he just turns up the volume, as if the rest of the world had gone deaf. Even raging at the elements, in a stage-drenching storm scene, he\u2019s still recognizable as the same thwarted titan, shouting to be heard.This approach sets us up nicely for Lear the mad philosopher of the later scenes. Wearing a crown of grass and tattered undergarments, he continues to speak the speech of command, but with a quiet, marveling irony that acknowledges how absurd such directives are. Mr. Langella is at his most inspired in these scenes, cradling his blinded friend Gloucester (Denis Conway) in his arms, fading in and out of cognizance.Yet a part of me couldn\u2019t help wondering if this Lear wasn\u2019t mad by craft, like Hamlet, waiting to exact revenge. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m so accustomed to Mr. Langella\u2019s playing cunning and devious men. But for me, the evolution the king undergoes here is more intellectual than emotional. And while I was often intrigued and stimulated by Mr. Langella\u2019s Lear, I was only occasionally moved. Some of that response may come from a general lack of nuance among the supporting cast members, who include Steven Pacey as Kent, Max Bennett as the evil Edmund, and Harry Melling (Dudley Dursley in the Harry Potter movies), who unexpectedly plays Lear\u2019s Fool as a young whippersnapper. (Could he be Lear\u2019s secret son?) Their performances are all clear and lively, but they tend to strike one note and hold it. As designed by Robert Innes Hopkins, with astute lighting by Peter Mumford and swelling music by Isobel Waller-Bridge, the production recalls Ye Olde England costume movies from Warner Bros. in the late 1930s. (I kept expecting Claude Rains or Basil Rathbone to show up.) The show also includes such crowd-grabbing features as a steady simulated rainfall (credited to Water Sculptures) and a very vivid rendering of the blinding of poor old Gloucester. (Each of his gouged-out eyes lands with an audible splat.) Yet within this conventional framework, Mr. Jackson provocatively moves a notoriously difficult character to the play\u2019s center. That\u2019s Edgar \u2014 the dutiful son of Gloucester and duped brother of the ambitious, illegitimate Edmund \u2014 whose shucked self is allowed to end this production\u2019s first half and begin its second. Played by Sebastian Armesto with a dopey na\u00efvet\u00e9 that grows into hard and horrified consciousness, Edgar is the one who disguises himself as Tom of Bedlam, a near-naked lunatic who roams the land as a beggar.It is the sight of the homeless, mud-smeared Tom on the heath that inspires the outcast Lear to ponder the state of \u201cunaccommodated man\u201d and to realize that we are all thus, in essence, even if our royal cloaks conceal it. Mr. Langella\u2019s eyes, which had been wide with inchoate rage, memorably narrow into the focus of recognition. His gaze holds the anguished yet oddly satisfied astonishment of a long-deluded man who has at last stumbled upon the consolations of philosophy. If Lear should still be inclined to ask, \u201cDo you know who I am?,\u201d he could now provide the answer himself: He\u2019s nothing, which in the cosmic context of \u201cLear,\u201d also means he is all of us."}, {"url": "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/feigning-deafness-giving-your-dogs-email-and-other-reader-tips-to-thwart-privacy-grubbers/", "headline": "Feigning Deafness, Giving Your Dog\u2019s Email and Other Reader Tips to Thwart Privacy Grubbers", "date": "2014-01-14T16:43:59+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\n                                    \n                                        Photo\n                                            \n                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                            One Times reader said he gives retailers the email address he created for Billy, his dog. \u201cI can always tell who is sharing my e-mail address that way,\u201d he said.\n                                                Credit Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    After venting my frustrations with an (admittedly very sweet) cashier lady and the entire data mining industry last Friday, I was\n                                        thrilled to hear from hundreds of simpatico readers who had experienced similar, frustrating encounters\u00a0and a few who weren\u2019t afraid to administer some digital justice of their own.\n                                    Many wanted to know whether the email address I volunteered to the kind sales lady \u2014 privacyreporter@stopaskingme.com \u2014 was real.

Or between Hope and Faith, just a short walk from Eternity. At Restaurante Gallegos, one of several restaurants with similar names, prospective diners often call to ask, \u201cAre you the one on Dead Man\u2019s Corner?\u201dThe city today is a traffic-choked, graffiti-smeared, hyperbolically violent capital where spasmodic bouts of modernization over the years have left little of the colonial charm of some other South American cities. Yet Caracas is also an urban palimpsest, where its past character can still be read amid the concrete.Here buildings have names instead of numbers. Yet street names are unknown to many people, including, at times, the name of the street they live on. As a result, asking directions can lead to a long recitation of landmarks, like a Hemingway short story: \u201cGo past the pharmacy to the top of the hill till you see the big tree and turn right. ...\u201dAnd in one of this city\u2019s most endearing quirks, the street corners themselves have names, often ones that point to a colorful history.\u201cIn all of Venezuela there\u2019s only one Dead Man\u2019s Corner,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Goncalves, 77, the owner of a butcher shop there. On a map, Mr. Goncalves\u2019s shop is at the intersection of East 14 and South 5 Avenues. But no one, he said, uses those names. If he needs to tell someone where his shop is, he simply says to look for him on Dead Man\u2019s Corner.\u201cThat never fails me,\u201d he said. Even his telephone bill comes addressed that way.As with many of the intersections in this part of Caracas, there are multiple stories, or legends, to explain how Dead Man\u2019s Corner got its name. A customer in Mr. Goncalves\u2019s store one recent morning declared that many years ago a dying man asked to have his wake held at that intersection.Not so, said Mr. Goncalves, who has owned the shop for 38 years. There used to be a brass plaque on the outside of his building, he said, put up by the city to tell the story \u2014 although, this being Caracas, it was stolen long ago. The plaque, he recalled, said that there had been a deadly epidemic in the city. Soldiers were sent out to collect the dead, and as they were passing this spot with a cart piled with bodies, one of the supposed cadavers sat up and cried out to let people know he was not as dead as he seemed.Another version, told in a book called \u201cThe Corners of Caracas,\u201d published in the 1950s, says that the name is derived from one of the civil wars that ravaged Venezuela in the 19th century. A battle between rival bands left the dead rotting in the streets. As some soldiers were carrying what they thought was a corpse to the cemetery, the man sat up in the stretcher and said, \u201cDon\u2019t take me to be buried, because I\u2019m alive.\u201d The panicked soldiers, the book says, dropped their load and dashed off.The names, which apply to all the corners at an intersection, are found only in the center of the city, in an area radiating from the old colonial main square. A popular pocket-size book of maps says there are 305 of them.Some corners fit their names.Misery Corner is down at heel. A building painted bright green and yellow stands at Parrot Corner. The main office of the national prosecutor is halfway between Mercy and Keep Your Eyes Peeled.Others corners do not.On a recent morning two drunks fought, flailing at each other ineffectually, at the corner known as Eternity. The Corner of the Upside-Down Christ is wholly nondescript (the legend goes that a shoemaker whose shop was once there was short on work, so, following local tradition, he turned a small statue of Christ in his workshop upside down to \u201cpunish\u201d it for not sending him more clients).ImageDead Man's Corner. \u00a0\u201cIn all of Venezuela there\u2019s only one Dead Man\u2019s Corner,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Goncalves, 77, the owner of a butcher shop there.Credit...Meridith Kohut for The New York TimesSome corners come in groups.A person walking along South 15 Avenue (almost certainly unaware of the street name) will go past a series of corners in this order: Checkpoint Corner, Danger Corner and Keep Your Eyes Peeled. In past years the walker could have gone one block farther to reach Off With Your Underpants Corner, which was eliminated when a school was built on the spot.Alex Reyes, 31, an assistant in a pharmacy two doors from Keep Your Eyes Peeled Corner, said the names reflected the area\u2019s edgy reputation at the time they were coined. He speculated that there was once a police checkpoint at the corner of that name and that the farther away one got from the checkpoint the more perilous things became, until the spot where the thieves were so ruthless they stripped people bare.Asked if Keep Your Eyes Peeled was still a dangerous spot, he laughed and gave a typically fatalistic response, characteristic of a city with one of the highest murder rates in the hemisphere, \u201cThese days, any part of Caracas is dangerous.\u201dThe corner names reflect the city\u2019s preoccupations. There are more than two dozen named after saints, and there are corners named for the Rosary, Charity, Faith and Eternity.Some reflect the urban landscape, past or present: Hospital, New Bridge, the Old Barracks, the Brewery, the Steps.Some are named after animals: there is a Lion, a Vulture and the Corner of the Little Birds (one that might take on new resonance now that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has famously said that his dead predecessor and mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, visited him in the form of a little bird).Some names conjure stories. The Corner of the Lonely Soul is rather far from the Corner of God\u2019s Grace and uncomfortably close to the Corner of the Lion.Others are simply intriguing: Trick Corner, Fat Lady, Deaf Man, the Duck\u2019s Tail, Joy.Caracas is a Caribbean city with vivacious people and often glorious weather. But 14 years of self-proclaimed revolution have produced a city that, like the country beyond, is deeply divided between government supporters and opponents. Corruption and bad management have left large parts of the city in poor repair, and unremitting violence \u2014 murders, muggings and kidnappings are epidemic \u2014 has severed the ties of many people, especially in the middle class, to their city.\u201cCaracas was something you saw through your car window, through the window of your house,\u201d Stefany Da Costa, 29, said. \u201cPeople stopped walking in the city.\u201dLast year, Ms. Da Costa and a friend, Adriana Arias, 29, started a company called Urbanimia, giving walking tours of Caracas landmarks and becoming part of a movement to retake and reassess Caracas. Their most popular route covers the street corners and the stories behind them.Mr. Reyes, who works in the pharmacy at Keep Your Eyes Peeled, said that the corner names were a welcome holdover from the days when Caracas was a small city known for its colorful tile roofs. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of another era, of the Caracas of red roofs, when everyone treated each other properly and with respect, when people greeted each other with \u2018good morning\u2019 and \u2018good afternoon,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a simpler time.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/us/nebraska-deaf-student-wins.html", "headline": "Nebraska: Deaf Student Wins", "date": "2013-09-05T03:57:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": " Creighton University violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act when it failed to provide accommodations requested by a deaf medical student, a federal district court jury in Omaha ruled Wednesday.

Rather, he simply could not hear.Mr. Argenyi, 26, is legally deaf. Despite his repeated requests to use an interpreter during clinical training, administrators at the Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, Neb., have refused to allow it. They have contended that Mr. Argenyi, who is able to speak, communicated well enough without one and that patients could be more hesitant to share information when someone else was present. They added that doctors needed to focus on the patient (not a third party) to rely on visual clues to make a proper diagnosis.Mr. Argenyi took a leave of absence at the end of his second year, in 2011, after suing Creighton for the right to finish his medical training with an interpreter. The case, scheduled to go to trial on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Omaha, is attracting the attention of the federal government and advocates who are concerned that it could deal a setback to continuing efforts to achieve equality for people with disabilities.\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand so much of the communication in the clinic,\u201d Mr. Argenyi wrote in an e-mail. \u201cIt was humiliating to present only half of a history because I had missed so much of what was communicated. I was embarrassed every time I would miss medicine names that I knew from classes but couldn\u2019t understand when the patient or a colleague spoke them.\u201dDespite making tremendous strides over the past four decades with the passage of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, those with disabilities remain underrepresented in higher education and in the work force. In the medical field, people who are deaf or hard of hearing remain less likely to hold high-skilled positions than those without impairments. Universities tend to provide requested accommodations after admitting a student who they know has a disability, proponents for the deaf say. And most arrangements for the deaf are settled long before any issues reach a courtroom, said Curtis Decker, the executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, a federally financed association of legal services programs.ImageMichael Argenyi is on leave from Creighton UniversityCredit...Katherine Taylor for The New York TimesBut, he said of Mr. Argenyi\u2019s lawsuit, \u201cIt\u2019s a very important case because, I think, if it\u2019s successful it will send a very powerful message to the university community that the law does cover them and the law is clear about the accommodations that they need to provide.\u201dCreighton officials maintain that they have provided Mr. Argenyi with the necessary tools for him to succeed in medical school.\u201cMichael Argenyi is a very bright, capable young man who Creighton believes will make a good doctor,\u201d said Scott Parrish Moore, the lead counsel for Creighton.After being accepted to Creighton four years ago, Mr. Argenyi asked the university to provide a real-time captioning system for lectures and a cued speech interpreter. (Mr. Argenyi, who does not know sign language, can read lips. An interpreter helps by mouthing words while using hand signals to clarify sounds.) These were the same accommodations that Mr. Argenyi, who had a diagnosis of profound deafness when he was 8 months old, received for much of his schooling, from grade school through undergraduate studies at Seattle University.Creighton provided Mr. Argenyi with just one of the aides that his audiologist had recommended \u2014 an FM system, which amplifies the sounds he hears in cochlear implants. The university also provided note takers for lectures, priority seating and audio podcasts.Soon after classes began, Mr. Argenyi told school officials that the accommodations were inadequate and that he was missing information. He sued in federal court in Omaha in September 2009, arguing that the university was legally required to pay for and provide necessary aides.Mr. Argenyi said he hired his own interpreter and transcription service, which cost him more than $100,000 during his two years in medical school. The breaking point, he said, came during his clinical work in his second year when Creighton refused to allow him to use an interpreter, even if he paid for it himself. The university did allow Mr. Argenyi to use interpreters during a couple of clinics while the Justice Department was trying to broker a settlement, but stopped when a deal could not be reached. Mr. Argenyi is pursuing degrees in public health and social work at Boston University, which is providing his requested transcription services, while the lawsuit is pending."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/nyregion/suit-accuses-new-york-starbucks-of-discriminating-against-deaf-patrons.html", "headline": "Deaf Patrons\u2019 Suit Accuses Starbucks of Discrimination", "date": "2013-08-08T21:07:41+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "The Starbucks coffee shop on Astor Place is an airy, communal retreat where the regulars huddle with their laptops, reconnect with friends and exchange water-cooler gossip over foam lattes.But Miu Ng, who is deaf, found the coffeehouse decidedly unwelcoming when she wrote down her order for an iced coffee on a slip of paper and tried to hand it to a man behind the counter. He put his hand in her face and waved her away, she said.Veronica Bitkower, who is also deaf, said that when she used her voice to order a black coffee, she was met with a cold stare that \u201cthrew me off because I was expecting customer service.\u201d She was served, but her coffee tasted stale and bitter, she said.The two women went to the Starbucks on Astor Place in December for \u201cDeaf Chat Coffee,\u201d a monthly networking event that brings together the deaf and those learning sign language. Members of the group said that Starbucks workers refused to take some of their orders at these meetings, stared when they signed to each other, complained that they were not buying enough coffee and pastries, and eventually told the group not to come back.Now these customers are suing Starbucks, charging that the Seattle-based coffee chain known for calling its employees \u201cpartners\u201d and supporting fair-trade coffee has discriminated against the deaf at two of its Manhattan stores. \u201cThey seemed very uncomfortable with deaf patrons,\u201d said Ms. Bitkower, 66, a retired beautician, through a sign-language interpreter. \u201cThey definitely had a bad attitude. They were very dismissive. And we noticed the hearing patrons were allowed to sit there and do what they wanted.\u201dThe legal battle has jolted many New Yorkers who have made the ubiquitous coffee shops part of their routine, and served as a reminder that even in a city as tolerant as New York, intolerance can be all too common for some populations. Census data shows that there are 170,928 people with hearing difficulties in New York City, about 2.1 percent of the population, though some advocates suggest that those numbers are too low.Jaime Riley, a spokeswoman for Starbucks, confirmed that company officials were investigating the complaints, saying they \u201cdo not agree with the allegations contained in the complaint nor the manner in which the company has been unjustly characterized in this lawsuit.\u201dWhile accommodations for the deaf are commonplace, and include sign-language interpreters at Broadway shows and mayoral conferences, advocates for the deaf say that discrimination occurs on a daily basis. \u201cToo often, it is the actions of one employee or one manager in a store or restaurant or other place of business that causes a deaf or hard of hearing customer to feel unwelcome or mistreated,\u201d Howard A. Rosenblum, chief executive officer of the National Association of the Deaf, said in a statement.ImageThe Starbucks at the intersection of Astor Place and Lafayette Street is one of the locations named in the lawsuit.Credit...Nicole Bengiveno/The New York TimesThough the city\u2019s Commission on Human Rights has received only nine complaints involving discrimination against the deaf or hard of hearing since 2008, these incidents illustrate the kind of unpleasantness they can face. In two cases, for instance, patients said that a doctor\u2019s office and a Queens medical center both failed to provide sign-language interpreters when requested. Norman Siegel, a civil rights lawyer, said that discrimination against the deaf often goes overlooked because it is subtle and sophisticated, and because some deaf people may be isolated and may not speak up when it happens to them. \u201cIt\u2019s not like putting up a sign on the door \u2018No deaf people allowed,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cBut when deaf people are treated differently than others, it does hurt and it\u2019s illegal.\u201dThe lawsuit against Starbucks, filed last month in federal court in Manhattan, seeks to compel the company to conduct sensitivity training for employees and adopt policies to better serve deaf customers, said Eric Baum, a lawyer who represents the plaintiffs. Ms. Riley declined to discuss the specific litigation, but said that the company \u201cbelieves the facts will demonstrate clearly that Starbucks did not discriminate.\u201d An assistant manager at the Starbucks on Astor Place said the staff could not comment on the case.Ms. Riley said that Starbucks already provided sensitivity training to its work force of more than 200,000, and embraced \u201cequality, inclusion, and accessibility\u201d for all employees and customers. After the lawsuit was filed, Starbucks published a post on its Web site, noting other efforts including hiring deaf employees, sponsoring sign-language events at stores, and providing workers with an opportunity to learn sign language and take an in-house course called \u201cCreating a Deaf Friendly Environment.\u201dStill, Alan Roth said he \u201cwas flabbergasted\u201d at the reception he received at his neighborhood Starbucks at 424 Park Avenue South. He said he ordered a latte last August from a woman who told him, \u201cYou talk funny.\u201d When he responded maybe that was because he was deaf, he said the worker started laughing at him.\u201cI was embarrassed and annoyed,\u201d said Mr. Roth, 45, who owns a sign-language school in Manhattan. \u201cI mean this is New York City with a lot of people with international accents so why is she saying I talk funny?\u201dMr. Roth said that he complained to a manager, who he said defended that worker. When Mr. Roth contacted Starbucks\u2019s corporate office, he was offered an apology and a Starbucks gift card. \u201cI never got the gift card but I could care less,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want another deaf person to feel what I felt. It was plain discrimination.\u201dDeaf customers gathered at the Astor Place store for Deaf Chat Coffee on the first Thursday night of every month; similar groups have been organized at coffeehouses, including Starbucks, around the country. As many as 60 people came in October, though they were not all there at the same time. Later events drew half that number.Ms. Ng, 53, who frequents other Starbucks stores, said that she had never been refused service until she tried to order at the Astor Place location. \u201cI was shooed away,\u201d said Ms. Ng, through a sign interpreter. \u201cI wondered if they were having a bad day, but that\u2019s their business. I just wanted a drink.\u201dOther deaf customers said that they were told their group was taking up too much room, and not buying enough coffee and pastries.They said that Starbucks workers asked them not to come back. When they did in March, they said, the store summoned police officers to try to eject them. Guy Wegener, who is not deaf and joined the group to practice sign language, recalled that they held up their coffee cups and pastries to show the officers that they were paying customers. The police left, he said, but it \u201cfelt like we were being singled out.\u201dAfter that, most of the deaf customers stopped going to the monthly meetings because they said no one felt much like getting coffee there anymore."}, {"url": "https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/on-abc-family-an-episode-in-sign-language/", "headline": "On ABC Family, an Episode in Sign Language", "date": "2013-03-06T21:00:58+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\n                                    On Monday night, ABC Family did something that no commercial television outlet in the United States had ever done: it broadcast an entire episode of a show in sign language, with closed captioning turned on by default.\n                                    Advocates for the deaf and hard-of-hearing cheered the move, and they wondered: would viewers tune in specifically for the almost-silent episode of the series, \u201cSwitched at Birth,\u201d one of ABC Family\u2019s\n                                        most popular?

Perhaps this is because the best scientists today are not directly responsible for the very weapons that threaten our safety, and are therefore no longer the high priests of destruction, to be consulted as oracles as they were after World War II.The problems scientists confront today are actually much harder than they were at the dawn of the nuclear age, and their successes more heartily earned. This is why it is so distressing that even Stephen Hawking, perhaps the world\u2019s most famous living scientist, gets more attention for his views on space aliens than his views on nuclear weapons.Scientists\u2019 voices are crucial in the debates over the global challenges of climate change, nuclear proliferation and the potential creation of new and deadly pathogens. But unlike in the past, their voices aren\u2019t being heard.Indeed, it was Albert Einstein\u2019s letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939, warning of the possibility that Hitler might develop a nuclear weapon, that quickly prompted the start of the Manhattan Project, the largest scientific wartime project in history. Then, in 1945, the same group of physicists who had created the atomic bomb founded the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to warn of the dangers of nuclear weapons, and to promote international cooperation to avoid nuclear war. As Einstein said in May 1946, \u201cThe unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking, and thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.\u201d The men who built the bomb had enormous prestige as the greatest physics minds of the time. They included Nobel laureates, past and future, like Hans A. Bethe, Richard P. Feynman, Enrico Fermi, Ernest O. Lawrence and Isidor Isaac Rabi. In June 1946, for instance, J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had helped lead the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, N.M., argued that atomic energy should be placed under civilian rather than military control. Within two months President Harry S. Truman signed a law doing so, effective January 1947. Today, nine nuclear states have stockpiled perhaps 20,000 nuclear weapons, many of which dwarf the weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yet proliferation is as alarming as ever, even though President Obama signed, and Congress ratified, the new strategic arms-reduction treaty in 2010. Iran\u2019s nuclear program could lead to conflict. So could the animosity between India and Pakistan, which both have nuclear weapons.ImageCredit...Yarek WaszulThe United States is complicit, because whatever our leaders may say, our actions suggest that we have no real intention to disarm. The United Nations adopted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would ban countries from testing nuclear weapons, in 1996. But it has not come into force; the Senate rejected ratification in 1999, and while President Obama has promised to obtain ratification, he has not shown enough urgency in doing so. What\u2019s striking is that today\u2019s version of the Manhattan Project scientists \u2014 not the weapons researchers at our maximum-security national laboratories, but distinguished scientific minds at our research universities and other national labs \u2014 provide advice that is routinely ignored. Last year, the National Academy of Sciences published a report demonstrating that all the technical preconditions necessary for ratifying the United Nations treaty were in place. But this vital issue did not come up in the presidential campaign and is barely mentioned in Washington. Another study by the academy last year, on flaws in America\u2019s costly ballistic missile defense program, has had little impact even as the Pentagon considers cuts in military spending. I am co-chairman of the board of sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which has supported the call for a world free of nuclear weapons \u2014 a vision backed by major foreign policy figures in both parties. But ideological biases have become so ingrained in Washington that scientific realities are subordinated to political intransigence.Do scientists need to develop new doomsday tools before our views are again heard? Will climate researchers remain voiceless unless they propose untested geoengineering technologies that could have insidious consequences? Will biologists be heard only if their work spawns new biotechnologies that could be weaponized?Because the threat of nuclear proliferation is not being addressed, because missile defense technologies remain flawed and because new threats exposed by scientists have been ignored, the Bulletin\u2019s annual Doomsday clock \u2014 which was updated on Tuesday \u2014 still sits at five minutes to midnight. The clock is meant to convey the threats we face not only from nuclear weapons, but also from climate change and the potential unintended consequences of genetic engineering, which could be misused by those seeking to create bioweapons.Until science and data become central to informing our public policies, our civilization will be hamstrung in confronting the gravest threats to its survival."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/nyregion/technology-makes-life-a-little-easier-for-homeless-and-deaf-ethiopian-immigrant.html", "headline": "For a Homeless Deaf Man, an iPad Makes Life Easier", "date": "2013-01-11T02:40:57+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Some of the problems Abreham Zemedagegehu faces as a homeless person in New York, like cold weather and lack of sleep, are fairly predictable. Some are less so: the police have gotten angry with Mr. Zemedagegehu because they did not realize that he could not hear their instructions. He was born with no hearing in one ear and only a little in the other.And then there are the passers-by who see the face of God in his.\u201cThey say I look like Jesus,\u201d said Mr. Zemedagegehu, 39, of the strangers who often take his picture, capturing an image of a tall man with straight, dark hair hanging down beyond his long face, strikingly covered by a full beard and mustache. \u201cThey should ask me permission first.\u201dThe comparison is especially unnerving, even frightening, for a man as devout as Mr. Zemedagegehu. Far from his family in Ethiopia and his friends in Washington, where he lived before moving to New York City a few years ago, Mr. Zemedagegehu finds companionship in God.His sanctuary is as mobile as he is: he wears a large cross typical of his Ethiopian Orthodox faith underneath his donated North Face gear and prays over bottled water to make it holy before drinking it.\u201cThe bravest thing I can do in the city is pray and read my Bible a lot,\u201d Mr. Zemedagegehu said.But for more earthly communication, like talking to his doctor, consulting with social-service providers or being interviewed by a newspaper reporter, Mr. Zemedagegehu is aided by an American Sign Language interpreter. Technology has made this process relatively simple: he uses a Web camera to sign with an interpreter, who talks on the phone with his hearing conversation partner.To make these calls easier, the Community Service Society, one of the organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, drew $1,308 from the fund to buy Mr. Zemedagegehu an iPad and accessories last month. The money was also used to buy him some warm clothing. Now he can send e-mail and have video chats in a Starbucks, the library or anywhere with Wi-Fi.Mr. Zemedagegehu said the iPad, which he repacks carefully in its original box whenever he is done using it, has helped him avoid \u201ca lot more headaches.\u201dHe said he came to the United States in 2001 thanks to an immigration lottery, and is now an American citizen. After a brief period in Minnesota, he moved to the Washington area, a nexus of the Ethiopian community in the United States.It is also the home of Gallaudet University, the renowned school for the deaf, where Mr. Zemedagegehu took language courses. In Washington, he said, he had a home and a job \u2014 until he lost both after a back injury from lifting packages at FedEx about four years ago.Mr. Zemedagegehu said New York City was so expensive that he could not afford an apartment on his $805 a month in disability benefits, so he was \u201cnot real crazy about New York in general.\u201d He usually sleeps in the street, riding out some recent storms in a Midtown restaurant. Legal Aid in Washington connected him with Community Service Society in September so it could help him communicate with government agencies about his health benefits, but Mr. Zemedagegehu has also started going to the organization\u2019s Manhattan office for warmth and conversation.Despite his struggles in the United States, he said, \u201cthe opportunity for a deaf individual is far better here than in Ethiopia. You can drive here, the interpreting service is far better here, the job opportunities for the deaf.\u201dHe is working with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to find an apartment while waiting to receive job training from the state\u2019s vocational rehabilitation program. There are few options that require little verbal communication and minimal physical labor, but Mr. Zemedagegehu has some ideas: maybe something at the post office, or as a meter reader for gas and electric utilities.After he gets a job and an apartment, Mr. Zemedagegehu wants to fly home for a visit and share his story in church.\u201cI had a good experience because I\u2019ve been homeless,\u201d he said. He has studied how people treat him compared with the wealthy, and he imagines his sermon would ask, \u201cIf suddenly you had a disaster, how would you have it?\u201d His faith teaches him that the greatest among us might live modestly. \u201cJesus even slept on the streets,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/world/americas/deaf-officers-keep-watch-over-crime-in-oaxaca.html", "headline": "Deaf Officers Step in Where Police Work Counts on Eyes More Than Ears", "date": "2012-12-19T03:17:34+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "OAXACA, Mexico \u2014 When the police officer spotted the man acting suspiciously, pacing erratically with an odd look on his face, he immediately called for backup. That is, he spun around in his chair at the police command center here and rapidly motioned to a colleague in sign language.The officer, Gerardo, 32, is part of a cadre of 20 deaf officers formed several months ago to help keep an eye on this tourist hub. The suspicious man that he spotted on a security camera turned out to be a prime suspect in a murder. \u201cEven though we can\u2019t hear, we can undertake any role,\u201d Gerardo said, speaking through an interpreter. More than 200 cameras watch over this city, one of several in Mexico that have installed such security systems in recent years to fight street crime.While raising some privacy concerns, the systems are celebrated by police officials for giving officers an extra tool to reduce response times and document crimes.Officials here concede that getting units quickly to the scene is only part of the struggle. Crime victims often decide not to file complaints, lacking faith in the justice system.Visitors to this colonial city, famed for its art and food, seem reassured by the cameras as well as by accompanying signs warning that the area is under surveillance.Though Oaxaca is not known for high crime, tourists can be targets for purse-snatchers and pickpockets, and the more working-class neighborhoods have their share of drug dealing, auto thefts, fights and violent crime.The state refurbished its police command center this year, but found it needed extra help monitoring the 230 cameras, a time-consuming, monotonous task. There was another problem: because the images lack sound, officers had trouble determining what people were saying.\u201cWe could not read lips, so it occurred to us to use deaf people since many of them can,\u201d said Ignacio Villalobos, the public safety under secretary here.He said their heightened visual attention had enabled the deaf officers to see trouble developing on the screens faster than other officers who can hear and speak but are frequently distracted by the buzzing of phones, police scanners and chatter in the command center.Mr. Villalobos said the deaf officers \u2014 \u201cour silent angels,\u201d he called them \u2014 had helped solve or assisted in several cases, though he declined to provide specific data, pending a future evaluation of the program. He called the murder case, from last summer, the biggest success.ImageCredit...The New York TimesThe officers received training in police procedures but are not sworn patrol officers and do not carry weapons. Their job is limited to the command center, but supervisors did not want their last names published, given their involvement in crime reporting.Few of them had gainful employment before they became crime fighters. The disabled in Mexico have high rates of unemployment and often get by on the support of family and friends.But the private sector and some foundations are working to reverse that. Among the more visible programs is one at the international airport in Mexico City, where people in wheelchairs work checking identification at security lines and answering questions from visitors.A recent morning showed the monotony that often characterizes police work, as several deaf officers fixed their gazes on screens displaying the routine nature of city life.\u201cLooks like a fight there,\u201d one officer said excitedly, as dispatchers grabbed radios to send units. But other officers quickly determined it was just a bunch of children roughhousing.Another officer spotted a couple opening what appeared to be beers in their parked car along the side of a road. A patrol unit was sent over, but the couple were allowed to go with a warning, after they poured out the contents of the bottles.At first, veteran officers chuckled at the newcomers\u2019 wide-eyed reactions to routine car accidents and purse-snatchings, but over time the novice officers are developing a harder shell.\u201cWe have dehumanized them a little, and they have humanized us,\u201d Mr. Villalobos said with a laugh.The officers, mainly recruited from social service organizations, said that after their struggles to find work, law enforcement had been rewarding.One new officer, Eunice, 26, said she had been rejected for jobs at offices and stores, with few managers willing to take a chance or tailor positions to her deafness.But she has found her niche as an officer. One recent night, she said, the image of someone getting hit by a car flashed across her screen, at first shocking her. But she quickly composed herself and alerted the dispatcher. With a prideful smile, she said simply, \u201cWe are the eyes for them.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/science/sign-language-researchers-broaden-science-lexicon.html", "headline": "Pushing Science\u2019s Limits in Sign Language Lexicon", "date": "2012-12-03T21:59:10+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Imagine trying to learn biology without ever using the word \u201corganism.\u201d Or studying to become a botanist when the only way of referring to photosynthesis is to spell the word out, letter by painstaking letter.For deaf students, this game of scientific Password has long been the daily classroom and laboratory experience. Words like \u201corganism\u201d and \u201cphotosynthesis\u201d \u2014 to say nothing of more obscure and harder-to-spell terms \u2014 have no single widely accepted equivalent in sign language. This means that deaf students and their teachers and interpreters must improvise, making it that much harder for the students to excel in science and pursue careers in it.\u201cOften times, it would involve a lot of finger-spelling and a lot of improvisation,\u201d said Matthew Schwerin, a physicist with the Food and Drug Administration who is deaf, of his years in school. \u201cFor the majority of scientific terms,\u201d Mr. Schwerin and his interpreter for the day would \u201ctry to find a correct sign for the term, and if nothing was pre-existing, we would come up with a sign that was agreeable with both parties.\u201dNow thanks to the Internet \u2014 particularly the boom in online video \u2014 resources for deaf students seeking science-related signs are easier to find and share. Crowdsourcing projects in both American Sign Language and British Sign Language are under way at several universities, enabling people who are deaf to coalesce around signs for commonly used terms.This year, one of those resources, the Scottish Sensory Centre\u2019s British Sign Language Glossary Project, added 116 new signs for physics and engineering terms, including signs for \u201clight-year,\u201d\u00a0 (hold one hand up and spread the fingers downward for \u201clight,\u201d then bring both hands together in front of your chest and slowly move them apart for \u201cyear\u201d), \u201cmass\u201d and \u201cX-ray\u201d (form an X with your index fingers, then, with the index finger on the right hand, point outward).\u00a0The signs were developed by a team of researchers at the center, a division of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland that develops learning tools for students with visual and auditory impairments. The researchers spent more than a year soliciting ideas from deaf science workers, circulating lists of potential signs and ultimately gathering for \u201can intense weekend\u201d of final voting, said Audrey Cameron, science adviser for the project. (Dr. Cameron is also deaf, and like all non-hearing people interviewed for this article, answered questions via e-mail.)Whether the Scottish Sensory Centre\u2019s signs will take hold among its audience remains to be seen. \u201cSome will be adopted, and some will probably never be accepted,\u201d Dr. Cameron said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens.\u201dIdeally, the standardization of signs will make it easier for deaf students to keep pace with their hearing classmates during lectures. \u201cI can only choose to look at one thing at a time,\u201d said Mr. Schwerin of the F.D.A., recalling his science education, \u201cand it often meant choosing between the interpreter, the blackboard/screen/material, or taking notes. It was like, pick one, and lose out on the others.\u201dThe problem doesn\u2019t end at graduation. In fact, it only intensifies as new discoveries add unfamiliar terms to the scientific lexicon. \u201cI\u2019ve had numerous meetings where I couldn\u2019t participate properly because the interpreters were not able to understand the jargon and they did not know any scientific signs,\u201d Dr. Cameron said.One general complaint about efforts to standardize signs for technical terms is the idea that, much like spoken language, sign language should be allowed to develop organically rather than be dictated from above.\u201cSigns that are developed naturally \u2014 i.e., that are tested and refined in everyday conversation \u2014 are more likely to be accepted quickly by the community,\u201d said Derek Braun, director of the molecular genetics laboratory at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., which he said was the first biological laboratory designed and administered by deaf scientists.Since at least the 1970s, deaf scientists have tried to address the lack of uniformity by gathering common signs for scientific terms in printed manuals and on videotapes. The problem has always been getting deaf students and their interpreters to adopt them.Often, at science conferences, \u201clocal interpreters that we never met before would often use different signs for the same terms, leading to confusion,\u201d said Caroline Solomon, a biology professor at Gallaudet University who is deaf.Gallaudet has tried to take a democratic approach to the problem: it collaborates on the ASL-STEM Forum, a wiki-style Web site dedicated to \u201cenabling American Sign Language to grow in science, technology, engineering and mathematics\u201d that was set up in 2009 by researchers at the University of Washington. Anyone can submit, critique and vote for science signs, which are demonstrated in short videos. The idea is to let those who are hearing-impaired and learning science decide which new signs should become standard.So far the crowdsourcing approach seems to be effective, at least at Gallaudet. While \u201cmany of the signs posted on the ASL-STEM Forum are by Gallaudet students and faculty,\u201d Dr. Solomon said, and therefore are already in use on campus, there have been other signs \u201cposted by non-Gallaudet users that we like better and have started to use ourselves.\u201dMaking sciences more accessible to the deaf is a priority not just to those with hearing problems, but also to science educators in general. As they look to ease a worldwide shortage of STEM teachers, groups like the Institute of Physics, a global scientific society based in London, are financing projects that make it easier for people with disabilities to enter careers in science.\u201cWe not only want to provide support, we want to raise aspirations, to say to people, \u2018you can do this,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Peter Main, director of education and science at the institute, which helped finance the Scottish sign language project.Surprisingly, some deaf students say that relying on sign language gives them an advantage over hearing students. Because it is acted out, with everything from facial expressions to speed of motion available as tools to convey meaning, and because it is in many ways less codified than written language, sign language can illustrate difficult scientific principles better than traditional languages can.\u201cThere\u2019s often a lot of confusion in early years of physics between mass and weight\u201d for hearing students, because the two concepts are so similar, said Mr. Main, who is not deaf. But because mass has no universally accepted sign, interpreters are free to create hand motions that illustrate its meaning specifically in opposition to weight.For example: \u201cIf I wanted to indicate mass, I would probably hold up a balled fist,\u201d said Kate Lacey, an interpreter at George Washington University who often works with science students. \u201cThen, to indicate weight, I\u2019d drop that fist toward the floor.\u201d The implication is that weight represents gravity\u2019s effect on mass, which is about as clear a definition as one is likely to find.Such elegant personifications of tricky scientific concepts leave some deaf students feeling sorry for those who rely on their ears. \u201cOne of my students was telling me recently that she can\u2019t imagine the difficulty that hearing instructors must have in describing concepts through spoken English, because of the linearity of spoken language,\u201d Dr. Braun said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/the-bush-white-house-was-deaf-to-9-11-warnings.html", "headline": "The Deafness Before the Storm", "date": "2012-09-11T01:00:24+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "IT was perhaps the most famous presidential briefing in history. On Aug. 6, 2001, President George W. Bush received a classified review of the threats posed by Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda. That morning\u2019s \u201cpresidential daily brief\u201d \u2014 the top-secret document prepared by America\u2019s intelligence agencies \u2014 featured the now-infamous heading: \u201cBin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\u201d A few weeks later, on 9/11, Al Qaeda accomplished that goal.On April 10, 2004, the Bush White House declassified that daily brief \u2014 and only that daily brief   \u2014 in response to pressure from the 9/11 Commission, which was investigating the events leading to the attack. Administration officials dismissed the document\u2019s significance, saying that, despite the jaw-dropping headline, it was only an assessment of Al Qaeda\u2019s history, not a warning of the impending attack. While some critics considered that claim absurd, a close reading of the brief showed that the argument had some validity.That is, unless it was read in conjunction with the daily briefs preceding Aug. 6, the ones the Bush administration would not release. While those documents are still not public, I have read excerpts from many of them, along with other recently declassified records, and come to an inescapable conclusion: the administration\u2019s reaction to what Mr. Bush was told in the weeks before that infamous briefing reflected significantly more negligence than has been disclosed. In other words, the Aug. 6 document, for all of the controversy it provoked, is not nearly as shocking as the briefs that came before it. The direct warnings to Mr. Bush about the possibility of a Qaeda attack began in the spring of 2001. By May 1,    the Central Intelligence Agency told the White House of a report that \u201ca group presently in the United States\u201d was planning a terrorist operation. Weeks later, on June 22, the daily brief reported that Qaeda strikes could be \u201cimminent,\u201d although intelligence suggested the time frame was flexible.   But some in the administration considered the warning to be just bluster. An intelligence official and a member of the Bush administration both told me in interviews that the neoconservative leaders who had recently assumed power at the Pentagon were warning the White House that the C.I.A. had been fooled; according to this theory, Bin Laden was merely pretending to be planning an attack to distract the administration from Saddam Hussein, whom the neoconservatives saw as a greater threat.   Intelligence officials, these sources said, protested that the idea of Bin Laden, an Islamic fundamentalist, conspiring with Mr. Hussein, an Iraqi secularist, was ridiculous, but the neoconservatives\u2019 suspicions were nevertheless carrying the day.In response, the C.I.A. prepared an analysis that all but pleaded with the White House to accept that the danger from Bin Laden was real. ImageCredit...Javier Ja\u00e9n Benavides\u201cThe U.S. is not the target of a disinformation campaign by Usama Bin Laden,\u201d the daily brief of June 29 read, using the government\u2019s transliteration of Bin Laden\u2019s first name. Going on for more than a page, the document recited much of the evidence, including an interview that month with a Middle Eastern journalist in which Bin Laden aides warned of a coming attack, as well as competitive pressures that the terrorist leader was feeling, given the number of Islamists being recruited for the separatist Russian region of Chechnya.And the C.I.A. repeated the warnings in the briefs that followed. Operatives connected to Bin Laden, one reported on June 29, expected the planned near-term attacks to have \u201cdramatic consequences,\u201d including major casualties. On July 1, the brief stated that the operation had been delayed, but \u201cwill occur soon.\u201d Some of the briefs again reminded Mr. Bush that the attack timing was flexible, and that, despite any perceived delay, the planned assault was on track.Yet, the White House failed to take significant action. Officials at the Counterterrorism Center of the C.I.A. grew apoplectic. On July 9, at a meeting of the counterterrorism group, one official suggested that the staff put in for a transfer so that somebody else would be responsible when the attack took place, two people who were there told me in interviews. The suggestion was batted down, they said, because there would be no time to train anyone else. That same day in Chechnya, according to intelligence I reviewed, Ibn Al-Khattab, an extremist who was known for his brutality and his links to Al Qaeda, told his followers that there would soon be very big news. Within 48 hours, an intelligence official told me, that information was conveyed to the White House, providing more data supporting the C.I.A.\u2019s warnings. Still, the alarm bells didn\u2019t sound.On July 24, Mr. Bush was notified that the attack was still being readied, but that it had been postponed, perhaps by a few months. But the president did not feel the briefings on potential attacks were sufficient, one intelligence official told me, and instead asked for a broader analysis on Al Qaeda, its aspirations and its history. In response, the C.I.A. set to work on the Aug. 6 brief.In the aftermath of 9/11, Bush officials attempted to deflect criticism that they had ignored C.I.A. warnings by saying they had not been told when and where the attack would occur. That is true, as far as it goes, but it misses the point. Throughout that summer, there were events that might have exposed the plans, had the government been on high alert. Indeed, even as the Aug. 6 brief was being prepared, Mohamed al-Kahtani, a Saudi believed to have been assigned a role in the 9/11 attacks, was stopped at an airport in Orlando, Fla., by a suspicious customs agent and sent back overseas on Aug. 4. Two weeks later, another co-conspirator, Zacarias Moussaoui, was arrested on immigration charges in Minnesota after arousing suspicions at a flight school. But the dots were not connected, and Washington did not react. Could the 9/11 attack have been stopped, had the Bush team reacted with urgency to the warnings contained in all of those daily briefs? We can\u2019t ever know. And that may be the most agonizing reality of all.

I am the mother of two daughters, both diagnosed deaf within their first weeks of life. My husband and I, both hearing, faced complicated decisions from the very start. Our babies\n                                        needed exposure to language immediately (unlike hearing babies, they heard nothing in the womb), and we needed to make choices.\n                                    Most parents simply whisper and coo to their children in their native tongues. We had to decide \u2014 and quickly \u2014 what our daughters\u2019 native tongue would be. Should we try to get our daughters access\n                                        to spoken language through hearing technology, or to immerse them (and ourselves) in American Sign Language, or to try to do both?\n                                    We chose spoken language, primarily. We believed it would give our girls the greatest opportunities over the course of their lifetimes \u2014 and, maybe even more powerfully, we felt it would be best for us as a family.\n                                         We were new parents, bonding with our babies, and we, like parents everywhere, wanted to do that in our own mother tongue.\n                                    Hearing technologies \u2014 in the form of digital hearing aids and cochlear implants \u2014 have come so far\n                                        as to make this a viable option even for our younger daughter, who was born profoundly deaf. Many people we meet \u2014 hearing and deaf \u2014 understand the decisions we made to enable our children to hear\n                                        and to speak our language. Many \u2014 but not all.\n                                    I\u2019ve met people who believe that despite the fact that we gave birth to them, our children are deaf and should belong to the signing Deaf community (in the distinct culture and community of those with fluency\n                                        in sign language, \u201cDeaf\u201d is always capitalized) \u2014 and neither spoken language nor the culture of hearing serves them. One woman expressed \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d for us because (in her view)\n                                        we failed to accept our children for who they are. We sought to change them into hearing people, wrongly imposing our world on them. (Most parents, it should be said, impose their world on their children without\n                                        compunction.)\n                                    \n                                    More than 90 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents. Given the major advances in hearing technology in recent years, many of those children can gain very good access to the particular spoken language of\n                                        their parents. They and their parents, through everyday communication, can connect with one another and share their family\u2019s history, heritage and culture \u2014 just as other families do around the globe.\n                                    But this technological opportunity is relatively new, and a long and troubled history of deafness still reverberates with pain and anger. The older deaf remember a time when parents insisted on an oral approach for\n                                        their deaf children without the benefit of today\u2019s technologies, and many of those children suffered as a result. Of the parents who sent their children to signing schools, the majority never themselves learned\n                                        more than preschool-level sign language, so that \u201chome\u201d was, for many of these children, isolating and alien.\n                                    With little connection to their hearing, speaking families back then, many deaf children found acceptance and camaraderie in communities with deaf people who signed. Today, a blanket insistence on Deaf language and\n                                        culture for deaf children who can acquire the language of their families is outdated. Family bonds, forged through rich communication and the intimacy this communication brings, can be far more formative to identity\n                                        than the fact of a child\u2019s deafness.\n                                    Some will counter that the hearing families of deaf children should work harder to learn sign language. Perhaps they should, if only to share experiences with the deaf who do not or cannot use hearing technology. But\n                                        the demands of fluency are out of reach for many parents (not to mention grandparents, siblings and family friends), and as a second language, it may prove inadequate for intimacy and community. Try to communicate\n                                        with your newborn in Greek while raising your other kids and keeping your job, and the challenge will become clear.\n                                    Both of our daughters were fitted with hearing aids within weeks of birth, and our younger daughter eventually got two cochlear implants. We also learned some sign language, which we use when their technology is off.\n                                        Both have learned to speak beautifully. They happily attend mainstream schools and feel a strong sense of membership in our family and our community.

(You can watch a clip from the series in the video player above.)\n                                    In spite of the school\u2019s unique mission, those involved say that the series, which is set to premiere on Oct. 24, will deliver drama characteristic of MTV programming and college life, with footage of class lectures\n                                        and keg parties alike.\n                                    \u201cStudents here are just like students anywhere else,\u201d said Catherine Murphy, a spokeswoman for the university. \u201cThey\u2019re typical undergraduates.\u201d\n                                    Paul Ricci, executive producer of mtvU and creator of the series, said that \u201cQuiet Campus\u201d was inspired by his desire to illustrate the universality of the college experience.\n                                    Six years ago, Mr. Ricci took cameras on spring break with two dozen deaf college students to capture their vacation in one short episode. Since then, he said, he had wanted to expand on that piece and follow deaf students\n                                        in their everyday lives. While his proposal was initially met with skepticism by Gallaudet and its students, mtvU ultimately won its participants over with its emphasis on the normalcy of living life with a hearing\n                                        impairment.\n                                    \n                                    \u201cOur goal was to get into the school culture and see it through these kids\u2019 eyes,\u201d Mr. Ricci said. \u201cBy the end, we want viewers to almost forget these students are deaf.\u201d\n                                    To do so, the show chose to focus on common collegiate themes: competition in the classroom and the sports arena; relationships and sexuality; independent living away from home.\n                                    The show\u2019s principal characters include a gay Latino student, a charismatic football player and a young woman who lost her hearing in chemotherapy treatment. There is also a young man trying to, as mtvU puts\n                                        it, \u201cfind his way out of the friend zone,\u201d and perhaps kindle a romantic spark with the aforementioned cancer survivor.\n                                    Three of the featured students were interviewed via e-mail by The Choice, calling the experience of having a camera trained on them \u201cweird\u201d \u2014 in the words of one \u2014 but worth it.\n                                    \u201cIt\u2019s important that the audience can finally realize that we can relate to the same lifestyle as them,\u201d wrote Clayton Lawson, who is now a junior at Gallaudet. \u201cJust because we\u2019re\n                                        deaf doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a social life or go through normal, everyday problems.\u201d\n                                    With a fused focus on the college experience and the hearing impaired, the show will echo two past MTV series: \u201cCollege Life,\u201d which featured undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,\n                                        and \u201cTrue Life: I\u2019m Deaf,\u201d which followed, among others, a young, hard-of-hearing woman who studied at Towson University in Maryland.\n                                    \u201cQuiet Campus,\u201d which will include voiceovers and subtitles, will likely resonate with fans of \u201cSwitched at Birth,\u201d the popular ABC Family series \u2014 launched in June to record-breaking ratings                                        \u2014 which follows the fictional lives of two high school girls, one of them deaf and debating enrolling in a hearing school.\n                                    The show will also provide a window into the world of higher education for the deaf, allowing prospective students \u2014 hearing-impaired or not \u2014 to experience campus reality without an in-person visit.\n                                    While \u201cQuiet Campus\u201d will feature deaf students exclusively, Gallaudet, which had an acceptance rate of 75 percent in 2009, enrolls both deaf and hearing undergraduates in its annual class of about 300.\n                                        Hearing students must have some proficiency in American Sign Language and are limited to 5 percent of the student population unless majoring in interpretation, Ms. Murphy said. They are required to complete a\n                                        different application for admission along with an in-person interview, not required for deaf students.\n                                    Gallaudet\u2019s admissions are rolling, and while the school draws students from around the world, according to Ms. Murphy, there are three feeder high schools from which a large number of Gallaudet undergraduates\n                                        matriculate: Maryland School for the Deaf, California School for the Deaf (both its Fremont and Riverside locations)\n                                        and Gallaudet\u2019s own high school in Washington.\n                                    \u201cQuiet Campus\u201d will premiere at Gallaudet on Wednesday, and its first episode will air on mtvU on Oct. 24 at 12 p.m. New episodes will continue for four weeks thereafter.\n                                    \u201cI really hope this show will not only change people\u2019s close-minded perspectives of Gallaudet,\u201d Mr. Lawson, one of the students in the series, concluded, \u201cbut that it also puts the school\n                                        on the map.\u201d\n                                    What do readers of The Choice think of the premise of \u201cQuiet Campus\u201d?

But the crowd that gathered last month was a bit different from the usual shouting protesters. Scores of deaf and hard-of-hearing children and their families assembled to complain in American Sign Language. Parents also have confronted new board members of the state\u2019s school for the deaf in pointed, awkward exchanges. And more objections are expected when the board convenes next month for what had, until now, been ordinary meetings on routine school matters.At the root of the tension is a debate that stretches well beyond Indiana: Will sign language and the nation\u2019s separate schools for the deaf be abandoned as more of the deaf turn to communicating, with help from fast-evolving technology, through amplified sounds and speech? And in the struggle to balance depleted budgets, Indiana and other states, like Kansas, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota and West Virginia have called for cuts on many fronts in recent years, including for state schools for the deaf \u2014 a group of institutions with long, rich traditions. Some advocates for the schools now worry that financial concerns could push the debate toward sending deaf children to \u201cmainstream\u201d schools, which would, in the eyes of some, ultimately encourage methods of communication other than American Sign Language, or A.S.L. \u201cSpeaking and listening classrooms across the nation are known for their forced exclusion of A.S.L. and expressly forbid any contact with the culturally deaf adult role models,\u201d Marvin Miller, president of the Indiana Association of the Deaf, who is deaf, said in an e-mail interview. \u201cWe view this as inflicting violence upon thousands of innocent deaf and hard-of-hearing babies \u2014 taking away their language and pinning their hopes on dismal success rates of cochlear implants,\u201d he added.The two approaches \u2014 sign language and the so-called listening and spoken language approach \u2014 are both in wide use.\u00a0Many people do not see them in conflict with one another, and view the two approaches simply as a matter of personal choice.\u00a0 But shrinking state budgets, with less money to be spent on programs for the deaf, are hardening the debate because they are turning preferences into policy decisions. Advocates for those who use technology to\u00a0hear and speak say their option can be one answer to the budget constraints.\u201cKids in the mainstream save society, taxpayers, a significant amount of money in the short-term and in the long-term when it comes to being integrated into the hearing world,\u201d said Naomi S. Horton, executive director of Hear Indiana, which supports families who use listening and spoken language to communicate. \u201cThere is a financial benefit, but at the end of the day it has to be a parent\u2019s choice,\u201d Ms. Horton said.Here, the clash began this spring, when Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican, filled four empty slots on the board of the Indiana School for the Deaf, which was founded more than 165 years ago and promotes what it calls a bilingual, bicultural philosophy that includes American Sign Language and English. Some 340 students go to the school, which provides outreach services to hundreds of others.Parents complained that three of the appointees were not themselves deaf. Two of the new board members (both of whom have a deaf or hard-of-hearing child) drew particular anger because families said they were dues-paying members of Hear Indiana and were perceived to favor an educational approach of amplifying sound and encouraging speech over sign language. ImageKim Bianco Majeri says the Indiana School for the Deaf is a nurturing environment for Caroline, 4, left, and Gabrielle, 5.Credit...Peter W. Stevenson for The New York TimesThe appointments, they said, signaled that the state was now picking sides \u2014 against American Sign Language and deaf culture.\u201cIt has become crystal clear that these selections were premeditated, planned and executed in a style befitting the most savvy of politics,\u201d said Kim Bianco Majeri, who is deaf and whose daughters \u2014 one deaf and one hard of hearing \u2014 attend the Indiana School for the Deaf.Ms. Majeri said the school provided them with language skills of all sorts but also the nurturing environment and true peers that she said she missed out on. \u201cMy husband and I grew up mainstreamed and we would never wish that on our children,\u201d she said.Two of the board members who have faced criticism did not respond to requests for comment. A third, Mary Susan Buhner, whose husband serves on the board of Hear Indiana, declined to respond to specific questions about her views, but she did say she believes in the\u00a0stated mission of the Indiana School for the Deaf to be \u201cthe premier comprehensive center providing education, services and resources\u201d for Indiana\u2019s deaf. The Hear Indiana group lauded Mr. Daniels\u2019 appointments, saying in a news release that they represent \u201cthe growing diversity of 21st century parents and children living with hearing loss\u201d and a long-overdue inclusion of the views of people who use technology like cochlear implants. \u201cToday less than 20 percent of all families choose traditional American Sign Language,\u201d the release said, \u201cthe remaining 80 percent want their children to enjoy the full range of sounds and to be able to listen and speak.\u201dKristina Swatts and her husband, Chris, got a bone-conduction hearing aid for their son Isaac when he was 9 months old. Now 22 months old, Isaac sings, dances and says scores of words, and the Swatts, who are not deaf, said they intended to send him to mainstream schools. \u201cWe want what every parent wants for their child,\u201d Mrs. Swatts said. The clash over the two approaches is complicated by conflicting and shifting statistics \u2014 for example,\u00a0cochlear implant advocates say the devices have a far higher success rate than critics claim, while A.S.L. advocates say the popularity of such devices is drastically overstated.Advocates of A.S.L. say they worry about cuts to the state budget, which included a 13 percent cut this year to $16.3 million to the School for the Deaf, and that more might be in store. But Hear Indiana says the financing is already lopsided against a spoken approach, spending far more, the group says, on the students attending the school than on the rest of the state\u2019s more than 1,800 deaf or hard-of-hearing students, who go to school elsewhere. \u201cAt the end of the day, this entire conversation is about right-sizing the budget for deaf education in Indiana,\u201d Ms. Horton said. \u201cNo one wants to take the ASL option away; we simply want to see that parents who choose listening and spoken language instruction (over placement at the Indiana School for the Deaf) have equal access to a free and appropriate public education.\u201dA spokeswoman for Mr. Daniels said that no one in his administration has been comparing the cost-effectiveness of teaching sign language versus using amplification tools because no effort is afoot to change the School for the Deaf\u2019s model of teaching. That said, Jane Jankowski, the spokeswoman, pointed to disappointing assessment results from the school, and added that the governor had no intention of undoing his appointments to its board. \u201cWe frequently appoint individuals to our boards and commissions who take a fresh look and bring new perspective and ideas,\u201d Ms. Jankowski said.

As efforts to rescue Greece for a second time come to a frenetic climax, Europe\u2019s politicians and its financial markets seem to be stuck \u2014 still \u2014 in a dialogue of the deaf.Accountable to domestic voters, and accustomed to negotiations that start with opening positions from which they later compromise, European ministers have generated a political cacophony, failing to cohere around quick and clear messages to markets. For its part, the financial sector, which has really never before had to interact with a complex multinational organism like the European Union, has struggled to make sense of its Byzantine and opaque decision-making system.The talks Tuesday night stalled over the extent to which the private sector should be involved in a new rescue, and diplomats say that a two-stage solution is now under discussion.That would produce an agreement in principle on a new rescue package in the coming days, to allow the release of the next installment of International Monetary Fund funding from the original bailout, followed by a detailed deal on the new bailout, signed off in July.The Slovak finance minister, Ivan Miklos, said as much Wednesday \u2014 after he was back home in Bratislava. \u201cThe new program should be agreed by July 11 at the latest,\u201d he told reporters after a cabinet meeting, according to Reuters.Though some of the other ministers leaving Tuesday night hinted at that outcome, others stuck to positions that chime with domestic opinion.\u201cGovernments are often speaking to their domestic political audiences or their parliamentary majority or backbench deputies as much as to the markets,\u201d said Thomas Klau, head of the Paris office of the European Council on Foreign Relations and author of a book on the euro.\u201cThe consequence of that is an amplification of division, and it means that the institutions and politicians who speak from the common European perspective often become invisible and see their credibility undermined by the spectacle of European division.\u201dThough some analysts argue that the divisions voiced are substantial \u2014 and that the markets are right to react to them \u2014 many diplomats believe that their own E.U. procedures are making matters much worse.\u201cIn the whole process this is one of the big issues,\u201d said one E.U. diplomat close to the negotiations, but not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cPoliticians can\u2019t deal with the markets. They react faster than us and then we are left in limbo.\u201d\u201cThe status quo will not continue\u201d added another E.U diplomat. \u201cEither we move forward with more economic integration or we move backward.\u201dThe European method of decision-making appears almost guaranteed to trigger uncertainty. To sanction another bailout, euro-zone nations need to get political approval back home. But voters in such countries as Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Austria are increasingly hostile.Meanwhile, the frequent ministerial meetings give the media and markets a focus point at which expectations of a deal are raised, often only to be dashed.The current impasse over Germany\u2019s insistence on the role of private investors in the next bailout highlights the difficulties.The position, made public by the country\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, would probably mean a greater private sector involvement than that deemed acceptable by the European Central Bank. But it remains unclear whether this is a firm position or a hard-line opening designed to appease deputies in the Bundestag, the German Parliament, and from which \u2014 as in previous negotiations \u2014 Berlin will compromise.\u201cIf you look at the documents, what the Germans are proposing does not always seem to be in their own economic interests, so it is not clear whether this is just for domestic consumption,\u201d said another E.U. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.In Brussels, frustration at the way the markets have behaved has crystallized around the credit rating agencies, which have, on several occasions, downgraded countries in advance of key E.U. meetings. Greece\u2019s rating was just slashed by Standard & Poor\u2019s to CCC, making it the worst-rated in the world, before the meeting Monday.Michel Barnier, the European commissioner responsible for financial services, has highlighted the rating agencies\u2019 failure to prevent the recent crisis.\u201cAt the moment one can ask serious questions on the role they are playing in the crisis that affects certain countries in the euro zone,\u201d he said. \u201cOne can ask if they take account of the efforts which these countries make to address their fiscal situation, limit their public spending and make structural reforms.\u201dAccording to Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, the markets have, in fact, detected a real lack of consensus in European capitals.\u201cEuropean leaders are divided over what policies you need,\u201d he said. \u201cThe euro is on the sick bed and the doctors cannot agree on the nature of the illness or the medicine they need to provide.\u201dIn the meantime, the politics in both the countries receiving aid, and in those offering it, have turned increasingly hostile.Mr. Klau, however, believes that the markets are still underestimating the ultimate determination of the bloc to save the single currency.\u201cThe track record shows that whenever they have been sailing into the abyss, the European body politic has summoned the political will and demonstrated its ability to rescue the eurozone,\u201d he said. \u201cNevertheless, the process is tortuous, fraught, and open to all sorts of political risks.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/theater/alan-champion-sign-language-interpreter-for-theater-dies-at-55.html", "headline": "Alan Champion, Sign-Language Interpreter for Theater, Dies at 55", "date": "2011-04-25T14:54:36+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Alan Champion, a sign-language interpreter who opened up hundreds of Broadway and regional theater productions to deaf and hard-of-hearing audience members over the last three decades, died on Friday in Ramona, Okla. He was 55.His death was confirmed by his sister, Alice Burnett. Ms. Burnett, who lives in Ramona, said Mr. Champion had moved there this month to stay with her after lengthy treatment for appendix cancer. Mr. Champion had commuted between his home in Bensalem, Pa., and Manhattan a few days a week in recent years.The son of deaf parents and himself a singer and actor, Mr. Champion was part of the team that delivered the first signed interpretation on Broadway in 1980, under the auspices of the nonprofit Theater Development Fund, for a performance of \u201cThe Elephant Man\u201d starring David Bowie. Signed performances were not formally coordinated with Broadway producers, actors and lighting technicians before then; most deaf theatergoers relied on friends in adjoining seats to interpret.\u201cI moved to New York with the dream of performing onstage,\u201d Mr. Champion said in an interview last fall. \u201cI ended up with a different kind of role. A very satisfying one.\u201dBorn in Tulsa, Okla., on July 8, 1955, Mr. Champion communicated with his parents as a toddler through the signing of his two older brothers; family members told him that he first lifted his hands to try to sign when he was 2. Raised Southern Baptist in Tulsa, Mr. Champion developed his own voice as a singer in his church choir, and in high school he performed in productions of \u201cThe Music Man,\u201d \u201cCarousel\u201d and \u201cBrigadoon.\u201d He enrolled in Oral Roberts University but left without graduating because, he said, as a gay man he did not feel comfortable at a Christian school.ImageAlan Champion in September 2010.Credit...Erin Baiano for The New York TimesMr. Champion worked as an interpreter at community colleges and theater companies in Tulsa and St. Louis before heading to New York in 1980. A month after arriving, he said, he received a letter from the Theater Development Fund announcing auditions for interpreters for Broadway shows.\u201cThe timing was uncanny,\u201d Mr. Champion recalled, \u201cand those first months taught me a whole new dimension of signing \u2014 stifling my emotional reactions during performances, and learning that I was there to interpret while the real performers were up onstage.\u201dCandace Broecker-Penn, an interpreter on the panel that helped select Mr. Champion for \u201cThe Elephant Man,\u201d said he stood out for his calm but intense work when others could become distracted or flustered by the noise and energy of the performances unfolding a few feet away. \u201cLike the best interpreters, he did not focus on literal translations, but rather conveying the words as well as the mood and feeling of the songs,\u201d said Ms. Broecker-Penn, who worked often with Mr. Champion on shows and workshops for interpreters-in-training at the Juilliard School and elsewhere.As much at ease interpreting plays like \u201cThe Elephant Man\u201d and \u201c \u2019night, Mother\u201d as he was with musicals like \u201cA Chorus Line\u201d and \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d Mr. Champion continued signing on Broadway through two rounds of chemotherapy after his cancer was diagnosed in 2009. He also worked as an interpreter for the State of New Jersey. Mr. Champion is survived by his sister and two brothers, Harold and Jerry. Deaf and hard-of-hearing patrons of Broadway, a close-knit group, often referred to Mr. Champion as their own star.\u201cI was always happiest when I would see that Alan was interpreting,\u201d said Robin Resnick, a deaf theatergoer, at a performance last fall of Broadway\u2019s \u201cPromises, Promises\u201d that Mr. Champion was signing. \u201cHe has a leading man\u2019s smile, but when the show starts, he gets down to business.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/sports/ncaabasketball/23northridge.html", "headline": "Deaf Player at Cal State Northridge Has a Real Feel for the Game", "date": "2010-12-22T19:22:54+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "ANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 During the California, Berkeley men\u2019s basketball season opener last month against Cal State Northridge, the Straw Hat Band and the student cheering section tried to rattle Matadors forward Michael Lizarraga with chants of \u201ctuna\u201d every time he touched the ball.Singling out a skilled opponent and trying to throw him off his game is a Cal tradition. It started decades ago with a successful attempt to rattle a U.C.L.A. player in a No. 42 jersey at the free-throw line by shouting, \u201cForty-twoooo!\u201d Over the years it has been shortened to \u201cTuna!\u201dBy razzing Lizarraga, a 6-foot-7 senior, the students were setting only themselves up for embarrassment. As his teammates stifled smiles at the Haas Pavilion crowd\u2019s wasted breath, Lizarraga, the only deaf men\u2019s basketball player in Division I, produced a career-best 15 points.For someone whose goal in life is to assimilate in the hearing world, being singled out for heckling on the basketball court represented the highest form of praise. In the eyes of the Cal fans, he was the Matadors\u2019 No. 42 and not \u201cthe deaf player.\u201dSpeaking through a sign language interpreter after a tournament game here in November, Lizarraga, 21, said: \u201cFor me, my biggest dream was always to play for a Division I team. There were people who said I would never be able to do it. That made me more determined.\u201cI would say my favorite quote is, \u2018Don\u2019t tell me I can\u2019t because I will.\u2019\u201dIn town to watch the Matadors play in the 76 Classic were his parents, Tavo and Cari Lizarraga, who made the trip from their Northern California home.They had been married less than a year when they took Michael, then 17 months old, to be examined by doctors for chronic ear infections. A series of tests revealed that he was profoundly deaf, a diagnosis, Cari said, that stunned and numbed them. The couple\u2019s younger child, Natalie, now 16, was also born deaf.\u201cThere\u2019s no deafness in our families,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was something that was just so unknown to us.\u201dLizarraga\u2019s parents had bonded over music, especially pop and rock. One of the hardest realities to accept, Cari said, was that the children would never be touched by the melodies so central to their lives.\u201cYou start thinking about all the things that you think that your child\u2019s going to miss out on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe turned that around real quickly.\u201dImageMichael Lizarraga communicated with his sign language interpreter Erin Matthews, right, during a game against Cal Lutheran.Credit...Danny Moloshok for The New York TimesLizarraga\u2019s parents adopted the attitude that their children\u2019s deafness would be an issue only if they made it one, which helps explain why the most vocal supporter of the Matadors during the tournament was the father of the player who cannot hear.Tavo Lizarraga was in fast-break mode for the full 40 minutes, his running commentary peppered with exhortations for his son and the other Northridge players that prompted a few bemused stares from spectators in his section.\u201cThat\u2019s why I cheer,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if Michael was hearing, I\u2019d be saying the same things.\u201dLizarraga attended a mainstream elementary school, but for his middle school and high school years, he transferred to the California School for the Deaf in Fremont, a 90-minute commute each way from his family\u2019s home in Dixon. His mother\u2019s eyes welled with tears as she recalled the conversation that precipitated the switch.\u201cHe came home from school crying one day,\u201d Cari said, \u201cand said he didn\u2019t understand why he was different, why he couldn\u2019t hear like everyone else.\u201dIn high school, Lizarraga starred in football, baseball and basketball. His coaches and teachers encouraged him to pursue athletics and academics at Gallaudet in Washington, the nation\u2019s only liberal arts university for the deaf and hard of hearing.Lizarraga had his sights set elsewhere. He chose Northridge, which houses the National Center on Deafness and has about 200 students who are deaf or hard of hearing among an enrollment of more than 35,000. He tried out for the team and earned a precious walk-on spot.The Matadors\u2019 coach, Bobby Braswell, is known for being as intense as his tirades are long. He has a stare that could bend steel, but in the course of making Lizarraga tougher, Braswell softened.Because Lizarraga absorbs information with his eyes, not his ears, Braswell has had to become more demonstrative when teaching \u2014 showing and not just screaming. As a result of working with Lizarraga, Braswell said he was more attuned to all of his players\u2019 nonverbal cues.In the beginning, Braswell said, \u201cbecause Mike didn\u2019t get a lot of playing time, he couldn\u2019t really work through his mistakes and kind of redeem himself.\u201dBraswell added, \u201cHe has such an intuitive feel for the game, he picks things up pretty fast.\u201dLizarraga, who broke into the starting lineup as a junior and started nine of the first 10 games this season, said that he could not explain how he knows when an official has blown a whistle or a teammate is trying to get his attention, just that he does.ImageMichael Lizarraga, who is deaf, communicated with assistant coach Bob Lowe with help from a sign language interpreter, Erin Matthews.Credit...Danny Moloshok for The New York Times\u201cMost of the time it\u2019s just instinct,\u201d said Lizarraga, who was averaging 6.2 points and 5.1 rebounds heading into Northridge\u2019s game Wednesday night against Santa Clara.In his pregame talk before the Matadors played DePaul here, Braswell challenged his players to follow the example of Lizarraga, who has not let obstacles turn into excuses for not succeeding. Northridge went out and handed the Blue Demons an 88-66 defeat, becoming the first Big West team to beat a Big East team since 2005.\u201cJust imagine hanging out with these guys, going places, whether it\u2019s to a restaurant, whatever it is, and you\u2019re not really being able to hear what\u2019s going on,\u201d Braswell said. \u201cTo be in the locker room and sometimes there\u2019s a sign language interpreter, sometimes there\u2019s not, and you have to deal with all those things. Guys on the bus with headphones on listening to the music and you can\u2019t do that. Because he\u2019s always smiling, you wouldn\u2019t even sense that he misses anything.\u201dLizarraga, a recreation, tourism and management major, employs humor as a bridge to the speaking world. Using pantomime and his face, which is as malleable as putty, he does imitations that his teammate Lenny Daniel described as hilarious.\u201cEvery time I\u2019m with Mike I laugh,\u201d Daniel, a senior forward, said. \u201cHe has a good spirit. When he\u2019s being a jokester, we feel like we don\u2019t have to be so self-conscious that he\u2019s deaf.\u201dTheir laughter sometimes comes at the expense of an unwitting referee, as happened at the Cal game when one approached Lizarraga to tell him something. When he failed to respond, the official moved closer and spoke louder until a Northridge player tapped him on the shoulder and, according to Daniel, said: \u201cDude, he can\u2019t hear you. He\u2019s deaf.\u201dDaniel said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re around Mike, you realize you take a lot of stuff for granted. You can\u2019t feel sorry for him because he doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019ve never met a guy like Mike in my life.\u201dKendra Blessing, a hearing student from Pennsylvania, went to Northridge to major in deaf studies because her dream is to be a sign language interpreter. She was introduced to Lizarraga last year at a bowling party, and before long they were staying up all night \u2014 signing.Last weekend, during a four-and-a-half-hour hike, they ended up under the iconic Hollywood sign where Lizarraga proposed. Blessing enthusiastically accepted. At that moment Lizarraga\u2019s future felt boundless.\u201cThe sun was setting,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail message, \u201cand it was such a clear and beautiful day, you could see the entire city.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/education/08language.html", "headline": "Colleges See 16% Increase in Study of Sign Language", "date": "2010-12-08T05:04:42+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "While the number of college students studying Spanish, French and German increased only modestly from 2006 to 2009, enrollment in American Sign Language \u0097 the fourth most-popular language \u0097 surged more than 16 percent, according to a new report from the Modern Language Association. Sign-language professors suggested various reasons for the rise. They said it reflected the growing acceptance of American Sign Language to meet college foreign-language requirements, and its usefulness as an employment credential \u0097 not only for interpreters, but also for cognitive psychologists, educators, nurses and even scuba divers. With the deep budget cuts of the recession, some universities have cut back their language programs. Even so, enrollment in foreign-language classes grew 6.6 percent from 2006 to 2009 \u0097 compared with 12.9 percent from 2002 to 2006 \u0097 according to the report, \u201cEnrollments in Languages Other Than English in United States Institutions of Higher Education, Fall 2009.\u201d \u201cThis is a vulnerable time for language study,\u201d said Rosemary Feal, executive director of the Modern Language Association. \u201cBut student interest remains strong.\u201d  Foreign-language enrollment in 2009 was 1,682,627, an all-time high. But language courses accounted for 8.6 percent of college classes, the same as in 2006. In 1965, the percentage was 16.5.And while undergraduate language study increased, especially at two-year institutions, graduate-school foreign-language enrollment declined 6.7 percent from 2006 to 2009.  As in past years, Spanish accounted for more than half of all foreign-language study. A few languages with clear geopolitical importance had larger increases than American Sign Language: Arabic, the fastest growing, was up 46 percent, Korean 19 percent and Chinese 18 percent. After long debate about whether American Sign Language is a real language \u0097 and whether it qualifies as a foreign language \u0097 a few universities now offer a major or minor in it, and many more accept sign language for their foreign-language requirement. More than 90,000 students enrolled in sign-language classes last year, compared with only 4,304 in 1995.Many colleges have long waiting lists of students trying to get into introductory A.S.L. classes, a substantial share of them turning to sign language because of their previous difficulties learning European languages. \u201cSome students take it because when they took Spanish or French in high school, it was horrific and they think this will be better,\u201d said Amy Ruth McGraw, who teaches at the University of Iowa, where about 200 students study sign language. \u201cAnd if their problem was auditory, or the accent, this might be better. But if it was memorizing vocabulary and grammar, this isn\u2019t going to be any better.\u201d According to the Modern Language Association, only about half the nation\u2019s colleges now include foreign-language study as a requirement for graduation, down from about two-thirds 15 years ago. At the University of Rochester, where the language requirement has been dropped, sign-language enrollment has remained strong. \u201cA.S.L. is our second-largest language,\u201d said Ted Supalla, director of Rochester\u2019s A.S.L. program. \u201cIt gets almost 10 percent of our undergraduates, almost equal to Spanish.\u201d It does not hurt that, in a time of high unemployment, the job market for sign-language interpreters is strong. \u201cThe demand for nationally certified A.S.L. interpreters is huge, and as a freelance interpreter, you can make $40 to $60 an hour,\u201d said Dennis Cokely, director of the A.S.L. program at Northeastern University. Many students say their interest in sign language is more about the allure of communicating without spoken words. \u201cMy generation has grown up seeing American Sign Language in television shows and movies, and it just looks so cool,\u201d said Anne Dunn, a junior at the University of Vermont. \u201cI started because we have a language requirement here. But sign language is so visual, so exciting, that I got hooked and kept going.\u201dMs. Dunn said she and others were trying to persuade the university to let them minor in American Sign Language. Many students take aesthetic pleasure in sign language. Emily Brown, a sign-language student at Wesleyan University, talks excitedly about watching deaf poetry on YouTube, and \u201crhyming\u201d words like \u201cstars\u201d and \u201csocks,\u201d whose signs share a hand shape and motion. \u201cI imagine myself painting pictures in the air,\u201d said Ms. Brown, a junior majoring in English, and serving as an A.S.L. teaching assistant. \u201cIt feels more poetic than other languages. It\u2019s such a great way to express things you can\u2019t quite express verbally.\u201d "}, {"url": "https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/an-ipad-book-for-the-deaf/", "headline": "An iPad Book for the Deaf", "date": "2010-08-19T14:59:01+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\n                                      The iPad version of \u201cDanny the Dragon Meets Jimmy\u201d comes with sign language for deaf children.\n                                    With its color screen and ability to run multiple applications, Apple\u2018s\n                                        iPad holds great promise for creating multimedia work that can redefine the nature of a book.\n                                    One new attempt to do so is \u201cDanny the Dragon Meets Jimmy,\u201d an iPad version of the well-received children\u2019s book that brings to it what the publisher, iStoryTime,\n                                        says is a first: an iPad book complete with sign language for deaf children.\n                                    The $3 app offers three versions of this charmingly illustrated work: one that children can read themselves, one that would be read to them and one signed by a woman who stands off to the side of the screen, with the\n                                        reduced-size book running next to her.\n                                    The signed version is actually a QuickTime movie, which can be paused by the user.

The documents emerge as Pope Benedict is facing other accusations that he and direct subordinates often did not alert civilian authorities or discipline priests involved in sexual abuse when he served as an archbishop in Germany and as the Vatican\u2019s chief doctrinal enforcer. The Wisconsin case involved an American priest, the Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy, who worked at a renowned school for deaf children from 1950 to 1974. But it is only one of thousands of cases forwarded over decades by bishops to the Vatican office called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, led from 1981 to 2005 by Cardinal Ratzinger. It is still the office that decides whether accused priests should be given full canonical trials and defrocked. In 1996, Cardinal Ratzinger failed to respond to two letters about the case from Rembert G. Weakland, Milwaukee\u2019s archbishop at the time. After eight months, the second in command at the doctrinal office, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, now the Vatican\u2019s secretary of state, instructed the Wisconsin bishops to begin a secret canonical trial that could lead to Father Murphy\u2019s dismissal. But Cardinal Bertone halted the process after Father Murphy personally wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger protesting that he should not be put on trial because he had already repented and was in poor health and that the case was beyond the church\u2019s own statute of limitations.\u201cI simply want to live out the time that I have left in the dignity of my priesthood,\u201d Father Murphy wrote near the end of his life to Cardinal Ratzinger. \u201cI ask your kind assistance in this matter.\u201d The files contain no response from Cardinal Ratzinger.The New York Times obtained the documents, which the church fought to keep secret, from Jeff Anderson and Mike Finnegan, the lawyers for five men who have brought four lawsuits against the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. The documents include letters between bishops and the Vatican, victims\u2019 affidavits, the handwritten notes of an expert on sexual disorders who interviewed Father Murphy and minutes of a final meeting on the case at the Vatican. Father Murphy not only was never tried or disciplined by the church\u2019s own justice system, but also got a pass from the police and prosecutors who ignored reports from his victims, according to the documents and interviews with victims. Three successive archbishops in Wisconsin were told that Father Murphy was sexually abusing children, the documents show, but never reported it to criminal or civil authorities.Instead of being disciplined, Father Murphy was quietly moved by Archbishop William E. Cousins of Milwaukee to the Diocese of Superior in northern Wisconsin in 1974, where he spent his last 24 years working freely with children in parishes, schools and, as one lawsuit charges, a juvenile detention center. He died in 1998, still a priest.Even as the pope himself in a recent letter to Irish Catholics has emphasized the need to cooperate with civil justice in abuse cases, the correspondence seems to indicate that the Vatican\u2019s insistence on secrecy has often impeded such cooperation. At the same time, the officials\u2019 reluctance to defrock a sex abuser shows that on a doctrinal level, the Vatican has tended to view the matter in terms of sin and repentance more than crime and punishment. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, was shown the documents and was asked to respond to questions about the case. He provided a statement saying that Father Murphy had certainly violated \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d children and the law, and that it was a \u201ctragic case.\u201d But he pointed out that the Vatican was not forwarded the case until 1996, years after civil authorities had investigated the case and dropped it. Father Lombardi emphasized that neither the Code of Canon Law nor the Vatican norms issued in 1962, which instruct bishops to conduct canonical investigations and trials in secret, prohibited church officials from reporting child abuse to civil authorities. He did not address why that had never happened in this case. ImageArthur Budzinski, at a cemetery behind St. John's School for the Deaf, says he was first molested in 1960 when he went to Father Murphy for confession.Credit...Jeffrey Phelps for The New York TimesAs to why Father Murphy was never defrocked, he said that \u201cthe Code of Canon Law does not envision automatic penalties.\u201d He said that Father Murphy\u2019s poor health and the lack of more recent accusations against him were factors in the decision. The Vatican\u2019s inaction is not unusual. Only 20 percent of the 3,000 accused priests whose cases went to the church\u2019s doctrinal office between 2001 and 2010 were given full church trials, and only some of those were defrocked, according to a recent interview in an Italian newspaper with Msgr. Charles J. Scicluna, the chief internal prosecutor at that office. An additional 10 percent were defrocked immediately. Ten percent left voluntarily. But a majority \u2014 60 percent \u2014 faced other \u201cadministrative and disciplinary provisions,\u201d Monsignor Scicluna said, like being prohibited from celebrating Mass. To many, Father Murphy appeared to be a saint: a hearing man gifted at communicating in American Sign Language and an effective fund-raiser for deaf causes. A priest of the Milwaukee Archdiocese, he started as a teacher at St. John\u2019s School for the Deaf, in St. Francis, in 1950. He was promoted to run the school in 1963 even though students had disclosed to church officials in the 1950s that he was a predator. Victims give similar accounts of Father Murphy\u2019s pulling down their pants and touching them in his office, his car, his mother\u2019s country house, on class excursions and fund-raising trips and in their dormitory beds at night. Arthur Budzinski said he was first molested when he went to Father Murphy for confession when he was about 12, in 1960. \u201cIf he was a real mean guy, I would have stayed away,\u201d said Mr. Budzinski, now 61, who worked for years as a journeyman printer. \u201cBut he was so friendly, and so nice and understanding. I knew he was wrong, but I couldn\u2019t really believe it.\u201d Mr. Budzinski and a group of other deaf former students spent more than 30 years trying to raise the alarm, including passing out leaflets outside the Milwaukee cathedral. Mr. Budzinski\u2019s friend Gary Smith said in an interview that Father Murphy molested him 50 or 60 times, starting at age 12. By the time he graduated from high school at St. John\u2019s, Mr. Smith said, \u201cI was a very, very angry man.\u201dIn 1993, with complaints about Father Murphy landing on his desk, Archbishop Weakland hired a social worker specializing in treating sexual offenders to evaluate him. After four days of interviews, the social worker said that Father Murphy had admitted his acts, had probably molested about 200 boys and felt no remorse.However, it was not until 1996 that Archbishop Weakland tried to have Father Murphy defrocked. The reason, he wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger, was to defuse the anger among the deaf and restore their trust in the church. He wrote that since he had become aware that \u201csolicitation in the confessional might be part of the situation,\u201d the case belonged at the doctrinal office. With no response from Cardinal Ratzinger, Archbishop Weakland wrote a different Vatican office in March 1997 saying the matter was urgent because a lawyer was preparing to sue, the case could become public and \u201ctrue scandal in the future seems very possible.\u201d Recently some bishops have argued that the 1962 norms dictating secret disciplinary procedures have long fallen out of use. But it is clear from these documents that in 1997, they were still in force.But the effort to dismiss Father Murphy came to a sudden halt after the priest appealed to Cardinal Ratzinger for leniency. In an interview, Archbishop Weakland said that he recalled a final meeting at the Vatican in May 1998 in which he failed to persuade Cardinal Bertone and other doctrinal officials to grant a canonical trial to defrock Father Murphy. (In 2002, Archbishop Weakland resigned after it became public that he had an affair with a man and used church money to pay him a settlement.) Archbishop Weakland said this week in an interview, \u201cThe evidence was so complete, and so extensive that I thought he should be reduced to the lay state, and also that that would bring a certain amount of peace in the deaf community.\u201d Father Murphy died four months later at age 72 and was buried in his priestly vestments. Archbishop Weakland wrote a last letter to Cardinal Bertone explaining his regret that Father Murphy\u2019s family had disobeyed the archbishop\u2019s instructions that the funeral be small and private, and the coffin kept closed.\u201cIn spite of these difficulties,\u201d Archbishop Weakland wrote, \u201cwe are still hoping we can avoid undue publicity that would be negative toward the church.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/theater/14deaf.html", "headline": "Hearing Man in Deaf Role Stirs Protests in New York", "date": "2009-10-13T21:06:53+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "When the playwright Rebecca Gilman began adapting the Carson McCullers novel \u201cThe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\u201d for the stage several years ago, she made a bold and controversial artistic leap: opening and ending the play with speeches by a central character, John Singer, who is deaf and mute throughout the book.The monologues turn Singer into more than the cipher he is through large swaths of the 1940 novel. But by bestowing speech on Singer, Ms. Gilman took license with a character of symbolic importance to generations of deaf readers \u0097 a decision she justified because, McCullers wrote, Singer was once taught to speak as a boy. Inevitably, though, Ms. Gilman has made it difficult for a deaf actor to play Singer, now a speaking role. The play had its premiere in Atlanta in 2005, directed by the Tony Award winner Doug Hughes (\u201cDoubt\u201d), with a hearing actor cast as Singer; it drew some strong reviews, and no objections from organizations for the deaf. But now that the play is receiving a major production at New York Theater Workshop, starting on Nov. 13, deaf actors and deaf theater groups have begun to protest the artistic and casting choices involving the Singer role.\u201cA hearing actor playing a deaf character is tantamount to putting a white actor in blackface,\u201d said Linda Bove, a deaf actress and board member of the Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts, an advocacy group for minority, disabled and deaf artists.The alliance, with the National Association of the Deaf, the Deaf West Theater and others, has demanded that Mr. Hughes and the New York Theater Workshop cast a deaf actor as Singer in the latest production \u0097 and, in doing so, fire the actor Henry Stram, who played Singer to acclaim in Atlanta and is resuming the role in New York. Rehearsals began on Tuesday.Several deaf actors put forth that demand recently at a private meeting, organized by New York Theater Workshop, with Mr. Hughes and others involved in the New York production. The discussion was emotional at times, participants on both sides said. Mr. Hughes, in an interview this week, said that he made clear at the meeting that he would not replace Mr. Stram, but that he was sympathetic to the deaf actors\u2019 concerns and was eager to work with them on a future project at the workshop.\u201cAlthough I\u2019m truly regretful that there are those in the deaf acting community who were offended by the decision I made, I cannot in good conscience fire Henry Stram in order to reduce the perceived offense,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. \u201cThere is no question that there are woefully few opportunities for deaf artists,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd people have every right to suggest to us that we have miscast this role. But we also have every right to respectfully disagree on that point.\u201dAlexandria Wailes, a prominent deaf actress who attended the meeting, said in an interview that the Singer casting decision was the latest in a string of insults by television, film and theater producers who have picked hearing actors to play deaf characters or rebuffed deaf actors who went to auditions without their own interpreters. \u201cWe were hoping to find some happy compromise or common ground, once Doug Hughes and the New York Theater Workshop understood the depth of our concerns,\u201d said Ms. Wailes, who spoke in American Sign Language, with an interpreter.

Eight names were provided; two actors auditioned for Mr. Hughes, but it was judged that neither could speak well enough to play the part of Singer. (Ms. Harley and Jim Nicola, artistic director of the New York Theater Workshop, said they fully supported the decision to keep Mr. Stram in the role.)Some leading deaf actors disputed that enough research was done in advance of the 2005 production. Among others, Ed Waterstreet, artistic director of Deaf West Theater, said in an interview that the Atlanta auditions and production had \u201cflown under the radar\u201d of deaf theater directors and actors nationally. Ms. Harley said that Deaf West Theater was among the organizations asked for names of deaf actors. Mr. Waterstreet said he had \u201cno recollection of any contact,\u201d but acknowledged he had been busy with a production of the musical \u201cBig River\u201d and that an aide might have been contacted.Mr. Stram learned sign language for \u201cThe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,\u201d though for much of the play he acts as a silent confidant for other characters who are aching to talk. While the deaf actors say they appreciate Mr. Stram\u2019s effort, they object not only to what they say is his lack of authenticity but also to the decision to have Singer speak. Mr. Waterstreet of Deaf West, among others, says the play\u2019s suggestion that speaking is the best way for a deaf character to express himself is a setback to deaf artists.One of the deaf actors who auditioned for the role of Singer in Atlanta, Lewis Merkin, said this week that he did not recall his audition with Mr. Hughes, which was why he did not protest at the time of the Atlanta production. \u201cFor me, the bigger picture matters as much as this one production \u0097 there aren\u2019t enough roles for deaf actors, and there aren\u2019t enough deaf actors being hired for deaf roles,\u201d Mr. Merkin said. \u201cAnd culturally, I do think there\u2019s a strong argument that inhabiting the role of a deaf character is something that only a deaf actor can do with true understanding.\u201d Ms. Gilman, the playwright, said in an interview that she believed her choice of allowing Singer to speak was important for the character, and she noted that she drew on McCullers\u2019s own writing for his words, including a letter in the novel that Singer wrote. In response to the protests from the deaf actors, she said she was considering \u201creimagining\u201d the opening and ending of the play so that it can be adapted for future productions to cast a nonspeaking actor in the role of Singer.Ms. Gilman has written controversial plays in her career, most notably \u201cSpinning Into Butter,\u201d which took on the reaction of liberal academics to racial discord on a campus. In this instance, though, she said she had not meant to provoke.\u201cI\u2019ve written plays where I intended to offend people, but this is not one of those plays,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m certainly open in this case to rethink the beginning and ending of the play, though I don\u2019t know quite how to do it yet. So I would need some collaborative help. But I also have to say, I don\u2019t want my play rewritten by committee.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/science/25qna.html", "headline": "A Little Hard of Hearing", "date": "2009-08-24T22:15:12+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Q.

After 70, men continue to have somewhat higher rates of hearing loss, Mr. Hoffman said, but starting at about 80, both men and women have very high, and approximately equal, rates of poor hearing. The figures are based on national studies involving interviews about hearing problems and examinations, he said. ImageCredit...Victoria Roberts\u201cAging alone is a major risk factor for hearing loss,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cWe know that other chronic conditions are associated with hearing impairment, such as diabetes and perhaps hypertension, but these do not account for the gender-specific differences.\u201d Men are more than twice as likely to report long-term exposure to loud noise, Mr. Hoffman said, \u201cso this is probably an important reason why men have worse hearing, on average, as working-age adults.\u201d  Interestingly, Mr. Hoffman said, among young adults with hearing impairment, more women than men wear hearing aids, but in those over 70, men are about 50 percent more likely to wear hearing aids than women of comparable age with hearing loss.

Researchers at the University of Hawaii tested one possibility: that sonar can deafen marine mammals. T. Aran Mooney, now at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and colleagues exposed a bottlenose dolphin to naval sonar signals and then determined whether its hearing was affected. The pings, about a half-second long and about one second apart, were recorded in Puget Sound, Washington, just before a stranding in 2005. As reported in Biology Letters, the dolphin suffered hearing loss for up to 40 minutes. But the effect was seen only with repeated exposure to the sonar pings at very high sound levels. The researchers calculated that a dolphin or other marine mammal would have to be within about 45 yards of a sonar source, and stay within that range for several minutes, for temporary deafness to occur.  It seems unlikely that an animal would stay so close to the source of a sound that was causing it discomfort, so sonar-induced deafness may not be much of a factor in strandings. But the researchers suggested that under certain conditions \u0097 multiple sonar sources, for example, or undersea features that reflect signals \u0097 an animal may not be able to avoid intense exposure."}, {"url": "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/ponzi-du-jour-regulators-say-the-deaf-were-victims/", "headline": "Ponzi du Jour: Regulators Say the Deaf Were Victims", "date": "2009-02-19T18:56:38+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\n                                    \n                                    Acting in the shadow of Bernard L.

His earliest memory of academic life is of hiding behind the classroom stove lest he be called upon to wash the lunch dishes.Now, or as close to now as Monday afternoon, Mr. Kuhlman is the teacher, sovereign of a single room in the inconspicuous brick headquarters of an adult English-literacy program here. The adult seated just inches from Mr. Kuhlman, Raul Funes, had come after working an overnight shift doing maintenance at an inn and then attending a morning class at a local technical college. He had been awake for nearly 20 straight hours.No pedagogical technique explains why Mr. Kuhlman sat so close to Mr. Funes, or why he peered so insistently into his student\u2019s face. Forty years ago, while he was a charismatic professor of economics at the University of Missouri, Mr. Kuhlman had begun inexplicably to lose his hearing. With a cochlear implant to capture sound and a practiced skill at reading lips, translating the random noise into words, he had since learned to converse face to face, particularly in quiet settings like his tutoring room.Disability enabled ability, or at least affinity. For the last four years, Mr. Kuhlman has been teaching immigrants to read and write English, to listen and speak. Like him, his students are awash in a sea of indiscriminate sound, grasping as he does for comprehension and meaning. In 90-minute individual lessons, Mr. Kuhlman currently tutors 17 students in a week, from Mexico, Thailand, Ecuador, China, El Salvador and Ukraine.\u201cIf I were religious, I\u2019d say I\u2019ve been called,\u201d Mr. Kuhlman, who is an unpaid volunteer, said during a brief lunch break between students. \u201cI just fell into it. The wheel of fate, I guess.\u201dThe workings of fate had him retire from Missouri in 1985, move to New Mexico with his wife, lose her to early death, remarry to a home economics teacher and finally, in the last innocent days of early September 2001, move with her to North Carolina to help care for a grandchild with cerebral palsy. Starting anew in his 70s, he no longer went by \u201cDr.\u201d for his Ph.D or \u201cProfessor\u201d for his rank. He is now just \u201cJohn.\u201d Fate also moved his students here. They were drawn by jobs in the factories and the fields, trading their own sacrifice for their children\u2019s American future. Those children, by age 4 or 5, often knew more English than their parents did. Only when the grown-ups felt the financial ground secure for their household \u0097 and sometimes that took 10 or 20 years \u0097 would they sign up for lessons at the Literacy Council of Buncombe County.ImageJohn Kuhlman, left, a retired college professor, helps Jose Cordova, an immigrant from Ecuador, learn English.Credit...Rebecca D\u2019Angelo for the New York TimesA few asked specifically for Mr. Kuhlman, having heard about him from friends. With 215 students and 90 more on a waiting list, most simply took whomever they were assigned. After the fact, some discovered that they were supposed to learn the English language from a man who was functionally deaf.It sounded at first like some kind of cosmic bait-and-switch, except that in practice it worked. For the student, there could be no getting away with slurs and slang when speaking to a teacher reading lips. And for the teacher, there was a sense of the shared struggle to apprehend all those elusive words.\u201cA deaf person, a person with damaged hearing, is exactly like a Spanish speaker or a Chinese speaker in a room full of English speakers,\u201d Mr. Kuhlman put it. \u201cIf I\u2019m in a room for a cocktail party, I can hear everything, but I can\u2019t understand a word. So I\u2019m pretty good at understanding their problem. I\u2019ve got empathy, sympathy, patience.\u201dMr. Kuhlman offers nothing magical by way of curriculum. He uses standard workbooks, with their vocabulary lists, short essays and fill-in-the-blank sentences. His secret ingredient is the personal touch.He knows why Mr. Funes fights sleep during their class. He knows that Jose Cordova, a student from Ecuador, just had a daughter graduate from nursing school. He knows that Adriana Gloria, from Mexico, drops her kids off at school right before her lesson. Pointing to the photographs of present and former pupils that adorn one wall of his room, Mr. Kuhlman ticks off the personal details \u0097 who runs a hair-braiding salon, who married a man who owns a bed-and-breakfast, who had to quit the lessons because of a 72-hour workweek.\u201cTo teach English, you have to talk,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd so we talk. And out of the talking, I\u2019ve become a sort of confessor. They leave here feeling better. And when I have a good day, I leave here walking on clouds.\u201dIn their eloquently imperfect way, his students agree. \u201cHe has more calm, more patience with me,\u201d said Mrs. Gloria, 41. Mr. Cordova, 50, said: \u201cWhen not understand, he explain to me. He\u2019s nice people.\u201d  \u201cHe have a lot of passion. He like to listen to any question. I have find he\u2019s very friendly.\u201d As for Mr. Funes, he still tends to nod in affirmation at questions and statements he does not understand. Mr. Kuhlman recognizes that gesture as an immigrant\u2019s survival device. And in his chats with Mr. Funes, halting as they are, he has learned some more specific reasons. Before immigrating to the United States a decade ago at the age of 17, Mr. Funes never attended school and could not read or write, even in his native language.He has been taking lessons from Mr. Kuhlman for three months now, discerning the difference between \u201cbirth\u201d and \u201cbird,\u201d reading little stories with titles like \u201cEddy\u2019s Night Out.\u201d As he recited one at his most recent lesson, he touched the tip of his pencil to each word. Mr. Kuhlman, in turn, brought his pencil to the same point, to the piece of language that formed their human bond."}, {"url": "https://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/21/out-of-baghdad-the-smaller-communities/", "headline": "Friday Prayers for the Deaf", "date": "2008-04-21T21:00:15+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "\n                                    \n                                        Video\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    At Friday prayers in Baghdad in early April, Hashem Hadi Obaid provided an energetic sign-language translation of speeches by preachers who follow the radical anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr.\n                                    In the unrelenting heat of Mr. Sadr\u2019s stronghold in the huge Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City, the 47-year-old interpreter delivered the clerics\u2019 fierce anti-Western and anti-government diatribes in a\n                                        form readily-understandable by Mr. Sadr\u2019s deaf and hard of hearing supporters.\n                                "}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/nyregion/11deaf.html", "headline": "State Says Deaf Student May Take Service Dog to School", "date": "2008-03-11T04:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "More than a year after the East Meadow School District in Nassau County barred a deaf high school student from taking his service dog to school, a state official ruled on Monday that the district had violated the state\u2019s Human Rights Law.The 21-page ruling by Kumiki Gibson, the commissioner of the Division of Human Rights, found that students with disabilities were entitled to have a service dog with them in school under state law and ordered the East Meadow district to change its policy immediately.In a phone interview, Commissioner Gibson said the ruling set a precedent for public school districts across the state, though she currently knew of no other district where the issue had been raised. \u201cState law provides for an absolute right to students with disabilities to use a guide, hearing or service dog in school,\u201d she said.The Division of Human Rights began investigating East Meadow\u2019s policy after learning that John Cave Jr., now 15, had been denied permission to take his dog \u0097 a yellow Labrador retriever named Simba \u0097 to his classes at W. Tresper Clarke, a combined middle and high school campus with 1,500 students. Leon J. Campo, the East Meadow schools superintendent, said that the district had reached its decision after concluding that having a dog in school would provide no instructional benefit to the student, and could pose a health risk to students with severe allergies and create safety issues during fire drills and practice lockdowns.

Carol Melnick, a lawyer for the district, said that the ruling would be appealed in State Supreme Court, automatically staying the order for the change of policy. John Cave\u2019s mother, Nancy, said that her son, who has cochlear implants, was trained to handle the dog and that air filters could be installed for students with allergies. She said that Simba accompanied her son almost everywhere, alerting him to sounds he cannot hear, like fire alarms or someone calling his name. In January 2007, the Cave family filed a federal lawsuit against the district over the issue, seeking $150 million in damages for a violation of John Jr.\u2019s civil rights. A federal court later dismissed the case, saying that the family had not pursued all its options with the school district.Paul J.

While her lively face is conveying her feelings, her fast-moving hands and arms elucidate her thoughts. Being deaf since birth has never deterred her. Talented and determined, she has built her stage and screen career around her gift for communication. Now, at 35, she is embarking on her greatest theatrical adventure so far.The International Visual Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, founded here in 1976 to promote the use of sign language and to present deaf actors onstage, has for the first time found a permanent home in a renovated 185-seat theater near Pigalle. And Laborit is its director and its main star.Her aim is simple: To build a bridge between deaf and hearing people by demonstrating that they can communicate perfectly with one another onstage as well as with an audience also made up of the deaf and hearing.The company's opening production, \"K. Lear,\" an adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy, with Laborit in the role of Cordelia, goes a long way toward proving her case. Imaginative, moving and eminently theatrical, the production drew full houses for three weeks in Paris before recently going on tour.No doubt part of the attraction was Laborit herself, who has been something of a household name here since 1993. That year she won a Moli\u00e8re, the French theater's top award, for her performance in \"Les Enfants du Silence,\" a French version of Mark Medoff's award-winning play \"Children of a Lesser God.\" It led to roles in numerous other plays and a dozen movies.The attention, which gave her access to government circles, was a factor in helping her raise $3.4 million in official grants to restore the crumbling century-old theater in a cul-de-sac called Cit\u00e9 Chaptal, which the company took over in 2003. By assuming the project, however, Laborit was also repaying a debt of gratitude to the International Visual Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. Almost 30 years ago it changed her life.Since the late 19th century, French education policy had banned sign language and required deaf children to be taught to lip read and, where possible, to use hearing aids and learn to speak. One early argument was that God could not be expressed in sign language. Later it was claimed that sign language further isolated the deaf.\"It is a fantasy of hearing people who want the deaf to hear,\" Laborit said through an interpreter, \"as if deafness were a handicap that should be cured.\"This was still official policy in the early 1970s whenLaborit's parents realized that their daughter was deaf. Doctors told them that she should learn to speak, but her parents were not persuaded. When Emmanuelle was 7, they heard about the International Visual Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, founded two years earlier by a deaf American theater director, Alfredo Corrado, and a French colleague, Jean Gr\u00e9mion.With the help of two other Americans, Bill Moody and Ralph Robbins, both adept at American Sign Language, they began training deaf French actors and holding workshops for deaf children. It was there that Laborit discovered sign language. \"From that day on I became a chatty and happy little girl,\" she recalled.In 1980, when she was 9, she appeared onstage for the first time in a play created and directed by Robbins. Though she would not devote herself to acting for another decade, she remained in contact with the International Visual Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, which then occupied space in the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes outside Paris. With limited resources, the company concentrated on teaching French Sign Language and was able to produce only about one play a year.After her success in \"Les Enfants du Silence\" Laborit rejoined the troupe to play the lead role in \"Antigone,\" which was presented at the 1995 Avignon Festival and toured Greece and several Asian countries.In 2002, when local authorities wanted to use their space and the theater had to leave Vincennes, Laborit was invited to join Jean-Fran\u00e7ois La Bouverie as the company's co-director. The following year she became its sole director and began planning its rebirth in its own theater in the heart of Paris. Encouragingly, French policy also changed. In 1991 schools were authorized to teach sign language; and in 2005 sign language was recognized as an official language.While deaf theater has long existed in the United States and in some European countries, the International Visual Th\u00e9\u00e2tre is unusual in that it also teaches sign language to about 800 students a year. But it is through its stage productions that the company, which has an annual budget of $2.2 million, now hopes to reach out to both deaf and hearing audiences. Surprisingly, the deaf public may prove harder to attract.\"Hearing people are more used to going to the theater,\" Laborit explained. \"For obvious reasons the deaf don't normally go to the theater. So, yes, it's normal that more hearing people attended 'K. Lear.' It will take time for the deaf to learn about this theater and to get used to coming here.\"\"K. Lear,\" adapted and directed by Marie Montegani, involved both deaf and hearing actors, some of whom also learned sign language for the occasion. Yet while the \"speaking\" gestures of the deaf actors had to be interpreted, either by other actors or occasionally on a screen behind the stage, the pace of the play never faltered, with the sign language doubling as a passionate form of choreography.In the French troupe's version of \"King Lear\" the premise is that Lear, played by Cl\u00e9mentine Yelnik, andLaborit's Cordelia are living a flashback of the tragedy that ends in their deaths.

Fernandes, the former provost trustees named in May to succeed the outgoing president of 18 years, I. King Jordan. The board said it was acting \"in the best interests of the university.\"\"Although undoubtedly there will be some members of the community who have differing views on the meaning of this decision, we believe that it is a necessity at this point,\" the trustees wrote.The victory of the protesters at Gallaudet represents a signal moment in the fight over deaf culture. It will almost certainly mean the next president must be seen as firmly committed to nurturing a deaf identity among students and advocating for deaf rights. Though opponents called Dr. Fernandes a poor leader, lacking in charisma, she herself maintained that they did not consider her culturally \"deaf enough.\"The battle over Gallaudet's future erupted at a time of massive change in the deaf world, with technological advances like cochlear implants and more effective hearing aids being felt by many in the forefront of the deaf-rights movement as an assault on deaf culture and deaf identity. The turnaround ends months of protests over the board's choice that had rippled from Gallaudet to polarize deaf communities across the United States.It is also the second consecutive time that protests forced the board's hand in choosing a president. Eighteen years ago, in a struggle that became a watershed for deaf rights, demonstrators succeeded in forcing a reluctant board of trustees to name Gallaudet's first deaf president in more than 100 years in Dr. Jordan.This time, protesters locked down the campus for several days and turned the university's entrance into a tent city of the disaffected. Last week, the protesters had seized overnight an administration building that houses the office of the president. They were forcibly removed the following morning, with at least two students suffering injuries.Dr. Fernandes, 50, who had insisted that her adversaries give her the chance to lead the university, said in a statement that she learned of the board's decision \"with deep regret.\"\"I love Gallaudet University and I believe I could have made a significant contribution to its future,\" Dr. Fernandes wrote. \"I hope that the Gallaudet community can heal the wounds that have been created. I trust that we all want a stronger, better, more inclusive Gallaudet, where A.S.L. and Deaf culture have been and always will be at the core of academic and community life.\"Demonstrators, who had vowed to shut down the campus Monday in what they called \"a day of mourning\" if the board did not agree to their demands, were euphoric upon learning that they had unseated Dr. Fernandes. Some had made the 30-mile trip to the hotel where the board met, while others rallied at the campus.Joshua Toz, a student who attended the campus protest, said in an e-mail message that \"students burst into tears of happiness\" upon hearing of their victory. \"Hands went up and mouths opened and screamed,\" he said.At a ceremony at the football field, Mr. Toz wrote, students burned an effigy of Dr. Fernandes, known on campus as J.K. \"We worked hard and finally broke the hold J.K. had on the president-designate's position. Gallaudet University is now ours,\" he wrote.Ryan Commerson, a graduate student who led the protesters, said he initially had trouble believing that the board had really given in. Leala Holcomb, another protest leader, said that she, too, was shocked.Deborah Chen Pichler, an assistant professor of linguistics, said she was \"guardedly thrilled\" that the board backed down. She said her elation was tempered by an awareness that emerged during the protests of how widespread the dissatisfaction was among students and colleagues over a range of issues at the campus, not just the choice of Dr. Fernandes.Dr. Chen Pichler said that protesters doubted Dr. Fernandes's commitment to upholding the primacy of American Sign Language on campus, and that the next person selected would have to be strongly committed to reinforcing what is often referred to as Deaf culture -- with a capital D -- at Gallaudet.Dr. Chen Pichler said the protests were \"always about more than Jane Fernandes, but she personified these bad decisions at Gallaudet that had been made for years and years.\"While the university is open to students from all traditions -- those who sign exclusively, who speak and read lips or who sign spoken language -- many protesters want the university to ban spoken language in classes and official meetings because it is easier for deaf people to understand American Sign Language.\"The next group chosen for finalists have to be sensitive to that,\" Dr. Chen Pichler said.Dr. Jordan, who had supported Dr. Fernandes to succeed him, said he was \"deeply troubled by the divisions among us and by the anger that overtook reason, respect and civility.\" His own standing had suffered in the battle over Gallaudet's next president. Though once cherished as an icon of success in the struggle for deaf rights, he now ends his tenure as president here with a no-confidence vote from his faculty.He urged unity, and thanked Dr. Fernandes for \"her dedication and courage and her standing up for what's right.\"\"Now, we must all put down our weapons of words and seek to restore a sense of community,\" he wrote.But a statement from the board also said that protesters would be held responsible for their actions of recent weeks. While respecting the right to peaceful protest, board members said, \"Individuals who violated the law and Gallaudet University's Code of Conduct will be held accountable.\"Dr. Fernandes had argued that Gallaudet's survival depended on aggressively recruiting among all deaf students, and in harnessing any available technology to help them advance. While she said American Sign Language would play a crucial role at Gallaudet, she also said, in a recent interview, that she could never envision banning spoken language at Gallaudet.

The board said it was acting \u201cin the best interests of the university.\u201d\u201cAlthough undoubtedly there will be some members of the community who have differing views on the meaning of this decision, we believe that it is a necessity at this point,\u201d the trustees wrote.The victory of the protesters at Gallaudet represents a signal moment in the fight over deaf culture. It will almost certainly mean the next president must be seen as firmly committed to nurturing a deaf identity among students and advocating for deaf rights. Though opponents called Dr. Fernandes a poor leader, lacking in charisma, she herself maintained that they did not consider her culturally \u201cdeaf enough.\u201d The battle over Gallaudet\u2019s future erupted at a time of massive change in the deaf world, with technological advances like cochlear implants and more effective hearing aids being felt by many in the forefront of the deaf-rights movement as an assault on deaf culture and deaf identity. The turnaround ends months of protests over the board\u2019s choice that had rippled from Gallaudet to polarize deaf communities across the United States. It is also the second consecutive time that protests forced the board\u2019s hand in choosing a president. Eighteen years ago, in a struggle that became a watershed for deaf rights, demonstrators succeeded in forcing a reluctant board of trustees to name Gallaudet\u2019s first deaf president in more than 100 years in Dr. Jordan.This time, protesters locked down the campus for several days and turned the university\u2019s entrance into a tent city of the disaffected. Last week, the protesters had seized overnight an administration building that houses the office of the president. They were forcibly removed the following morning, with at least two students suffering injuries.Dr. Fernandes, 50, who had insisted that her adversaries give her the chance to lead the university, said in a statement that she learned of the board\u2019s decision \u201cwith deep regret.\u201d \u201cI love Gallaudet University and I believe I could have made a significant contribution to its future,\u201d Dr. Fernandes wrote. \u201cI hope that the Gallaudet community can heal the wounds that have been created. I trust that we all want a stronger, better, more inclusive Gallaudet, where A.S.L. and Deaf culture have been and always will be at the core of academic and community life.\u201dDemonstrators, who had vowed to shut down the campus Monday in what they called \u201ca day of mourning\u201d if the board did not agree to their demands, were euphoric upon learning that they had unseated Dr. Fernandes. Some had made the 30-mile trip to the hotel where the board met, while others rallied at the campus.Joshua Toz, a student who attended the campus protest, said in an e-mail message that \u201cstudents burst into tears of happiness\u201d upon hearing of their victory. \u201cHands went up and mouths opened and screamed,\u201d he said. At a ceremony at the football field, Mr. Toz wrote, students burned an effigy of Dr. Fernandes, known on campus as J.K. \u201cWe worked hard and finally broke the hold J.K. had on the president-designate\u2019s position. Gallaudet University is now ours,\u201d he wrote.Ryan Commerson, a graduate student who led the protesters, said he initially had trouble believing that the board had really given in. Leala Holcomb, another protest leader, said that she, too, was shocked.Deborah Chen Pichler, an assistant professor of linguistics, said she was \u201cguardedly thrilled\u201d that the board backed down. She said her elation was tempered by an awareness that emerged during the protests of how widespread the dissatisfaction was among students and colleagues over a range of issues at the campus, not just the choice of Dr. Fernandes.Dr. Chen Pichler said that protesters doubted Dr. Fernandes\u2019s commitment to upholding the primacy of American Sign Language on campus, and that the next person selected would have to be strongly committed to reinforcing what is often referred to as Deaf culture \u2014 with a capital D \u2014 at Gallaudet.Dr. Chen Pichler said the protests were \u201calways about more than Jane Fernandes, but she personified these bad decisions at Gallaudet that had been made for years and years.\u201dWhile the university is open to students from all traditions \u2014 those who sign exclusively, who speak and read lips or who sign spoken language \u2014 many protesters want the university to ban spoken language in classes and official meetings because it is easier for deaf people to understand American Sign Language. \u201cThe next group chosen for finalists have to be sensitive to that,\u201d Dr. Chen Pichler said.Dr. Jordan, who had supported Dr. Fernandes to succeed him, said he was \u201cdeeply troubled by the divisions among us and by the anger that overtook reason, respect and civility.\u201d His own standing had suffered in the battle over Gallaudet\u2019s next president. Though once cherished as an icon of success in the struggle for deaf rights, he now ends his tenure as president here with a no-confidence vote from his faculty.He urged unity, and thanked Dr. Fernandes for \u201cher dedication and courage and her standing up for what\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cNow, we must all put down our weapons of words and seek to restore a sense of community,\u201d he wrote.But a statement from the board also said that protesters would be held responsible for their actions of recent weeks. While respecting the right to peaceful protest, board members said, \u201cIndividuals who violated the law and Gallaudet University\u2019s Code of Conduct will be held accountable.\u201dDr. Fernandes had argued that Gallaudet\u2019s survival depended on aggressively recruiting among all deaf students, and in harnessing any available technology to help them advance. While she said American Sign Language would play a crucial role at Gallaudet, she also said, in a recent interview, that she could never envision banning spoken language at Gallaudet. In a faculty vote several weeks ago, 82 percent of the faculty demanded that she step down."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/education/university-for-deaf-resumes.html", "headline": "University for Deaf Resumes", "date": "2006-10-17T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Classes resumed at Gallaudet University, the nation's only liberal arts university for the deaf, though protesters opposed to the board's choice of a new president continued to block the main gate.

Both companies are lean organizations that hire actors on an as-needed basis.By all accounts the Connecticut theater's problems stem largely from the 19 months that Charles M. Roper was its executive director. Fired in 1994 after an audit discovered irregularities, Mr. Roper pleaded guilty three years later to having embezzled $105,000 of the organization's money to cover vacation expenses and to buy clothes, antiques and other items. He was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison. Besides leaving the organization with disorganized finances and debts, Mr. Roper also saddled his successors with a spotty financial record in Washington's eyes, because of liberties taken on his watch with federal grant money.Dr. Winters, who joined the board in 2001 and became the theater's executive director in early 2003, inherited an organization that still had problems. While his predecessors had budgets of $1 million and $2 million a year, he has kept annual spending to about $300,000, according to the organization's audited financial statements. That has meant closing a well-regarded summer training academy for deaf and hard-of-hearing actors and shelving productions for adults, leaving the company tightly focused on a children's theater group that performed at 114 schools and other sites last year.Still, the budget tightening did not eliminate the threat posed by the deal the theater entered into in 1988 under a program that the National Endowment has since discontinued. At the time the endowment offered the theater one matching dollar, up to $150,000, for every $3 it raised. The theater met the challenge and used the combined $600,000 to create an endowment and a working capital fund in 1991, its financial statements show. Under the terms of the grant, the theater was forbidden to touch the $247,000 in principal that it set aside from those funds as a permanent endowment.But eventually financial obligations, made worse by mismanagement under Mr. Roper, led the theater to spend down the entire endowment, its financial statements note. Subsequently the National Endowment demanded repayment of the $150,000 grant. Four amendments to the repayment schedule were recorded between February 1998 and June 2004, with the latest revision giving the theater until early 2007 to make its final repayment.Correspondence shows that the theater had paid half of what it owed before it stopped making payments altogether in April 2005, about the same time that the federal money it was receiving from the education department also halted, in a shift of governmental priorities. Technically the theater has missed five payments totaling $41,250. Yet the endowment has exercised its right under the agreement to call for immediate repayment of the entire $75,000 balance as well as interest.Connecticut sent the first of four $50,000 checks to the theater in mid-July, but because it used an outdated address, the check never arrived. Now, Mr. Sullivan said, he has little choice but to ask the state to do something it does rather well: drag its feet on reissuing the check.\"We will ask the state to sit on the funds until this can be sorted out because clearly we do not want to be writing the check to the N.E.A.,\" he said. \"We already send a lot more money to Washington than we get back in Connecticut.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/10/theater/10deaf.html", "headline": "Money Woes Threaten National Theater of the Deaf", "date": "2006-08-10T04:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "For nearly four decades it has provided a cultural bridge between the hearing and the hearing-impaired, but unless federal and state agencies come to some agreement about its financing, the National Theater of the Deaf may be unable to carry on much longer.

Yet the endowment has exercised its right under the agreement to call for immediate repayment of the entire $75,000 balance as well as interest.Connecticut sent the first of four $50,000 checks to the theater in mid-July, but because it used an outdated address, the check never arrived. Now, Mr. Sullivan said, he has little choice but to ask the state to do something it does rather well: drag its feet on reissuing the check. \u201cWe will ask the state to sit on the funds until this can be sorted out because clearly we do not want to be writing the check to the N.E.A.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe already send a lot more money to Washington than we get back in Connecticut.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/sports/baseball/deaf-to-boos-rodriguez-finally-hears-the-cheers.html", "headline": "Deaf to Boos, Rodriguez Finally Hears the Cheers", "date": "2006-06-29T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Alex Rodriguez must have heard the boos when he failed to reach base in the 1st and 10th innings, and again in the 11th when he made an error.

Hot Stove and Off-Season UpdatesLocked Out: With M.L.B. and its player union unable to come to terms on a new collective bargaining agreement, the league enacted a lockout, freezing all transactions and starting baseball\u2019s first work stoppage since the 1994-95 strike.Little Movement:\u00a0In a pair of negotiating sessions, M.L.B. made an offer\u00a0and the union countered. Delays could eventually impact spring training or the start of the regular season.Women to Watch:\u00a0In a pair of significant firsts, Genevieve Beacom\u00a0pitched professionally for one of Australia\u2019s top teams and Rachel Balkovec\u00a0was named as the manager of a team in the Yankees\u2019 minor league system.Getting Their Guy:\u00a0The Mets finally found a general manager\u00a0and Steven Cohen, the team\u2019s owner, says the move got universal praise at the owners\u2019 meetings.Free-Agency Tracker:\u00a0Look back at some of the signings, contract extensions and trades\u00a0that happened before the lockout began.So criticism even came from the YES analyst David Justice, who after Tuesday's loss said that the statistics showed that Rodriguez was not the top player the Yankees would want batting with the score 2-2 in the seventh.\"Alex has gone from town to town, and there's been just resentment all over the league for him because of how much money he makes,\" Manager Joe Torre said before the game. \"And nobody ever feels that anybody's worth this money.

Proctor's 95-mile-an-hour fastball found the heart of the plate and was drilled over the left-field fence for the Braves' first run since the sixth inning.Proctor looked good moments earlier. He entered in bottom of the 11th inning with the bases loaded and two outs and induced a pop-up by Wilson Betemit to end the threat. Ron Villone (1-1) relieved Proctor and induced a lineout to shortstop with the bases loaded and two outs to pick up the victory.Asked if he was the second-most-relieved person in the stadium after Rodriguez's homer, Proctor said, \"I think I was the most.\"The Yankees were down to their final two outs when Jorge Sosa (2-10) walked Jason Giambi, who was replaced by pinch-runner Kevin Reese. Rodriguez was the next batter, and he took two balls, a strike and a ball before going from goat to star.\"He's going to be fine,\" Derek Jeter said of Rodriguez. \"Everyone struggles at times. He knows how to hit.\"For the first eight innings, the game was a pitchers' duel between Chien-Ming Wang and John Smoltz.Wang gave up the first of the two earned runs he surrendered in the fourth inning, when \u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda scored from third base on Andruw Jones's double. The Braves took a 2-0 lead when Wang allowed three consecutive singles with two outs in the sixth inning, the last of them, by Brian McCann, scoring Chipper Jones from third.Wang surrendered seven hits in eight innings, striking out two batters while walking one. \"Wang did an outstanding job,\" Jeter said.Smoltz was pitching for the first time since leaving his previous start, on June 23, during the second inning with a strained right groin muscle. He showed few lingering effects, scattering six hits over seven innings. The earned run he surrendered came in the sixth inning, when Rodriguez hit a ground ball that bounced off Smoltz's glove. It was fielded by Giles at second base as Melky Cabrera scored to cut the Braves' lead to 2-1. Rodriguez was out at first.Braves General Manager John Schuerholz said that Smoltz would not be traded after Smoltz raised that possibility in conversations with members of the news media. But if the Braves continue to lose at a dizzying clip, Schuerholz's thinking might change. So, in a way, Smoltz may have been auditioning for his next employer. The Yankees could certainly use a pitcher of his caliber down the stretch, as could Boston and Detroit, the organization in which Smoltz's minor league career began in 1986.The Yankees still trailed by 2-1 with one out in the eighth when Giambi hit a bases-empty homer off Ken Ray, who relieved Smoltz. The ball caromed off the front of the upper deck in right field, giving the Yankees new life.\"Jason's been swinging the bat very well,\" Jeter said. \"It seems like everything he hits is a home run.\"The Braves have one of the most porous bullpens in the National League, yet three of their relievers held the Yankees without a hit between the 9th and 11th innings.The Yankees went to Mariano Rivera with the score tied at 2-2 to start the ninth.

Dodd of Connecticut and Tom Harkin of Iowa, both Democrats who have been trying to reinstate the funds, said they had no idea who pulled the plug or why.The program was part of landmark legislation that promised people with disabilities equal educational opportunities. But without the grants, the affected organizations, which produce theatrical fare seen in schools, libraries and other public places throughout the country, are worried about staying solvent.The National Theater of the Deaf, based in West Hartford, Conn., the group that many credit with pioneering the field, had been getting $687,000 a year from Washington until the last of its federal grants ran out in mid-2005. Since 1967, it has been producing shows that feature deaf and hearing actors who communicate in a combination of American Sign Language and spoken English. The company estimates that its shows have been seen by 3.5 million people throughout the world. Now the theater has gone two years without putting on a show for adults and without conducting its summer training academy for deaf and hard-of-hearing actors.\"Right now, we're looking just to keep the theater alive,\" said Paul L. Winters, the group's executive director. \"It's a national treasure that we would hate to lose.\"In North Hollywood, Calif., the Deaf West Theater Company, which won critical acclaim for its adaptation of the Tony Award-winning musical \"Big River,\" which went to Broadway in 2003, is having to make do without the $800,000 a year that Washington was sending its way. When the show toured Washington after playing on Broadway, the first lady, Laura Bush, included it in a special presidential gala last summer, where both she and the education secretary, Margaret Spellings, praised it generously.\"Somebody, somewhere, must have been looking for every penny they could, because it's not a lot of money,\" said Deaf West's managing director, Bill O'Brien, referring to the $2 million that Washington was doling out each year to qualified cultural programs for the deaf. Other community and educational organizations in or near New York, Chicago, Hartford, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington had also received five- and six-figure grants and are now feeling the pinch.The money they lost was cut from the 2004 reauthorization bill for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which had allowed the Office of Special Education Programs to award discretionary grants to organizations that provide cultural experiences that \"enrich the lives of deaf and hard-of-hearing children and adults.\" That group, according to federal estimates, can range anywhere from a small fraction of 1 percent of the population up to about 3 percent, depending on the extent of the hearing loss; if everyone who reports any hearing difficulty is included, the estimates rise as high as 14 percent.The Dec. 22, 2004, e-mail message that notified Dr. Winters of the impending change offered no rationale for it, but closed with a cheery \"Holiday Greetings!\"Since then, he has been trying to keep his organization afloat. Not only did he put himself on furlough to cut his pay last year from $75,000 to $48,500, but he also takes his turn with the scrub brush every fifth week to clean toilets at the cottage his theater company leases for its headquarters from the American School for the Deaf in West Hartford.Financial statements show he has cut costs to $560,000 in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2005, from the $1 million that was spent in fiscal 2004, his first year at the helm. Since then, he has furloughed staff members whenever schools were closed to rein in the payroll, and he forgives his deaf colleagues who refer to him in American Sign Language with the same slashing motion that denotes the word \"ax.\"Today, his company's slimmed-down theatrical offerings revolve mostly around the Little Theater of the Deaf, which stages children's shows that can be understood by the hearing and the hearing-impaired. At a recent performance at New City Elementary School in Rockland County, N.Y., students had prepared for the event by learning about American Sign Language; they practiced applauding by fluttering their fingers overhead. The show was called \"Fingers Around the World -- Next Stop: South of the Border,\" and the dialogue veered from spoken English and Spanish to American Sign Language and Mexican Sign Language. \"Are you a talking cactus?\" Naomi Ekperigin asked Christopher DeSouza, who took on extra parts in the show to save the cost of an additional cast member.\"I'm a signing cactus,\" he corrected her.Sue Dello, a third-grade teacher at the school, expressed hope that Washington might restore the financing, adding that the play gave her students exposure to a world that \"they don't get sitting in their nice homes in suburbia.\"Because of the popularity of \"Big River,\" Deaf West Theater has had some money to cushion the fall. Still, 60 percent of the $1.2 million in \"revenue and support\" that it reported in 2004 came from federal financing, according to its latest financial statements. \"We are definitely starting to feel the pinch that the National Theater of the Deaf is feeling,\" Mr. O'Brien said. \"I would bet that the person who struck through this priority had no idea what was being accomplished with that money. That deaf people were back on Broadway for the first time since 'Children of a Lesser God,' and that all of this was happening for those few dollars.\"Patricia Scherer, founder of the International Center on Deafness and the Arts in Northbrook, Ill., credits her 32-year-old program with nurturing the aspirations of people like Marlee Matlin, a former drama student in her programs who went on to win an Academy Award for best actress in 1986. The $100,000 in federal grants that the center received in fiscal 2001, 2002 and again in 2003 for theatrical projects made up one-fifth of its total budget. Commenting on Congress's decision to cut programs for the deaf, she said she could only surmise that deaf people had suffered \"because they can't scream loud enough\" and could not swing elections.Invited to a reception at the White House last June, on the day he was to perform the part of Mark Twain in a segment from \"Big River,\" Mr. O'Brien took Secretary Spellings aside to make his well-rehearsed pitch. He said he let her know that the production would never have had the chance to go to Broadway or on tour without the $4 million over all that Deaf West had received from the very program that Washington was dismantling. \"She told me to keep her posted,\" he said.When asked recently whether Secretary Spellings planned to involve herself in this matter, her spokesman, Jim Bradshaw, said, \"We defer to Congress's judgment on this one.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/02/nyregion/the-neediest-cases-coping-with-deafness-blindness-and.html", "headline": "The Neediest Cases; Coping With Deafness, Blindness and Schizophrenia", "date": "2006-01-02T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Kimtheresa Moore is deaf, but she can still hear voices.

But they are impervious to her attacks.Only medication can quiet the voices and erase shadows that lie in the recesses of her mind. But sometimes, the voices and shadows are Ms. Moore's only company.Her life could be documented as a long string of misunderstandings.When she was a little girl, she was slapped because her mother thought she was ignoring her.Eight years ago, Ms. Moore's husband left and moved to Mississippi; their arguments had been exacerbated by her condition. The family speculates that he may have been killed in Hurricane Katrina. They have not heard from him.It is hard enough to be a single mother of four and a grandmother of one in East New York, Brooklyn. But being a deaf, schizophrenic single mother and grandmother is a herculean task.\"It was overwhelming for me,\" Ms. Moore said. \"I had problems, and no one helped me. I didn't understand what to do.\"With a referral from the city government, the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, a beneficiary of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, placed a homemaker with the family six days a week to help with housework and care for her grandson, Anthony.Ms. Moore's 16-year-old son, Azariah, serves as a bridge to the outside world. He was born partially deaf. He, too, has been found to be schizophrenic, and he has to take pills every day to stay rooted in the world.Azariah can speak English and use sign language, so he serves as his mother's interpreter, translating her signing for the rest of the world.They are seldom apart. \"It's hard to disconnect from him,\" Mrs. Moore said. \"He is my baby. We never go anywhere without each other.\"She cries when he leaves for summer camp.Azariah also is unable to feel physical pain. He says that he feels touch but not the pain of a punch. Once, when he was 7 or 8, he was burned when a hot iron fell on him and he did not feel it sear his skin.At school, classmates threw rocks at him and beat him up, to see if he was really the freak they had heard about.What Azariah does feel, though, is emotional pain, particularly empathy with his mother. \"Whatever she feels, I feel,\" he said. \"If she's upset, I'm upset, and I kick myself.\"Since his father left, Azariah sees himself as the protector of not only his mother, but also his entire family. Pointing to her son, Ms. Moore dragged her thumb up along her chest, the sign for \"proud.\"Azariah dropped out of school, in part, he said, because of the attacks by his classmates. He said that \"without my dad, I'm struggling.\" He added that he was \"trying to get a job.\"Meanwhile, the family survives on welfare and food stamps.The Brooklyn Bureau, however, has tried to offer more help. It recently used $994 from the Neediest Cases to buy three twin beds, three dressers, and $100 clothing gift certificates for the children. Before then, their clothing was stored in plastic bags and milk crates.Ms. Moore likes the small rituals in life, like gossiping about men with her friends and praying. She feels comfort in being with her children, especially Azariah.\"Not only is she my mom, she is my best friend,\" he said. \"I have to be here for her through thick and thin. I want to be here for her through good times and bad.\"That is my main goal in life: to support my mom and keep her happy.\"In response to Azariah, Ms. Moore signed three fingers up, fingers closed in a circle, three fingers up: \"Wow.\"The walls of loneliness can be surmounted, but only with someone calling you out from the other side.HOW TO HELPChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245, or any of these organizations:BROOKLYN BUREAU OF COMMUNITY SERVICE 285 Schermerhorn Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217CATHOLIC CHARITIES, DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS 191 Joralemon Street Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201CATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK 1011 First Avenue New York, N.Y. 10022CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010COMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK 105 East 22nd Street New York, N.Y. 10010FEDERATION OF PROTESTANT WELFARE AGENCIES 281 Park Avenue South New York, N.Y. 10010UJA-FEDERATION OF NEW YORK Church Street Station P.O.

My flight from Atlanta to New York had been canceled. The next flight was supposed to leave at 9 p.m., but by 8:45 p.m., we still hadn't boarded. Someone finally came over to tell me the flight was now scheduled for 11 p.m. and that it would be a different flight, going to John F. Kennedy Airport instead of La Guardia.

That has not been a simple desire, since her daughter Arielle, 10, has moderate-to-severe hearing loss, a disability that has often confounded or been ignored by cultural institutions.Ms. Schacter's complaints stem mainly from the way institutions have interpreted the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 as it pertains to people with hearing loss. She discovered the problem firsthand, taking her daughter to Disney World, to museums, to the theater.\"We had been continually frustrated wherever we went,\" she said in an interview at her Upper East Side home. \"Equipment wasn't available; it was broken; the signs weren't there telling you what was available. It seemed as though companies were committed to providing access but they couldn't get it right.\"That frustration turned her into an activist, representative of a band of parent-advocates who through their persistence get things done. Early on, Ms. Schacter's persistence won her the support of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, whose president, Inez Janger, could relate to her sense of mission.\"I got involved with A.G. Bell because I have a deaf kid, not because I had a passion for deaf children,\" said Ms. Janger, who gave Ms. Schacter clout by endorsing her not-for-profit Hearing Access Program, which aims to help cultural and entertainment institutions provide equipment for people with hearing loss.Ms. Schacter has not hesitated to get up in the middle of a theater performance, bumping knees and blocking views, to find someone to complain to about a failure in the audio equipment. At Disney World she did not suffer in silence when her daughter was sidelined by inadequate facilities at various performances; instead, she had several conversations with the executive in charge of services for guests with disabilities on how to make things better. When the Museum of the City of New York did not meet her demands, she called in a government regulator.Ms. Schacter, 42, was once a practicing lawyer. Then her first child died during delivery. Later, Arielle was born and her hearing loss was diagnosed when she was 21/2. Through tragedy and trouble, Ms. Schacter became a stay-at-home mother and, after that, a crusader.\"She can be a little aggressive in going after what she wants,\" said Laurie Hanin, an audiologist who is executive director of the League for the Hard of Hearing, which provides services for the deaf and hard of hearing and is affiliated with the Hearing Access Program. \"But when you look at it from the perspective that she's the parent of a child who, with accommodations, could enjoy everything a normal hearing child could, then you understand.\"In other words, Ms. Schacter is not just another crank, a Seinfeldian character whose endgame is refining the complaint. \"She has helped raise the consciousness to a different level,\" said Linda Wernikoff, deputy superintendent in the New York City Department of Education's office for special education. \"She offers a solution.\"At the American Museum of Natural History, for example, she introduced neck loops, devices that connect audio guides to hearing aids that have a T-coil switch, providing extra amplification. The museum also used her suggestions, along with those of others, for upgrading its accessibility signs and rear captioning system, which allows captions to be displayed at individual seats in theaters.\"Her input was extremely helpful,\" said Elisabeth Werby, senior director of government relations at the museum.Still, the crank factor is a worry. Ms. Werby wanted to make sure other potential complainants understand that she took Ms. Schacter seriously because she was so prepared, and that she came with the approval of established organizations like the Alexander Graham Bell Association. \"When she called she was clearly someone who had knowledge and information,\" Ms. Werby said. \"And organizational affiliation is important.\"Ms. Schacter can be formidable. When she visited the Museum of the City of New York 18 months ago, she found no assistive listening devices, inadequate signage and no infrared system in the auditorium. The museum, in her opinion, did not respond to her suggestions quickly enough, so she complained to city officials.\"Art and theater so personally affect you,\" said Ms. Schacter. \"You can't just eliminate them from your life, especially if you live in New York City. Imagine if you couldn't go to the theater or to museums because your child couldn't hear. It would be one thing if you didn't have a choice. But if it is a simple, inexpensive technology, they should have it.\" After research and discussion, the museum bought listening devices and is redesigning its Web site to clarify what is available, a spokeswoman said.Timothy Thayer, an assistant commissioner in the Department of Cultural Affairs who was involved with the situation, fumbled a bit to find just the right description for Ms. Schacter's approach.\"Janice is terribly well meaning,\" he said. \"She would have preferred that the museum buy more than they were legally required to do, but then a compromise was reached.\"Ms. Schacter does not hold a grudge. \"It is hard for them to understand why this is important when they have crumbling museum issues,\" she acknowledged, and then praised the museum. \"I think what they've done to address the issue is fabulous.\"People in the advocacy business say that being a pain in the neck is part of the job. \"It would be nice if she could go have one conversation and everything would be taken care of,\" said Celia Hughes, executive director of VSA arts of Texas, an organization that deals with matters of the arts and disability, who has worked with Ms. Schacter. \"Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.\"The John F.

Miller, who is deaf, envisions the town he wants to create here: a place built around American Sign Language, where teachers in the new school will sign, the town council will hold its debates in sign language and restaurant workers will be required to know how to sign orders.Nearly 100 families -- with people who are deaf, hard of hearing or who can hear but just want to communicate in sign language -- have already publicly declared their intention to live in Mr. Miller's village, to be called Laurent, after Laurent Clerc, a French educator of the deaf from the 1800's.Planners, architects and future residents from various states and other countries are gathering at a camp center in South Dakota on Monday and through the week to draw detailed blueprints for the town, which could accommodate at least 2,500 people. Mr. Miller, who has been imagining this for years, intends to break ground by fall.\"Society isn't doing that great a job of, quote-unquote, integrating us,\" Mr. Miller, 33, said through an interpreter. \"My children don't see role models in their lives: mayors, factory managers, postal workers, business owners. So we're setting up a place to show our unique culture, our unique society.\"While deaf enclaves, like the one that existed in Martha's Vineyard decades ago, have cropped up throughout the nation, this would be the first town expressly created for people who sign, its developers say. Even the location, in sparsely populated South Dakota, was selected with the intent of rapidly building political strength for the nation's millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing people, a group that has won few elected offices around the country.But in the complicated political world of deaf culture, Laurent is an increasingly contentious idea. For some, like Mr. Miller; his wife, Jennifer, who is also deaf; and their four deaf children, it seems the simplest of wishes: to live in a place where they are fully engaged in day-to-day life. Others, however, particularly advocates of technologies that help deaf people use spoken language, wonder whether such a town would merely isolate and exclude the deaf more than ever.\"We think there is a greater benefit for people to be part of the whole world,\" said Todd Houston, executive director of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in Washington. \"I understand the desire to be around people like ourselves, and I don't have a problem with that, but I don't think it's very wise. This is a little bit of circling-the-wagons mentality, if you ask me.\"Over the past 15 years, he said, it has become easier for the deaf and hard of hearing to grow up using spoken language, because of a steady rise in the use of cochlear implants, more early diagnoses and therapies for deaf children and efforts to place some deaf children in mainstream schools. That fact has set off intense political debate over what it means to be deaf and what mode of communication -- signing or talking -- the deaf should focus on.Those who want to live in Laurent, though, say their intent is not exclusivity at all, but the inclusion of diverse people, especially those who do not have the luxury of communicating with speech. \"We are not building a town for deaf people,\" said M.E. Barwacz, Mr. Miller's mother-in-law and his business partner in creating Laurent. \"We are building a town for sign language users. And one of the biggest groups we expect to have here is hearing parents with deaf children.\"Ms. Barwacz, who intends to live in Laurent, is not deaf. She has two daughters, one deaf and one not, and eight grandchildren, four of them deaf. Nationally, experts report that some 90 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents, setting up a quandary, in some cases, about what language to use in a single household.As early as the 1800's, deaf leaders debated the possibility of a \"deaf state,\" said Gerard Buckley, an official at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester. But the notion came and went. Elsewhere, because of proximity to schools and businesses tied to the deaf, large concentrations of deaf people have gathered in cities like Rochester; Washington; Olathe, Kan.; Frederick, Md.; and Sioux Falls, S.D.The difference in Laurent, say some among the 92 families who have reserved spaces in the town from as far as London and Australia, is that every element of it would be designed with them in mind. The homes and businesses, they said, would incorporate glass and open space for easy visibility across wide distances. Fire and police services would be designed with more lights and fewer sirens. High-speed Internet connections would be available all over town, since the Internet and Video Relay Service have become vital modes of communication for deaf people. And any shops, businesses or restaurants would be required to be sign-language friendly.Here in Salem, a dusty 125-year-old farming town of 1,300 three miles from the proposed site of Laurent, people seem unsure of what to make of the idea. \"No one has ever come along and tried to start a town,\" said Joseph Kolbeck, the local barber.Along the quiet main drag through town, Mr. Miller and Ms. Barwacz, who are originally from Michigan, recently opened a storefront in the old King Koin Laundromat to create and promote Laurent. They moved to Salem not long ago, choosing the area after surveying nearly the entire country looking at factors like population, climate and cost of land.Some people here wonder how the proposed town of 2,500 would mesh with McCook County's 6,000 residents and its economy of corn, cows and pigs. Others say they doubt Laurent will ever become reality.Mr. Miller and Ms. Barwacz have revealed little about the costs and their plans for financing Laurent. They say they are using family money, as well as some from a group of \"angel investors,\" led by a man with a deaf daughter who wishes to remain anonymous. First Dakota National Bank is helping to secure financing, and the two have optioned 275 acres so far. They say they are spending about $300,000 for the planning work during the meetings that will end on Saturday. Those who have reserved spaces in Laurent will be expected to put down $1,000 deposits for condominiums and home lots within the next few months.For many of those people -- from states like California, Florida and New York -- a move to prairie land in South Dakota (population 760,000) would seem to be an enormous culture shock. But they plan to start businesses like shops and restaurants, gas stations and hotels, and the benefits, many of them say, outweigh any concerns they have about the location.Lawrence J. Brick, a retired school administrator from Philadelphia, said Laurent held attractions that most hearing people would struggle even to grasp: no longer having to shy away from the neighbors, fearing he could not communicate; no longer having to guess what a store clerk is saying about a price; no longer having to apologize for being deaf.Although some people argue that Laurent might isolate deaf people, H-Dirksen L. Bauman, who directs the master's program in deaf studies at Gallaudet University, said the plans actually marked an important collaboration between the deaf and the hearing, one of a sort not always encouraged by the deaf community. This is especially significant, he said, as more hearing people are learning American Sign Language, now the fifth most-studied language on college campuses.\"Hearing people are not welcomed in deaf residential schools, in deaf clubs,\" Mr. Bauman said. \"But there is no audiogram you will need to buy land in Laurent, South Dakota. There's simply a commitment to live in a visually centered environment that supports manual as opposed to spoken language.\"But Dr. Michael Novak of Urbana, Ill., who has been performing cochlear implants since 1984, said he was convinced that the trend among the deaf was actually shifting toward therapies that could help the next generation of deaf people use spoken language.\"Communities like this have a real place for people who cannot or choose not to use the hearing technology,\" Dr. Novak said of Laurent. \"But over time, that number will be reducing.\" He wonders then, he said, if the future of a notion like Laurent might fade away.For his part, though, Mr. Miller said reports of the \"death of sign language and deaf culture continue to be greatly exaggerated.\" Not everyone, he said, is eligible for or would even want to receive technologies like cochlear implants. \"I do not want one for myself,\" he said. \"I am very happy being deaf. To me, this is like asking a black or Asian person if he/she would take a pill to turn into a white person.\"Correction: April 1, 2005, Friday A map on March 21 with an article about plans for a town for deaf people in South Dakota, to be called Laurent, mislabeled the highway running north and south through Sioux Falls.

The finding suggests that the brain naturally breaks complex concepts into smaller components, indicating a dedicated neural machinery for language.The Nicaraguan children are well known to linguists because they provide an apparently unique example of people inventing a language from scratch. The phenomenon started at a school for special education founded in 1977 by Hope Somoza, the wife of the Nicaraguan dictator, and later expanded by the Sandinista government. Instructors noticed that the deaf children, while absorbing little from their Spanish lessons, had developed a system of signs for talking to one another. As one generation of children taught the system to the next, it has evolved from a set of gestures into a far more sophisticated form of communication, and today's 800 users of the language provide a living history of its stages of formation.The children have been studied principally by Dr. Judy Kegl, a linguist at the University of Southern Maine, and by Dr. Ann Senghas, a cognitive scientist at Columbia University. In the latest study, published in the current issue of Science, Dr. Senghas shows that the younger children have now decomposed certain gestures into smaller component signs. A hearing person asked to mime a standard story about a cat waddling down a street will make a single gesture, a downward spiral motion of the hand. But the deaf children have developed two different signs to use in its place. They first sign a circle for the rolling motion and then a straight line for the direction of movement.This requires more signing, but the two signs can be used in combination with others to express different concepts. The development is of interest to linguists because it captures a principal quality of human language -- discrete elements usable in different combinations -- in contrast to the one sound, one meaning of animal communication. \"The regularity she documents here -- mapping discrete aspects of the world onto discrete word choices -- is one of the most distinctive properties of human language,\" said Dr. Steven Pinker, a cognitive scientist at Harvard.When people with no common language are thrown into contact, they often develop an ad hoc language known to linguists as a pidgin, usually derived from one of the parent languages. Pidgins are rudimentary systems with minimal grammar and utterances of the \"Me Tarzan, you Jane\" variety. But in a generation or two the pidgins acquire grammar and somehow become upgraded into what linguists call creoles.Though many new languages have been created by the pidgin-creole route, the Nicaraguan situation is unique, Dr. Senghas said, because its starting point was not a complex language but ordinary gestures. From this raw material, the deaf children appear to be spontaneously fabricating the elements of language. Sign languages can possess all the properties of language, including grammar, and differ only in conveying meaning by signs instead of speech.Until now, children's specific contribution to language has been hard to define because they end up speaking like their parents. By inventing a new language from scratch, the Nicaraguan children afford linguists the chance to identify children's role in language creation. Dr. Senghas's work shows \"that children can give the language certain regularities instead of merely extracting them\" from their parents' speech, Dr. Pinker said.Linguists have been engaged in a longstanding argument as to whether there is an innate, specialized neural machinery for learning language, as proposed by Noam Chomsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or whether everything is learned from scratch. Dr. Senghas says her finding supports the view that language learning is innate, not purely cultural, since the Nicaraguan children's disaggregation of gestures appears to be spontaneous. Her result also upholds the idea that children play an important part in converting a pidgin to a creole. Because children's minds are primed to learn the rules of grammar, it is thought, they spontaneously impose grammatical structure on a pidgin that doesn't have one. Creoles often possess grammatical features that do not occur in the parent languages of the pidgin; the children of pidgin speakers are presumably the source of these innovations.Though there are many creoles, the transition from pidgin to creole has rarely, if ever, been captured in real time, though it has been reconstructed to some extent by interviewing older people. The Nicaraguan children are a living laboratory of language generation. Dr. Senghas, who has been visiting their school every year since 1990, said she had noticed how the signs for numbers have developed. Originally the children represented \"20\" by flicking the fingers of both hands in the air twice. But this cumbersome sign has been replaced with a form that can now be signed with one hand. The children don't care that the new sign doesn't look like a 20, Dr. Senghas said; they just want a symbol that can be signed fast."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/16/nyregion/movies/new-jersey-theaters-to-use-caption-devices-for-deaf.html", "headline": "New Jersey Theaters to Use Caption Devices for Deaf", "date": "2004-09-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Correction AppendedNEWARK, Sept. 16 - Four of the largest movie theater chains operating in New Jersey have agreed to install captioning devices for deaf and hearing-impaired patrons, the state attorney general's office announced on Wednesday. But the office said a lawsuit was filed against another theater chain, Regal Cinemas, after efforts to reach an agreement on installation of similar devices failed.Only three screens in three separate theaters, all of them in North Jersey, currently have the captioning devices, said Frank Vespa-Papaleo, director of the State Division on Civil Rights.Under the agreement, the theaters will use a technology called Rear Window in which deaf patrons receive a plexiglass device they can place in cup holders that will display reflected captions. Other customers cannot see the captions.The theater chains that settled were American Multi-Cinema, of Kansas City, Mo.; Clearview Cinemas, owned by Cablevision, of Bethpage, N.Y.; Loews Cineplex Theaters, of New York; and National Amusements, of Dedham, Mass. Mr. Vespa-Papaleo said the settlements were needed to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.Mr. Vespa-Papaleo said 39 screens at 34 theaters would feature the technology. The theaters, which have already begun ordering and installing the technology, must have the systems operating within 90 days.\"When children cannot go to watch films that the rest of us can watch, it emphasizes their otherness,\" Attorney General Peter C. Harvey said. \"It makes them feel like they are outsiders. We are going to make sure that New Jersey is open to people who are deaf and hard of hearing.\"About 720,000 deaf and hearing-impaired people live in the state, he said.The lawsuit against Regal Cinemas, which operates 152 screens in 12 theaters in the state, seeks immediate installation of captioning devices and unspecified damages. Mr. Harvey said Regal Cinemas had expressed concern with the cost of the technology, about $12,000 per screen.Regal Entertainment Group of Knoxville, Tenn., which operates Regal Cinemas, did not return several calls seeking comment on Wednesday.It was not immediately clear if other states had reached similar agreements with theater chains or how many screens in the country are equipped with captioning devices. There was no response to a message left with the National Association of Theater Owners.Under the settlement, theaters must also advertise in print and on the Internet to inform the public what theaters have the devices. They must also rotate first-run movies through their equipped theaters during prime theater times to ensure that deaf people have access to the same movies as other patrons.Theaters must also install listening devices for blind people, which are similar to books on tape, Mr. Vespa-Papaleo said. In addition to the dialogue, the device plays narrative about what is happening on screen.Mr. Harvey also announced that his office had begun work to ensure that hospitals across the state have staff members who can assist deaf or hearing-impaired patients in emergency rooms.Correction: September 22, 2004, Wednesday An article on Thursday about a settlement under which movie theaters in New Jersey agreed to use captioning devices for deaf patrons misidentified the law that the state said the theaters had been violating.

The plaintiffs were ages 4 to 18 at the time, specified in the lawsuit as 1944 to 1977, while they were students at the Boston School for the Deaf in Randolph, a suburb of Boston. The school, which was operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Boston, closed in 1994.The lawsuit, filed in Suffolk County Superior Court here, names 14 nuns, one priest, a staff member and Bishop Thomas V. Daily, the retired bishop of Brooklyn who had served in the Archdiocese of Boston, as defendants. It seeks unspecified monetary compensation.''They were supposed to receive an education,'' said the former students' lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, who added that he represented 22 more students willing to sue the defendants. ''Instead, they were sexually molested, physically abused and mentally tormented. They cannot hear. They cannot speak.''Mr. Garabedian said many of the students had their hands tied behind their backs for trying to use sign language, which was discouraged at the school in favor of oral communication.In a statement, the Sisters of St. Joseph said they would investigate the accusations, which they said they first heard on Tuesday.''We will proceed with sensitivity and dignity for the alleged abused and with a sincere reverence for the truth and respect for civil and canon law,'' the statement said. A lawyer for the order, William Shaevel, did not return calls for comment. A lawyer for Bishop Daily said the bishop had no comment.The suit is the first claiming extensive abuse by nuns since the scandal of sexual abuse by members of the clergy erupted here in early 2002. Mr. Garabedian represented hundreds of people who said they had been abused by John J. Geoghan, a defrocked priest who was killed in prison last year. The archdiocese reached an $85 million settlement last year with more than 500 people who said they had been abused by priests."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/12/sports/football-manning-and-colts-let-sign-language-do-the-talking.html", "headline": "Manning and Colts Let Sign Language Do the Talking", "date": "2004-01-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Whether crossing his wrists, slapping his legs or hitching his pants before the snap, Peyton Manning used his bevy of signals to serve as instruction to his teammates.''There are some dummy checks in there,'' Colts receiver Brandon Stokley said. ''But most of it means something.''Manning said, ''Yeah, we're pretty busy at the line of scrimmage.''In a divisional playoff game Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Colts' offense was busy all over the field. Manning and his offense found no Chiefs defender they feared, no Chiefs defensive scheme they could not shred. The Colts sliced the Chiefs' defense early, then left it splattered across the field late in a 38-31 victory before a stunned crowd of 79,159 at Arrowhead Stadium.Indianapolis (14-4) plays at New England (15-2) in the American Football Conference championship game on Sunday.The Colts' offense versus the Chiefs' defense was the story of this game. The Colts' offense could do little wrong and the Chiefs' defense could do little right. The Colts had eight possessions in the game and they went this way: Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, end of half, field goal, touchdown, touchdown and turnover on downs with eight seconds left. It was a mismatch that the Colts exploited to incredible heights, like pricking at an open wound despite seeing red.In this case, plenty of Chiefs red.The stadium was a colorful collage of Chiefs red and Colts white and blue, but the aftermath was stark and dark for the Chiefs.''It was very embarrassing,'' Chiefs cornerback Eric Warfield said. ''Hearing our fans start to boo us and not being able to stop them was disgraceful. They really hurt us on third down.''And first down, and second down, and . . .''It looked like Marvin and me and Edgerrin were doing everything, but those guys up front did the job,'' Manning said of receiver Marvin Harrison (98 receiving yards), running back Edgerrin James (125 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns) and his offensive line. Manning did plenty: 22 of 30 passing for 304 yards and 3 touchdowns.''He is the master,'' Chiefs defensive end Eric Hicks said. ''It's obvious why he's the co-M.V.P. of the league. That was an amazing performance.''Manning's maniacal hand gestures and other signals before the snap worked to perfection at a noisy stadium filled with the largest crowd for a Chiefs home playoff game.''Peyton is just playing phenomenal,'' Colts Coach Tony Dungy said. ''He's making the checks, putting us in the right plays and making the clutch third-down plays. He's just been fantastic the last two weeks. We're excited about going back to New England.''Actually, the Colts played the Patriots in Indianapolis on Nov. 30 and lost, 38-34. Chiefs Coach Dick Vermeil was asked if there was a defense that could stop the Colts.''I'm sure there are,'' Vermeil said. ''Maybe they're going to see one next week, I don't know. Going to New England is no easy place to play. But you go on the road and do what Tony's team did today to a team that has won 13 straight at home -- they've done a good job.''Rather than looking comfortable at home with their impressive 13-game winning streak here, rested after a first-round playoff bye and a 13-3 season, the Chiefs looked sapped on defense. Their offense produced plenty but dropped enough passes throughout, missed a first-half field goal and lost a fumble in the opening minutes of the third quarter that kept them from matching the Colts' offense.Consider that Chiefs running back Priest Holmes rushed for 176 yards and 2 touchdowns, that quarterback Trent Green threw for 212 yards and a touchdown, that the offensive line did not allow a sack, that the Chiefs gained 408 yards on offene and outscored the Colts, 21-17, in the second half. Chiefs kick returner Dante Hall added a dizzying 92-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the third quarter.But the Colts' offense was better. It was spurred by a sparkling 8 of 11 on third-down conversions; the Chiefs were only 5 of 11.''We know we have some flaws on defense, just like the Colts understand they have some flaws,'' Vermeil said. ''They're going on and we're not. We are aware that we have some problems -- all year -- but not as many problems as we had today.''A 17-play drive capped by Holmes's 1-yard run made it 38-31 with 4 minutes 22 seconds left, and nearly everyone at the stadium expected that the Chiefs would try an onside kick. Surely they would not give the ball back to the Colts and hope for a stop, but that is exactly what they did.The Colts took the ball at their 33 after the kickoff and moved it the way they had all game. They would run eight plays and leave only eight seconds remaining before giving the ball back to the Chiefs. A 13-yard pass to Holmes ended the game.Vermeil was asked why he did not try an onside kick.''We thought we'd get the ball back,'' he said. ''Hey, you never know. I did what I thought was right at the time.''With that defense? No chance.''Actually, with four minutes on the clock, I felt this would be the drive that the defense would stop them,'' Holmes said. ''Unfortunately, the Colts did a wonderful job checking out of certain plays and making sure that they were reading our safeties. Peyton Manning showed why he is still in the playoffs.''And, after a five-touchdown-pass performance against Denver in the first round of the playoffs last week, Manning remained hot.''The game got on the kind of pace where we knew if we could get a couple of stops, we could win the game because they weren't really going to stop us,'' Stokley said.James said: ''Everybody played their part. Everybody showed up. We had like a one-two punch going.''And the Chiefs' defense had the bruises afterward to show it."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/18/technology/for-the-deaf-communication-without-the-wait.html", "headline": "For the Deaf, Communication Without the Wait", "date": "2003-12-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "THE spread of high-speed Internet access and the increasing sophistication of videoconferencing tools have given the deaf broad new access to a simple pleasure that most people take for granted: chatting on the telephone. New products and services promise to liberate the deaf from the slow text-based telecommunications systems that have been their primary option for decades.One offering, a videophone and relay service introduced by Sorenson Media, enables users to sign with each other or with banks of interpreters who translate live phone conversations between the deaf and those who hear.The Sorenson videophone is a breakthrough, said Genie Gertz, an assistant professor of deaf studies at California State University at Northridge, because it enables the deaf to use what many consider to be their native language -- American Sign Language -- with unprecedented simplicity and clarity. ''This is a gigantic step for the deaf community,'' Ms. Gertz, who is deaf, said through an interpreter.The Sorenson VP-100 is a stand-alone videophone that works with a television and broadband Internet connection. It has a remote control and a flashing light that can be used instead of a ringer to signal incoming calls. Users can sign directly with another deaf person or with a Sorenson interpreter. Because of the high quality of the video, the interpreter can read the deaf user's signing while simultaneously translating and speaking to the telephone user, and vice versa.Ms. Gertz, who was born deaf, said the videophone was vastly superior to the text-based relay services the deaf have used for years. In those systems, known as TTY or TDD, deaf users type and see text on devices connected to a phone line; both the deaf person and telephone user must wait to take turns communicating through an operator. Much is lost in the translation, especially emotions. ''It is extraordinarily impersonal,'' Ms. Gertz said.By contrast, she said, the videophone enables her to express herself; equally important, it allows her to read the emotions of the interpreter acting on behalf of the other person. Conversing with her Russian-born parents, who are not fully fluent in English, always posed special difficulties with the text-based systems. With the videophone, Ms. Gertz can now grasp the facial expressions and body language of interpreters quickly and clearly enough that she can help them to understand her parents' accent.From the telephone user's perspective, the relay service is nearly seamless. A conversation with Ms. Gertz occurred naturally and with few pauses, and the interpreter added vocal inflexion and tone in a way that conveyed emotion and created a connection.''Everything is live, and that's the key,'' Ms. Gertz said. ''People feel very much more as though they are talking to just any other person on the phone.''The Sorenson videophone, introduced in April, has spread to 40 college campuses, including Ohlone College in Fremont, Calif., which has one of the largest populations of deaf students in the country. Ohlone has set up 11 videophone stations using a new high-speed Internet connection and televisions with 12-inch screens.Ronald Burdett, dean of deaf studies at Ohlone, said the videophone breaks down communication barriers that still exist with TTY systems. ''It's a way for deaf people to have equal access to the same sorts of communications that hearing people have,'' Mr. Burdett, who is deaf, said through an interpreter.Sorenson Media, the company behind the videophone and relay service, is known mainly for software that compresses video so it can travel quickly across the Internet.The company, based in Salt Lake City, decided a year ago that with broadband Internet access becoming widely available in homes, it was time to bring a videophone to the deaf. ''We happen to be a company right in the nexus of all of this,'' said James Lee Sorenson, the chief executive.Since the videophone was introduced last spring and the relay service was approved by the Federal Communications Commission, the company has added new relay centers -- there are now three -- as the volume of calls has grown.The company provides the phones and relay service at no cost to deaf users, and Mr. Sorenson estimated that 20,000 to 30,000 calls a month were completed using the system. More information is available at www.sorensonvrs.com.In addition to the Sorenson VP-100, several other video relay services have become available over the last 18 months. Those systems, which combine PC's with Web cameras, enable deaf people to use programs like Microsoft's NetMeeting to sign with interpreters who relay with telephone users. Telephone carriers like AT&T (www.att.com/relay) and Sprint (www.sprintvrs.com) as well as other companies like Hands On Video Relay Services (www.hovrs.com) offer such services.Sprint's service allows customers to use the D-Link i2eye videophone ($199 at www.dlink.com), which also works with a TV and requires a high-speed Internet connection. It offers the same quality of video as the Sorenson VP-100, though it lacks the deaf-specific interface.Both Ms. Gertz and Mr. Burdett prefer the Sorenson videophone to PC-based Webcam systems because the screen is larger and the picture is clearer. ''It is absolutely amazing the kind of quality that you can get,'' Mr. Burdett said. Moreover, because the videophone is a stand-alone device that works with a television instead of a computer, it can be simpler to use. ''Web cameras can be very complex to set up,'' he added.While videophones have big advantages, not everyone in the deaf community is ready to push aside their Webcams. New PC-based videoconferencing technology has have also yielded new products for the deaf. A new for-profit Web site, www.clubdeaf.com, uses technology from SightSpeed (www.sightspeed.com) that enables users to easily initiate videoconferencing sessions and to sign with each other. The SightSpeed technology, developed from research at Cornell University, produces the high-quality video that is essential for sign language. Moreover, because SightSpeed can run inside a Web browser, it simplifies the setup procedures for users.Tayler Mayer, a Web site designer who attends Gallaudet University in Washington, is helping with the ClubDeaf.com site design. Mr. Mayer, who is also deaf, said the site was designed to take advantage of the quality of the video and was simple to navigate. ''It has everything already set up for you,'' he said through an interpreter. ''You just go in and you sign on.''After a free testing period that ends in January, users who want to join ClubDeaf.com will be charged a monthly fee that has not yet been set for unlimited videoconferencing.Apart from the spread of high-speed Internet access, the more powerful processors inside desktop PC's are allowing companies to deliver improved videoconferencing products. To send video across the Internet, each frame must be compressed, then ''unpacked'' on the receiving end. Companies like SightSpeed are developing more efficient compression algorithms that exploit the computing power of those new processors. The result is better and more affordable Internet-based videoconferencing. ''All of this stuff is getting awfully good, and it's getting cheap,'' said V.Michael Bove, a research scientist at M.I.T.'s Media Lab.Advances in videoconferencing have the potential to revolutionize telecommunications for the deaf, many advocates say. Ms. Gertz said that trained interpreters would remain necessary, but her enthusiasm for the Sorenson videophone and relay system is apparent. ''This technology is the best thing that has happened to the deaf community,'' she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/20/nyregion/praying-hands-wringing-hands-deaf-congregation-on-east-side-fears-for-its-future.html", "headline": "Praying Hands, Wringing Hands; Deaf Congregation on East Side Fears for Its Future", "date": "2003-11-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "The hands are flying above the pews, middle fingers rapidly touching palms to signify the wounds, and the name, of Jesus.

Palms finally close together: Amen.The dialogue between priest and parishioners is vibrant during Mass at St. Elizabeth of Hungary, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. But it is largely silent. St. Elizabeth's is the official home of deaf Roman Catholics in the Archdiocese of New York.These days, a current of worry runs beneath the quiet. Attendance at St. Elizabeth's, which also has a hearing congregation, is anemic. And the church, on 83rd Street near Third Avenue, lies within walking distance of a half-dozen other Catholic churches. These are ominous signs as the archdiocese begins work on a sweeping plan to reorganize parishes -- possibly closing some -- and redeploy a dwindling number of priests.''The question is, where will the deaf go?'' Msgr. Patrick P. McCahill, the pastor, said in a recent interview before Sunday Mass. ''They would not have the same sense of belonging, of ownership, that they feel here.''In its reorganization, the archdiocese is looking closely at churches that fall below the average for their geographical area in four categories: baptisms, average weekend Mass attendance, average daily Mass attendance and enrollment in religious education classes. St. Elizabeth's lags considerably on all four counts.For the year ended June 2002, the most recent statistics available, it recorded 12 baptisms, an average of 225 Massgoers on weekends and 15 on weekdays and 66 children enrolled in religious education classes. But the archdiocese says it will take many other factors into account, including the kind of special mission that St. Elizabeth's fulfills.Bishop Timothy A. McDonnell, who is guiding the reorganization, has promised that the deaf ministry will survive, though he said he could not guarantee where.''It's a fantastic program they have there, a service to the community of the hearing impaired,'' he said. But it is far too early, he said, to predict what will happen to St. Elizabeth's, adding, ''That's like trying to give a Ph.D. to a newborn.''The fears have worked their way throughout deaf circles in the region. Sister Joan Finn, coordinator of deaf services for the Diocese of Rockville Centre, on Long Island, said she had heard rumors that St. Elizabeth's might close. She said Monsignor McCahill, who also celebrates regular Masses for the deaf in White Plains and on Staten Island, had made St. Elizabeth's a well-known haven for the deaf. ''It's almost heartbreaking to think it may cease to be,'' she said.St. Elizabeth's was established in 1891 on the Lower East Side for Slovak Catholics, and in 1918 moved to its present sanctuary at East 83rd Street, which had been founded, also in 1891, as a Lutheran church.In 1980, Cardinal Terence Cooke designated the church the official home for deaf Catholics at the request of Monsignor McCahill, who had been looking for a base for them. It became a favorite of Cardinal Cooke's successor, Cardinal John O'Connor, who spoke of it fondly and came once a year to celebrate Mass.Cardinal O'Connor also supported the establishment of a small program for deaf seminarians at the archdiocesan seminary, St. Joseph's in Yonkers.But after the seminary rector, Bishop Edwin F. O'Brien, left to become archbishop of the military and within weeks of the cardinal's death in 2000, the program was shut down. For current seminary officials, the program was a noble but failed experiment because St Joseph's was ill-equipped to properly train deaf seminarians; advocates for the deaf, however, say the faculty and administration showed a lack of will.With the cardinal's death and the rector's departure, Monsignor McCahill said, ''We lost all our friends.''Today, about a dozen churches cater to the deaf in the archdiocese, which covers Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx and seven counties to the north, and the Diocese of Brooklyn, which includes Queens. But most simply provide interpreters at a monthly service; only one priest besides Monsignor McCahill celebrates Mass in sign language, the Rev. Frank Damis of St. Joseph Church in Kingston, and only once a month.Deaf Catholics say the interpreted Masses are far less meaningful than services led by a signing priest. At interpreted Masses, ''their vision is split,'' said Sister Janet Marchesani, coordinator of deaf services for the archdiocese's northern counties. ''The language itself, coming from the priest celebrant, is so much more meaningful.''Before a recent signed Mass at St. Elizabeth's, the deaf parishioners gathered in the church hall. Monsignor McCahill flickered the lights to signal that it was time to go upstairs and begin. Eventually, about 40 worshipers filled the pews.The lights were turned up high to make it easier to see the monsignor's signing. Often, parishioners said, churches that provide interpreters do not think of that.Rather than consecrating the wine and bread as he held them up, the monsignor signed the words first, with unoccupied hands. At interpreted Masses, deaf worshipers are often left standing at the end of the Gospel, when congregants normally sit down, while an interpreter catches up with the reader; but here, no one had to suffer that awkwardness. A young man in a do-rag took up the collection. Another parishioner, Min Seo Park, gave a reading, in sign language. (Some days, a deaf choir signs out hymns.)Throughout, the monsignor provided a spoken version of the Mass for the few hearing parishioners present and for hearing children of the deaf, although technically, only the spoken version is official because the Vatican has not sanctioned a liturgy in sign language.During the homily, his signing grew more animated and his voice fainter, unable to quite keep pace as he poured eloquence into his hands. After signing the Lord's Prayer, taking holy communion and receiving the monsignor's blessing, the congregation left for cake and coffee in the community hall next door.There, various groups meet during the week, like the Puerto Rican Society for the Catholic Deaf, the Black Deaf Advocates, a chapter of the International Catholic Deaf Association and the National Fraternal Association of the Deaf. But on Sundays, the real draw is the monsignor. ''St. Elizabeth's is very important for the deaf because Father can do sign language,'' signed Alex Taccogna, 71, a retired garment-machine operator, with Monsignor McCahill interpreting. ''The children can learn their religion here.''Mr. Park, 35, was one of the seminarians in the program at St. Joseph's. He is now a student at St. John's University and is still hoping to become a priest, for the Archdiocese of Seoul. ''The hearing priest does not understand deaf culture,'' said Mr. Park, who collected signatures and wrote to the archdiocese with his worries about St. Elizabeth's fate. ''It's just different. You, Father McCahill, you understand the deaf culture.''Monsignor McCahill, 60, who is director of the archdiocese's services for the deaf, said he stumbled into his role. While a student at St. Joseph's Seminary, he began studying sign language to eat up empty Saturday afternoons. After ordination, he became assistant to the previous minister to the deaf, Msgr. Walter Darcy, at St. Jude Church in Inwood. In 1980, Monsignor McCahill moved to St. Elizabeth's.He said he wondered what would happen to his congregation when he left, either to retire or be transferred. ''I would love, and that was always the goal, to be replaced by a deaf person,'' he said. ''The whole missionary thing -- you get native clergy and the missionaries step away, and that's the way it should be.''Right now that seems unlikely. The priest said he was counting on members of the deaf Catholic world taking on more duties in the church. ''Deaf people have a very strong community all on their own,'' he said. ''They have taught me more about community than anything else or any other situation I've been in.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/22/us/ups-settles-bias-lawsuit-brought-by-deaf-workers.html", "headline": "U.P.S.

He said that over 10 years the company never provided a qualified interpreter for any other training.Peggy Gardner, a U.P.S. spokeswoman, said, ''The measures called for in the settlement will make what we believe is one of the best working environments even better.''In settling, she said, the company was not admitting to having a discriminatory working environment. She said that the settlement made sense for the company because the trial was expected to last many more months.U.P.S. agreed that company officials would meet at least three times a year with each deaf employee to address work concerns.

It is also a prime mover within the New Partnership for Africa's Development, or NEPAD, one of the more hopeful initiatives that has emerged from this troubled continent.The view from Algiers should therefore be important to those who claim to have Africa's interests at heart. Unfortunately, none of the Western powers with major stakes in Africa seem to be listening.With its painful colonial past, Algeria does not much like or trust the return of the former colonial powers to Africa in military interventions, such as the French-led operation to protect civilians in Bunia, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Meanwhile, the United States, to which many African governments look for leadership, has engaged with African security problems only gingerly since the Somalia debacle in 1993. The much-hyped AIDS initiative (still not fully funded by Congress) and the slightly increased economic aid program (ditto) fail to dispel the impression that Washington prefers to leave both leadership and risks in Africa to London and Paris.The small but well-equipped French-led \"coalition of the willing\" in Bunia \u2014 where the UN's under-powered peacekeeping operation, MONUC, had been overwhelmed by ethnic violence that broke out in the wake of Uganda's military withdrawal from the area \u2014 has provoked much self-congratulation among participating countries. But the lamentable fate of Bunia raises two serious questions.First, how is it that after years of effort to end the civil war in the Congo, most of the parties to the war have been engaged in continuous mischief while paying lip service to South Africa's diplomatic efforts to end the killing? Ultimately, if the many parties to this conflict remain more interested in plunder and personal vendettas than in the plight of civilian populations, there will be little the outside world can do to help.The second key question is why the countries of the industrialized world failed to participate meaningfully in MONUC when it deployed in 1999. That France and others should fly to its rescue only days before the Group of Eight summit meeting in Evian, France, surprises few in Africa. Nobody here believes that a three-month deployment (the coalition is scheduled to withdraw in early September) will do more than induce the killers to wait out this faint-hearted Western effort before the slaughter resumes.Leading NEPAD countries such as South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria and Senegal have been trying to promote more effective African institutions and decisions, including on democracy and the rule of law, amid evidence that the African Union, successor to the Organization of African Unity, remains pitifully weak and prey to cynical accommodations among its member states.However, murderous conflicts continue to afflict the continent. The embattled Liberian president and indicted war criminal, Charles Taylor, serves to remind that West Africa, from the Ivory Coast to Guinea-Bissau, is now a theater for continuous, interlocking fighting. France's military intervention in the Ivory Coast has helped freeze military skirmishing there, but has done little to resolve the tensions stoked by irresponsible and self-interested Ivorian politicians. President Robert Mugabe's fierce repression of Zimbabwe's opposition \u2014 unimpeded by neighboring states \u2014 shames Africa as a whole.NEPAD rests on an exchange of increased Western assistance for improved governance in African countries. Progress on the latter, while clear, is slow and uneven. But Western countries, while announcing increased aid and providing the occasional military Band-Aid, are holding up more significant engagement until the Africans do more to help themselves.African leaders, particularly NEPAD's core proponents, need to intensify their efforts to tackle African wars and challenges to democracy. Western capitals need to move beyond mediagenic interventions and diplomatic gestures to support UN and African conflict-resolution efforts. Their performance to date can only inspire deep skepticism among Africans.*The writer, a former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, is president of the International Peace Academy in New York.[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/10/international/europe/28-boys-die-in-fire-at-school-for-deaf-in-russia.html", "headline": "28 Boys Die in Fire at School for Deaf in Russia", "date": "2003-04-10T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": " MOSCOW, April 10 \u2014 Asleep and unable to hear the frantic shouts of adults, 28 deaf boys perished early today after fire consumed their boarding school in the Caspian Sea city of Makhachkala, in Russia's Dagestan province. At least 106 others were injured, 22 of them critically.  It was the second major school fire in four days, following a blaze in Siberia which killed 22 children in a gymnasium dressing room, and it left average Russians stunned and enraged over the perilous state of poorly maintained school buildings.  \"All Russians are grieving,\" President Vladimir V. Putin said today. \"These were our children. It is our tragedy.\"  Dagestan officials said the fire, which may have stemmed from electrical problems, broke out about 2:20 a.m. in the two-story school, which housed 159 boys between ages seven or eight and 14 in a dormitory on its second floor.  Only about 25 children escaped unscathed, some by jumping out second-story windows, the RTR television network reported.  Teachers struggled for several minutes to awaken children from slumber before giving up and summoning firemen, who were unable to control a fire that was whipped by gale-force winds. Within two and one-half hours, the building had burned virtually to the ground, the Interfax news service reported.  A nearby resident who helped battle the fire told Agence France-Presse that many children were missed during the evacuation because they were out of sight, cowering under their beds.  Firefighters were hampered because one pumper arrived without water and because they had no ladders tall enough to reach the second floor, the neighbor was quoted as saying, but that report could not be independently confirmed.  Officials said most of the children probably died from smoke inhalation. The injured suffered from smoke inhalation, burns and carbon monoxide poisoning.  Russia's chief prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into the tragedy, but investigators said that the most likely cause of the fire was damaged electrical wiring or a short circuit, perhaps related to high winds which had blown down power lines and caused an electrical outage earlier in the evening.  This morning's fire was the second major disaster involving children to strike this southwest Russian province in 11 months. Almost exactly 11 months ago, a bomb filled with shrapnel exploded in Kaspiisk, just a few miles south of Makhachkala, during a parade marking the end of World War II. At least 41 people, 17 of them schoolchildren, died in the blast, which was blamed on anti-government guerrillas.  In Dagestan, the regional government declared a day of mourning on Friday, when all the dead are to be buried. Some officials said the toll still could rise because a number of surviving children were seriously burned.  The regional government said it would give 100,000 rubles, or about $3,200, to each family of a dead child, and half that to each surviving child. Legislators in the local parliament and many other government workers were contributing a day's pay to a fund for the victims, news services reported.  The federal government this morning ordered a plane filled with medicine, equipment and experts from the Catastrophe Medical Center and the Moscow City Children's Hospital flown to Makhachkala.  Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov demanded that safety standards be stiffened in schools, saying fires like the two this week had become \"a systemic problem\" in Russia's vast state-run and badly underfinanced education system.  Today, the Russian government's emergencies ministry said that it would work with the education ministry to upgrade fire-safety equipment and procedures at schools across the country. The acting head of the emergencies ministry's fire safety office, Maj. Gen. Vyacheslav Mulishkin, told Interfax that the lack of fire extinguishers and alarms were a major problem and that school spending on fire safety should be increased.  \"There will be no additional inspections for fire safety at schools, as all the violations are already known,\" he was quoted as saying.

Workers", "date": "2003-04-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Lawyers for 900 deaf workers at United Parcel Service argued today as a trial in their discrimination lawsuit opened that the company had excluded them from numerous job categories and generally limited them to bottom-rung positions.Advocates for the disabled say they hope the class-action suit, one of the largest involving deaf plaintiffs, will set a precedent that will require companies across the nation to do more to accommodate and promote deaf employees.In the trial, lawyers for the 900 current and former employees say they plan to provide evidence that U.P.S. often does not provide deaf workers with interpreters during safety training and other meetings and has not promoted a deaf employee to management in five years.At a news conference outside the federal courthouse, one deaf Bay Area employee, Babaranti Oloyede, said today that he was unable to understand training about anthrax because the company did not provide an interpreter.Todd Schneider, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said, ''Deaf people will not and cannot tolerate unequal treatment in the workplace.''U.P.S. officials say that their company, with one of the nation's largest work forces, is being unfairly accused of discrimination and that it has been far more aggressive than many other companies in employing deaf workers.''As this case unfolds, our commitment to providing opportunity and fairness for hearing-impaired employees will become clear,'' said Malcolm Berkeley, a spokesman for the company, which is based in Atlanta. ''The claims made by the plaintiffs are distorted and give an inaccurate picture of U.P.S.''Contending that U.P.S. has a glass ceiling for deaf workers, Larry Paradis, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that it was not enough for a company to hire a large number of disabled workers.''It's a shameful defense to say that deaf people are entitled to nothing more than an entry-level job,'' Mr. Paradis said.Mr. Paradis, who works for Disability Rights Advocates, said the case would last at least a month, partly because the plaintiffs plan to call more than 30 deaf employees as witnesses as well as several managers who they say will shed light on the company's failure to accommodate its deaf workers.After today's trial session ended, several deaf workers joined the lawyers in detailing their complaints about the company.''My first experience was discrimination,'' Bert Enos, a former package loader, said with the help of an interpreter. ''They said they would provide an interpreter at safety meetings, and the next day there were no interpreters.''Several deaf workers said the company barred them from driving any of its trucks, even though Federal Express and the Postal Service allow deaf employees to drive their vehicles.Deaf workers also said that they were often shown training videos without captions, that important pre-shift meetings were usually held without interpreters and that there were emergency building evacuations without deaf workers being properly informed.Mr. Paradis said U.P.S., on the eve of the trial, had begun doing more to accommodate deaf workers. He said that was tantamount to an admission of guilt. But Mr. Berkeley said the company had a better record than most companies in hiring and accommodating the deaf as well as other disabled workers.''For years, we've been committed to hiring, promoting and providing accommodation for people with disabilities,'' Mr. Berkeley said. ''We have a strong record of providing opportunities for the hearing impaired and others with disabilities.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/17/opinion/IHT-1903deaf-people-can-hear-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html", "headline": "1903:Deaf People Can Hear : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO", "date": "2003-03-17T05:00:00+0000", "source": "International Herald Tribune", "text": "NEW YORK: It was successfully demonstrated that, by the aid of an electrical invention of Miller Hutchinson, it becomes possible for deaf-mutes to hear.

A fine counterculture event (oh, sorry, in those days, that would have been your culture), featuring, over the years, poets and performers like Allen Ginsberg, Patti Smith, Gregory Corso, William S. Burroughs, John Cage and Lou Reed. In the 1970's, the reading began at 7 at night and ran until 3 or 4 in the morning.Today, while artists like Ms. Smith, Eric Bogosian, Philip Glass and Taylor Meade are scheduled to perform, the reading is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. and run till around midnight.A bow to our more somber mood, says Ed Friedman, the artistic director of the Poetry Project and himself a poet. Mr. Friedman, it does not seem irrelevant to note, is 52. And he has gone gray.''Everyone is working,'' he sighs. ''And for a lot of people that are maybe over 35 -- well, put it this way: Getting people to come out and read at 3 a.m. isn't what it once was.''Can you be saying, Mr. Friedman, that Bohemia isn't what it used to be?''It's harder,'' he says. ''It's harder than it used to be in the 1970's. Poets could pretty much support themselves with a part-time job. And there was a lot more time to write. Poets and pretty much everybody have to work much harder now, to assume the work of people who are fired. It used to be you had time at your desk that you weren't doing anything, you could write a poem, call a friend, use the copy machine.''A nurturing spot for creative types, St. Mark's Church, and if you doubt it, try to find a quiet spot to interview Mr. Friedman. The sanctuary of the church has an exhibit of ceramic face masks, about to come down, and if you ask that the installation be delayed for 10 minutes while a photographer shoots, the ceramics artist, feeling particularly disenfranchised, sulks.''Yeah, I'm just the artist,'' he says.Discussion on the second-floor balcony is accompanied by the sounds of a piano tuner, and the ringing of the church bells, a few feet away. It is a credit to Mr. Friedman, an easygoing, amusing man, that in this environment he can discuss Art. Particularly as his poems are not the ''How do I love thee'' sort.They are free form, often written as text, and may include references to the process of writing, so that if the poet coughs, the poem includes the words, ''big cough,'' or ''My throat is dry and full of mucus.''BLONGGGG! (Short pause.) BLONGGGG, BLONGGGG, BLONGGGG! (That was a reference to the piano tuner, concentrating on the lower end of the keyboard. He certainly is dedicated. Doesn't he ever go to the bathroom? Moreover, if those bells peal one more time the reporter will leap over the balcony.)''I am isolated bourgeoisie/who would gladly write for the masses/if only I knew them as friends and co-workers,'' Mr. Friedman begins one poem. ''We'd talk about families and then make plans/to renovate the world that's crushed us for generations.''A bit of poetic license there, perhaps, for the world, as Mr. Friedman tells it, did not, in the early days, crush him. He grew up in Los Angeles, his father a doctor, his mother a bacteriologist turned sculptor. There was a year and a half of pre-med at the University of California at San Diego, before graduating with a degree in poetry and literature. His parents were not enchanted with his decision to be a poet, but it was the 60's, Mr. Friedman says with a laugh, when there existed this strange idea that you could be what you wanted.He came to New York in the fall of 1971 and was involved in poetry readings at St. Mark's Church, at 131 East 10th Street, by January 1972. Now he earns $40,000 a year at the Poetry Project. He is married to a painter who works in textile design, he has a 3-year-old son. Things have not always been good.More from his autobiographical poem, ''Isolated Bourgeoisie'':''The day is cold. The sky is blue and cloud-strewn,/my wife is recovering from alcoholism, and/we're going to Washington to protest even one more/cent being allocated for stupid B-1 bombers instead of schools./Would you like to come? I know there's room on the/yellow bus we're borrowing from the/neighborhood vehicle cooperative.''BLONGGG! (The piano tuner.)CLANG, CLANG, CLANG! (The reverberating church bells. Ears hurt. Must get out. How to ask the rude question?)MR. FRIEDMAN, your nine volumes of poetry have been published in the smallest of the small press. It would appear that you are not so successful.''Look at Allen Ginsberg,'' Mr. Friedman says. ''Who published him? City Lights, who did Gregory Corso, Lawrence Ferlinghetti. It hasn't been the major houses or major university press that has spawned influential work over the last hundred years.''But there was a point when Ginsberg was published by larger houses.''In the last 20 years of his life,'' Mr. Friedman says.If that's correct, shouldn't Mr. Friedman, by this time in his life, be getting published in the larger houses now, too?''Gee, I hope so,'' Mr. Friedman says.Then grins.(Nice guy. Sweet.)"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/26/nyregion/the-neediest-cases-deaf-immigrant-puts-his-heart-into-love-and-work.html", "headline": "The Neediest Cases; Deaf Immigrant Puts His Heart Into Love and Work", "date": "2002-11-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from November 26, 2002, Section B, Page 4Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Jin Luo has taught without hearing the chatter of children. He has cooked without hearing the bubble of slow-boiling water or the sound of a knife blade against a chopping block. He has repaired boat engines without hearing them catch and doesn't know the ticking of passing seconds from the watches he has fixed.Since an accident when he was a boy in China, he has lived in a world of near total silence. At the Pathmark on Farrington Street in Flushing, Queens, where he works as a baker, just about the only sound that slips past his ruined inner ears is the jarring buzzer of the oven timer.But Mr. Luo, 42, has never let his disability keep him from pursuing love, a new home in a new land, an honest living and the dream of a better life. It has taught him how to be as self-sufficient as possible, and how to seek out agencies like the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven local charities that benefit from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, when he needs a little help.Mr. Luo grew up in Taishan, in Guangdong Province, China. When he was 5 years old, he fell off a ledge where he was playing.''I burst my skull,'' Mr. Luo said, speaking in American Sign Language through an interpreter, Emma Mio, a caseworker at the Brooklyn Bureau. ''I burst my eardrums. They thought I was dead.''Mr. Luo could communicate only by writing on a pad of paper. So when he was 9, his mother enrolled him at the Taishan School for the Deaf, where he learned how to sign in Chinese. He also met a little girl, Xing, who would one day become his wife.In 1985, Xing and her parents moved to the United States. She and Mr. Luo were in love, so they planned to marry and to reunite in America.For seven years, Xing worked as a seamstress to save the money to bring Mr. Luo to New York. In the meantime, ''We wrote letters every week,'' he said.Mr. Luo worked at whatever jobs he could find in China, guided by necessity and his natural curiosity. He was a substitute math teacher for deaf children, a cafeteria cook, a rice paddy farmer, an electrician, a boat repairman and a watch repairman.Xing made a brief visit to China in 1992, and the couple married. She returned to New York and continued saving money for her husband's trip. When Mr. Luo finally came to the United States in 1997, he had not seen his wife in five years.''She met me at the airport at night,'' Mr. Luo said. ''I was excited to see her.''Now he shares the 350-square-foot apartment in Astoria where his wife, her brother and their parents have lived since arriving in the United States. Mr. Luo's first job was in Queens, sewing at a textile company where his wife worked.But Mr. Luo had higher aspirations. He wanted to earn more so he and his wife could move into an apartment of their own. Over three months, he saved $150 so he could take classes in American Sign Language and English at La Guardia Community College in Long Island City.A counselor at the college told Mr. Luo about an office of the New York State Education Department that assists students with disabilities. There, he was referred to the Brooklyn Bureau.''Every time he comes to my office he's well dressed,'' said Ms. Mio, who has been helping Mr. Luo since August. ''He's very professional, very polite. He looks like he's going for a job interview.''Mr. Luo enrolled last year in a course at the bureau that teaches people with disabilities how to stock shelves and work in basic food preparation. The program is partly financed by money from the Neediest Cases Fund.People usually take six weeks to complete the course, Ms. Mio said, but Mr. Luo finished in three.The bureau placed him at Pathmark, where he works eight hours a day, five days a week, and earns $7 an hour. Ms. Mio sees him twice a month and receives evaluations from his supervisor.Mr. Luo would like to be a chef eventually and cook Chinese food at a hotel. But right now, he is focusing on an apartment. Since he cannot afford brokers' fees and would be able to spend only about $300 a month, the bureau is trying to help.Last week, the bureau used $1,000 from the Neediest fund to buy a new full-size bed and mattress, along with sheets and blankets, for Mr. Luo and his wife. Their old mattress was a twin handed down through three generations.Mrs. Luo, 40, recently lost her job when the textile company closed, so Mr. Luo is grateful to be working. And his manager, Steven Rosario, is happy to have him on the job. His promptness and efficiency have made him a valuable asset over the past year, Mr. Rosario said.''When Jin does the work,'' he said, ''I don't even have to look.''''I've been trying to get him a raise for the past six months,'' Mr. Rosario added. ''Jin Luo is the man. I always tell him that.''Mr. Luo just laughed.HOW TO HELPChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245, or any of these organizations:BROOKLYN BUREAU OF COMMUNITY SERVICE285 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217.CATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK1011 First Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022.CATHOLIC CHARITIES, DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS191 Joralemon Street, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201.CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY105 East 22d Street, New York, N.Y. 10010.COMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK105 East 22d Street, New York, N.Y. 10010.FEDERATION OF PROTESTANT WELFARE AGENCIES281 Park Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10010.UJA-FEDERATION OF NEW YORKChurch Street Station P.O.

'Signs' Language: A Forum Feud  Not since \"Fight Club\" and \"Magnolia\" have the regulars in the Movies forums been so polarized by a current release. Though a Mel Gibson movie about aliens might seem like an unlikely candidate for division, participants have argued about the religiousness of the movie's message, whether the plot makes any sense and whether the movie is \"the first Jungian sci-fi film\" or \"silly, preposterous and inept.\" A selection of opinions:  Nilson2001 : \"M. Night Shyamalan is sly, rather like Hitchcock, in giving you suspense and the paranormal with a wink and a wry smile from time to time. Indeed, much of the edgy humor in the film struck me as Hitchcockian. Humorous nods to 'War of the Worlds' and 'Blair Witch' will also not disappoint. Way exceeded my expectations, perhaps because 'Signs' is more about a man's twisted psyche than it is about flattened hieroglyphs in corn.\"  McBain2 : \"'Signs' is just ahead of 'Spider-Man' as the best film of the year. A perfect evolution of Hitchcock and Spielberg. It isn't as good as 'Unbreakable' but every bit as good as 'The Sixth Sense.' It is terrifying and touching, 'The Birds' meets 'Close Encounters.'\"  Hippiemc : \"What a wretched film.\"  OilCanBoyd23 : \"So it's \"Jungian\" (whatever that is) in that it's so bad it sends us back to the primordial soup?\"  Claxton6 : \"I enjoyed the movie on the most literal level, for the same reason that I enjoyed 'Unbreakable': Shyamalan took what for anyone else would have been a bombastic, 'epic' story, and reduced it to a very small, quiet scale. (Not to deny that MNS had his pretensions; certainly they were, I just found them easy to ignore.) ... He reduced the jingoistic bombast of 'Independence Day' down to 'Signs.' I am willing to forgive Shyamalan all of his mysticism and pretensions as long as he keeps doing it. \"  Chris563 : \"'Unbreakable' was forgettably stupid to me, but 'Signs' ranks him with the pathetics. This movie reeked stankily in every way, and was at best a callous rip-off of a truly great trapped-in-a-Pennsylvania-farmhouse-horror movie, George A. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead.'\"  KeJones4 : \"I don't think you can count what was represented in 'Signs' as religion. Shymaylan may have meant it that way, but it was so vague as to be incomprehensible. I mean, if you think 'life has purpose' - which is about how deep they got in this thing - is religious propaganda, then you must set the bar for propaganda pretty low or have a pretty poor understanding of religion.'\"  Billyweeds : \"The message is things don't happen by pure chance - that there is a higher power watching over us. This message is clear in the fatal accident to Graham's wife, in the crop circles, in Morgan's asthma, in almost literally everything that happens. There are NO coincidences, no accidents. It's a positive message, not assaultive, and rubs some cynics the wrong way, to put it mildly. I found it beautiful and moving, demonstrated through thrills and humor, and as a result I found 'Signs' one of the best movies in at least ten years.\"  Join the Current Film Forum  The Indian Model  In his Aug. 14 column \"Where Freedom Reigns\" , Thomas L. Friedman wrote that India should be looked to as the model for democracy for a country with a large Muslim population. Members of the Friedman forum agreed. Here are two responses to the column:  VRSonti : \"You are 100% right.  \"I write as a U.S. citizen of Indian origin (Hindu-Brahmin, but 100% Gandhian in religion - intermarried with Outcastes and Muslims) who was hounded out of the country by the precursors of the present terrorists in power. They won by appealing to the vilest instincts of the Indian soul, and are still at it. It is the ruling party in India today - who is the biggest bunch of terrorists I know. And I am sure you know it, too.  \"Most Indians - like the people in Bangalore you met - are fed up with Politics. They want Peace and an End to bloodshed and violence. One hopes the U.S. will rise to the occasion. But thank you for your support!\"  Shubh4 : \"Tom Friedman's latest column is very important not only for its championing of democracy as a mechanism for peace in the Muslim world, it is also a reminder to secular Indians that they have come far but have still farther to go.  \"Mr. Friedman refers to violent Hindu-Muslim clashes in Gujarat earlier this year. Hundreds, possibly even more than a thousand, people were killed. The free press and Indians worldwide spoke out against the horror and the mayhem did not spread.  \"Secularism buys us enormous strategic clout in the world. When Tom Friedman writes admiringly of India as a land where Muslims live free under democracy, that is a strategic advantage. We are viewed as an emerging great power precisely because we are an experiment that\u2019s working in a world thetas increasingly diverse and doesn't know how to deal with diversity. If we pull off this experiment, we will be the model for a world that is mixing faster now than it's ever done in its history. It is in our supreme national interest to ensure that our experiment works. If that means dealing with grave provocation in ways that are practically impossible, then that\u2019s what we have to do.\"  Join the Thomas L. Friedman Forum  Football Countdown: Giants Steps  Last week, Jets beat reporter Judy Battista visited the forum to answer fans' questions about the upcoming season. This week, Giants forum participants got the same chance with Buster Olney .  Olney on . . .  . . . the Giants' overall prospects for the season : \"You get the feeling that between the constraints of the salary cap and the impact of injuries, most teams are vulnerable, and that there isn't much of a margin between 6-10 and 10-6. Remember that at this time last year, everyone in the N.F.L. thought the Pats were one of the five worst teams in the league. But New England managed to build momentum into the middle of the season, they got lucky with Brady (lucky, in that they probably had no idea he would react so well under pressure) and they took off. I'm not suggesting that would happen to the Giants, but I think they'll be better than people expect.\"  . . . the mood of preseason camp : \"The players say it is more intense this year, and that's probably because of how many young players are trying to win jobs. Seems like every day there is a scrap between one of the young offensive lineman and one of the veterans on the defensive line, and rookies or young players are attempting to establish themselves at wide receiver, tight end, in the linebackers and the defensive backs and the special teams. Jeremy Shockey has clearly brought an edge to the offense, never backing down from the defenders in practice; the tenor of training camp changed dramatically after he arrived. This is probably one of the X-factors on the team this year.\"  . . . the players' respect for Coach Jim Fassel : \"I think they like him, absolutely. Does he inspire them? I can't say yes, yet, and I can't say no. The fact that they made the Super Bowl in 2000 suggests he's capable of getting their attention. The fact that they seemed to roll over at the end of last season suggests he lost them for a spell.\"  . . . whether this will be Michael Strahan's last season as a Giant : \"If the Giants have a decent season this year, Strahan stays. If they struggle, he's a goner, because they might feel that paying one player a lot of money apparently isn't going to help them win.\"  Join the Giants Forum  The Gourmet Tour de France  Norman Bogner reported his French food findings to the Gourmet Traveler forum:  \"In addition to the pork and choucroute specialties served in Strasbourg, I ate the best Indian food at La Maharaja. Boyer's in Reims (3 Michelin stars) lives up to its reputation. Our room was gorgeous, the shower had some pressure and dinner was marvelous: chicken a la Bresse with truffles was superb although I had better version at Marc Meneau's L'esperance several years ago. One night's lodging was 350 euros and dinner 380, but well worth it if you want to splurge. L'absinthe in Honfleur served a magnificent sole with a lobster sauce. Abbaye de Sainte Croix in Provence (check the relais-chateau book for address) in Provence delivered a magnificent Charolais filet in a red wine, bone marrow reduction. Very different from our \"prime\" mystery meat served at US restaurants, but then again it was Charolais. I was horrified to read that the Minguella brothers had sold Le Miramar in Marseille. I guess Pierre was worn out greeting people. Off the beaten track for discerning travelers, let me suggest Moulin de L'Abbaye, which is one of the most beautiful relais in France, ivy covered, over the Dronne river, superb visually and the restaurant has a view over the river as well. Brantome has not yet been discovered by the Americans and is an enchanting town with parks and interesting shops, pure French.\"  Join the Gourmet Traveler Forum  Houston v. Houston  When new people participate in the You Know You're a New Yorker When . . . forum, they sometimes repeat comments that have been made previously. The most common repetition is a New Yorker's insistence on referring to New York as \"the city,\" whether he or she is in Times Square, Kalamazoo or Taipei. Another oft-repeated post is the unique-to-New York pronunciation of \"Houston\" Street (HOW-ston).  What no one had ever explored is why Houston, the street, is pronounced differently from Houston, the city in Texas. Until Trangesr decided to explain it: \"New York City's Houston Street was named for William Houstoun (note spelling), a Georgia congressman, who married the daughter of Nicholas Bayard III. The Bayard family goes way, way back to colonial New York.  \"The street was originally named North Street, to delineate the northern limit of Henry Rutgers' (yes, of Rutgers University fame) holdings in N.Y.C.  \"Now you can go back to the pizza, puke, and smelly homeless people.\"  Join the Forum You Know You\u2019re a New Yorker When . . .

Gestures Are Now Baby Talk", "date": "2002-08-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from August 12, 2002, Section B, Page 4Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The handful of toddlers strode, all stiff-legged and gelatinous, around the room in pursuit of one another or the nearest stuffed animal. Around them in a circle, mothers and baby sitters, one with a guitar, sang songs about pigs and roosters and cows, gesturing with their hands around their faces.The little ones did not pay too close attention, even though all this was for their benefit. But every once in a while, one of the babies would make a relevant gesture -- rocking a make-believe baby, pretending to have cow ears -- to much appreciation from the grown-ups.Lora Heller's Baby Fingers class on the Upper West Side is one of a handful in the area teaching parents and infants as young as 6 months old to use rudimentary elements of sign language, though the babies can hear just fine.Ms. Heller remembers when her son, Zeke, was 10 months old and sitting in his crib with an urgent look on his face. ''He signed to me 'more music,' and all I had to do was turn on the mobile again,'' she said. ''There was no frustration, there were no tears.''People who attend Ms. Heller's class are sold on the idea that by using signs they will be able to communicate with their kids, even with just a few basic concepts, long before those children are physically able to talk. Some experts believe babies who use signs may get a head start in learning, not to mention enhanced interactions with their parents. A study by Linda P. Acredolo and Susan W. Goodwyn, professors of psychology at the University of California at Davis, and at California State University at Stanislaus, respectively, showed that second graders who learned signs as babies had intelligence-test scores that were, on average, 12 points higher than those who did not.But others look at baby signs as little more than the pediatric equivalent of stupid-pet tricks. Dr. Esther Wender, a clinical professor of pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, said that even calling baby gestures ''signing'' is misleading.''Using gesture is just part of normal development, and there's absolutely no reason to think that it's something someone needs to teach kids,'' she said. ''It's like trying to teach children to walk earlier. It just doesn't make sense neurologically.''Supporters of the concept say babies can start understanding and using simple signs around 7 or 8 months of age, and parents are encouraged to start off with a few simple ones -- making a fist as if to milk a cow means ''it's time to nurse''; bringing the fingertips together, palms in, means ''I want more''; pretending to wring out a rag indicates a diaper change.Andrea Fixell, who has a master's degree in deaf education from Teachers College, has taught signs to her son, Sam, 13 months, and dozens of other babies in ''Sign a Song,'' a music and signing course in Park Slope, Brooklyn.With the accompaniment of a guitar-playing father, her students learn signs for child-friendly songs like ''A, You're Adorable'' and ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight.'' Farms and modes of transportation (''Wheels on the Bus'') are other popular topics.''It really exposes them to language and motivates them to talk, because they see the power of language,'' Ms. Fixell said. A lot of people are concerned that if babies learn to sign, ''they won't use speech, but it's actually the opposite.''Other experts in child development say they think that those parents who hope the newest fashion among 6-month-olds can hasten developmental milestones have already declared themselves to be menaces.Dr. Wender, one of the skeptics about the long-lasting effects of signing, also wondered if the kind of parents attracted to ideas like signing with babies might skew the results of research about its effects.''Are you selecting a population of people who are very motivated to do things with their children?'' she asked.Mary Moran, who runs a signing program called Little Signing Hands, in Rockville Centre, on Long Island, said that when her son, Sean, was 20 months old, he was not speaking, but had made up sign names for family members, scrunching his hair with his hands for his grandmother, who has very curly hair, and hitting his nose for an aunt who gives Eskimo kisses.Improved communication, according to supporters of signing by babies, can have long-lasting effects.''So many families are telling us that the reason they don't have the terrible 2's and 3's with their children is because of communication,'' said Joseph Garcia, author of ''Sign With Your Baby'' (Northlight Communications, 1999), adding that he thinks tantrums are more common when children are frustrated by not being able to express themselves.Dr. Marilyn Daniels, a professor of speech communication at Penn State University, said she has done research showing that teaching signing to preschoolers can increase their English vocabulary by 15 to 20 percent. The research was published in her book ''Dancing with Words, Signing for Hearing Children's Literacy'' (Bergin & Garvey).No matter which side is right in the debate over effects of signing for babies, Ms. Heller says she believes that some benefits need not be studied with the use of carefully calibrated control groups, and could have benefits later in childhood.''If you're at somebody's house or a museum, and your child is about to touch something that's fragile, just sign the 'Touch No' sign,'' she said, ''and nobody else has to know that your child was about to do something that could have led to disaster.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/08/theater/an-international-gathering-for-the-deaf-in-the-arts.html", "headline": "An International Gathering For the Deaf in the Arts", "date": "2002-07-08T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 8, 2002, Section E, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.It took a very special performance of ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' to bring the theater to life for Willy Conley. Throughout his childhood in Baltimore, his parents frequently dragged him to plays. But for Mr. Conley, who is deaf, trying to read the lips of actors on a faraway stage was endlessly frustrating. By the time he was a teenager he had sworn off theater for good.Then one evening when he was a sophomore at the Rochester Institute of Technology, some friends talked him into going to a production of ''Cuckoo's Nest'' at the institute. The play featured an all-deaf cast, and from the moment the actors took the stage, interpreting their roles in vivid sign language, Mr. Conley sat transfixed.''It was the first time I was able to see the language,'' said Mr. Conley, who is 43. ''This art form that I was never able to experience was suddenly right there in my face, and I knew I had to be a part of it.''Mr. Conley, now an actor, playwright and director, is one of 400 artists -- visual, performing and literary -- whose works are being featured in Deaf Way II, an international arts festival and conference that begins today in Washington. It is sponsored by Gallaudet University in northeast Washington, the world's only four-year college and graduate school designed specifically for the deaf and hard of hearing, and will feature events at the Smithsonian Institution, the National Zoo and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.The weeklong extravaganza is said to be the largest event in any country devoted to deaf issues and the arts. More than 8,500 people from 108 countries have registered, and organizers are expecting hundreds more.The accompanying conference is attracting people from around the globe for lectures and workshops on an extremely wide range of topics, from the necessity of preserving sign language in an era of technological advances like inner ear cochlear implants, to scuba diving taught in an indoor pool by a deaf scuba instructor.The university convened the first Deaf Way conference in 1989, planning for 500 people. More than 5,000 showed up. This time organizers say they have received e-mail messages from people wanting to pitch tents on campus because the conference hotels are booked. (No tents or campers are allowed.)In addition to creating an exchange among deaf artists, festival organizers hope to bridge the gap between deaf and hearing audiences by infusing the nation's capital with deaf culture. All events off Gallaudet's campus, both free and ticketed, are open to the public. And roughly 1,000 students and staff from Gallaudet have volunteered to work as ushers and interpreters around the city. Information about the conference is available at www.deafway.org.''Typically when people talk about accessibility they talk about installing ramps or hiring interpreters, but what we're aiming for is programmatic accessibility,'' said Tim McCarty, the producer for the arts component of Deaf Way II. ''This is art that belongs on any stage, in any gallery. It's a statement to the general public that deaf artists belong anywhere other artists do.''The Smithsonian Institution, in its Arts and Industries building, is featuring ''History Through Deaf Eyes,'' an exhibition chronicling significant advances for and by deaf people in America.The National Zoo is presenting Animal Signs, an exhibition of paintings by Chuck Baird, a well-known American artist who is deaf, that fuse hand signs for different animals with the creatures' faces and bodies.The Kennedy Center is acting as host for several performances, including a production of one of Mr. Conley's plays, ''Falling on Hearing Eyes,'' a broad comedy about preserving historic elements of deaf culture. Dozens more events are taking place at Gallaudet, the Washington Convention Center and the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center at the University of Maryland in College Park, Md.In the lead-up to the festival, Gallaudet's sprawling 99-acre campus had been transformed into an international artists' colony. Performers, gathered in clusters, struggled to understand one another's native sign languages, reverting in a pinch to broad gestures and generic internationally used signs.Strolls across campus turned up a Belgian stained-glass artist rushing past traditional Chinese watercolor painters and sign-language storytellers from Germany, Australia and France, who were preparing their space for open stage performances. In a visual arts studio, workers hung paintings by artists from Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Romania and Italy, while in a nearby classroom an ensemble of deaf and hearing actors from the United States rehearsed a production entitled ''Black and Deaf in America.'' Meanwhile, a television crew from Norway prepared to interview a Norwegian theater troupe about its production of ''Little Red Riding Hood,'' and a group of Russian-born professional clowns lugging brightly colored costumes stopped on the street outside the university field house to perform an impromptu skit.Typical of the cultural convergence were nine dancers from China, Israel and the United States, all deaf, writhing in sync to funky techno-infused beats reverberating off the walls and through the floorboards. The dancers came together specifically for Deaf Way II, having met one another only two weeks earlier. They had been rehearsing from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. since then, to perfect an intricate ensemble piece called ''Again, in Another World,'' created for them by a deaf choreographer from Israel, Amnon Danti.After meeting the dancers, Mr. Danti asked a hearing friend who is a Middle Eastern dancer to pick recordings that would combine their various cultures. He then sat atop booming speakers to pick from the Eastern- and Western-influenced selections, relying on the vibrations from the music.The choreographer has been amazed by the group's precision and power. ''They have swallowed it whole,'' Mr. Danti said late last week, as the spent dancers flopped down on the floor for a brief break. ''Some people listen to music, and it influences them from the outside. But they feel it from the inside out. This is my dream come true.''For Mr. Conley, the theater director, who sat wide-eyed watching Mr. Danti's dance rehearsal, the festival is also the fulfillment of a dream. By exposing people to the richness of expression in deaf culture, said Mr. Conley, who is also an associate professor of theater arts at Gallaudet, ''this type of collaboration has the potential to change the way people -- deaf and hearing -- think about and perceive art.''In addition to ''Falling on Hearing Eyes,'' which will be performed by the Connecticut-based National Theater of the Deaf, the country's oldest theater devoted to deaf artists, Mr. Conley is staging a second production at Deaf Way II.The play, which he wrote and is directing with Iosif Schneiderman, a deaf Russian playwright, is titled ''Goya: En la Quinta del Sordo,'' which translates from the Spanish as ''in the house of the deaf man.'' Performed by an all-student cast from Gallaudet it depicts the life of the great Spanish painter, who lost his hearing in 1792 when he was 47.While some works in the festival, like the Chinese landscape paintings, include no identifiable deaf themes, others, like Mr. Conley's play, deal with issues in deaf culture.After his ''Cuckoo's Nest'' conversion, Mr. Conley, who worked as a medical photographer for five years before his burgeoning love for the theater eventually took over, earned a master of arts degree from Boston University in playwriting, and from Towson University in Maryland, in theater arts. He toured with the National Theater of the Deaf for three years.But as an actor Mr. Conley became increasingly frustrated. Most of the works the troupe performed were sign language interpretations of plays written by hearing playwrights. ''I wanted to create something culturally authentic,'' he said. In ''Falling on Hearing Eyes,'' which centers around a deaf museum curator and his bungling interpreter, the curator leads a tour to examine deaf cultural artifacts. He begins by dividing the audience into two groups: the deaf and the ''signing impaired.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/20/world/when-asylum-seekers-knock-europe-is-deaf.html", "headline": "When Asylum Seekers Knock, Europe Is Deaf", "date": "2002-06-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from June 20, 2002, Section A, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.If the Denmark that Muhammed al-Bayati reached after a harrowing journey from Iraq is not the one he hoped to find, neither, for that matter, is the rest of Europe.A doctor facing imprisonment by Saddam Hussein's government for his outspoken views, Dr. Bayati escaped the only way he could, paying a small fortune to a people trafficker and taking his chances in the back of a truck, concealed under piles of boxes.But Denmark, where he applied for asylum, has been rattled by the rise of a right-wing political party with virulently anti-immigrant views. So have other countries in the European Union, whose leaders meet on Friday in Spain to discuss an issue of consuming interest across the region: how to tighten Europe's borders to combat illegal immigration.Denmark, catching the mood across the Continent, recently passed a far-reaching law that tightens the criteria for asylum seekers, severely limits their rights while their cases are being considered, and makes it clear that immigrants are no longer welcome in a country once proud of its openness.Among other things, the Danish law forbids asylum seekers from marrying; cuts their welfare benefits; discourages the arrival of those 60 and older; makes it far harder for Danish residents to marry non-Danes and for immigrants to reunite with their families; and requires asylum seekers whose applications are rejected to leave Denmark that very day.''I am being treated like a criminal for seeking asylum here,'' said Dr. Bayati, who arrived more than a year ago and now sleeps in an asylum center two hours from Copenhagen and lives on a government handout of about $129 a month. ''You are running from the jail in your country to be in jail in Denmark, and still they are saying, 'We are a democratic country.' ''Denmark's law has dismayed advocates for refugees and led to unusual public criticism from the governments of Sweden and several other European countries. But as restrictive as it is, the legislation is of a philosophical piece with laws recently enacted or being considered in a Europe that is increasingly hostile to immigrants.When Europe's leaders meet in Seville, Spain, they are expected to speak about harmonization and cooperation in areas like border controls. But even as they discuss ways of keeping immigrants out of Europe, they seem determined to slowly but surely tighten their policies at home.Spurred by anti-immigrant talk from right-wing parties that are both provoking and capitalizing on fears of immigrants, many countries are under immense political pressure from voters to prove that their policies are as tough as those of their neighbors, if not tougher.While an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 people arrive illegally in Western Europe each year, the number applying for asylum has actually fallen in the last decade, to 384,334 last year from 673,947 in 1992. But that fact is buried under the weight of pronouncements that present Europe as awash in economic migrants aiming to rob residents of what is rightfully theirs.''Given the wave of anti-immigration sentiment, each of the countries is reverting to being as harsh as possible,'' said Dick Oosting, director of the European Union office of Amnesty International. ''It's become more and more restrictive over the years, but the way the issue is hyped up now is quite extraordinary.''In Britain, a law wending its way through Parliament would speed up the asylum process; deport more rapidly those whose applications for asylum fail; make a knowledge of English, Gaelic or Welsh mandatory for those applying for British nationality; and segregate the children of asylum seekers from children in British schools for six months after they arrive. Instead, the asylum seekers would be taught in special classes in asylum centers.The law would also allow Britain to deport failed asylum seekers within days to other European countries they have passed through en route to Britain, and would withdraw benefits from foreigners whose asylum claims have been accepted by other European countries but who then move to Britain.Meanwhile, a new law in Italy would, among other things, force all non-European Union immigrants to be fingerprinted in order to live in the country. Under the measure, people who employ illegal immigrants would be jailed or fined; illegal immigrants caught by the authorities would be required to leave the country within three days, instead of the current 15, and people who try to return to the country, having already been expelled, would be jailed.At a summit meeting in Tampere, Finland, in 1999, the European Union countries pledged to work toward a common asylum policy that would put an end to so-called asylum shopping, in which would-be refugees try to settle in the country with the most liberal policies.But it has not worked that way. Many proposals put forward since then, on issues like the right of immigrants to work while their asylum applications are being processed, and the reunification of immigrant families in Europe, have bogged down in bureaucratic wrangling.Europe has not been able to agree even on a definition of what constitutes a refugee under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, an issue that Denmark has pledged to tackle when it takes over the presidency of the European Union from Spain next month.''Politicians are running around with their heads in a spin saying, 'We must do something,' '' said Graham Watson, a Briton who is leader of the liberal democratic group in the European Parliament. ''But they don't have the courage to do something that might not be popular with their electorates, and they're not able to sit and look at the thing calmly and dispassionately.''Nowhere, it seems, has the anti-immigration mood sweeping through Europe had such an immediate effect as it has in Denmark, a country of 5.3 million people in which some 7.3 percent are from ethnic minorities and about 10,000 people applied for asylum in 2001. Denmark is proud of its liberal past: it was the first country to sign on to 1951 human rights convention, whose signers agree to take in foreigners facing persecution at home.The new law is a direct result of November's general election, in which the xenophobic Danish People's Party succeeded in making illegal immigration the main issue of the campaign. The party won just 22 seats in the 179-member Parliament, but those seats form a crucial voting bloc that the center-right coalition government of the prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, depends on to pass legislation.Denmark -- stung, especially, by a nasty war of words with Sweden -- has argued that it is being unfairly singled out for criticism and that its new law has merely put it in line with that of other European countries. Moreover, it points out, it grants asylum to 43 percent of applicants, a far higher percentage than in most European countries. Britain, by contrast, grants asylum to 26 percent of those who apply; Austria, 4 percent.But the law, which took effect last month, has already had a number of ripple effects, including a hunger strike by a group of asylum seekers in Copenhagen. Only 1,877 people applied for asylum in Denmark in the first three months of 2002, down from 3,114 in the previous three months.As harsh as the law is, immigrants in Denmark say, even more damaging is the way talk of exclusion has permeated the national mood.''There is this image of Denmark being this country where the police stop the traffic so the ducklings can cross the road,'' said Kamal Qureshi, a member of Parliament from the Socialist People's Party whose parents emigrated to Denmark from Pakistan when he was a toddler. ''The situation today is that if the refugees tried to cross the road, traffic would not be stopped.''As for Dr. Bayati, the Iraqi asylum seeker, his life is on hold while he waits for the immigration authorities to process his asylum application. For now, he is forbidden to work, although that should change under a new plan that would require asylum seekers to, at a minimum, work in the centers where they live in order to draw benefits.He spends his days at a Red Cross center for refugees, where he works as a volunteer and runs a discussion group for doctors seeking asylum from a number of countries.Fluent in English, he has also taught himself to read and write in Danish, and he has been waiting since the day he stepped off the smuggler's truck and told the first uniformed person he saw -- an ambulance driver, as it turned out -- that he wanted to apply for asylum in Denmark.''I am feeling very sorry that I came here,'' he said. ''I practiced at the most sophisticated teaching hospital in Iraq, but I cheated myself into thinking that in Europe there is something called democracy. I'm now persuaded that there is no democracy and no fairness in the world.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/13/opinion/the-big-ear-gone-deaf.html", "headline": "The 'Big Ear' Gone Deaf", "date": "2002-06-13T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from June 13, 2002, Section A, Page 39Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The most important person investigating the failure of our intelligence community to anticipate the attack by Al Qaeda is someone you never heard of.Her name is Eleanor Hill. Ten days ago she took up her duties as staff director of the Joint Inquiry Committee Into 9/11/2001. This assembles leaders of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (''Hipsi'') and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (''Sissi''). The new committee, with its freshly hired and cleared staff of nearly 30, does not yet have a nickname.Ms. Hill was a Florida prosecutor and later partner at King & Spaulding. She served for a decade as counsel to Senator Sam Nunn's subcommittee on investigations, and during the Clinton years as inspector general in the Department of Defense.The original choice to head the 9/11 inquiry was L. Britt Snider, who had been George Tenet's inspector general at Langley. Tenet had been the staff chief at Sissi (this column is being written in spookspeak -- Langley is C.I.A. headquarters, and Sissi you know) and some senators worried that putting Tenet's man at the head of the investigation guaranteed a whitewash of the C.I.A. and all blame dumped on the F.B.I.Snider, however, hired a C.I.A. associate without telling senators the fellow had polygraph problems. Both got the ax, and Sam Nunn mentioned Ms. Hill to Senator Richard Shelby. Result: Tenet -- half diplomat, half chief spook -- no longer has this inquiry under control.An early indication of Ms. Hill's seriousness is the attention being paid to the National Security Agency, based at Fort Meade, Md. Its worldwide eavesdropping facilities used to be known as the Big Ear, because the 38,000 N.S.A. employees, with their $7 billion budget, listen in on communications around the world.In theory, the N.S.A. then provides C.I.A. analysts with up-to-the-minute skinny on what terrorists tell each other on their cellphones. But the Big Ear is going deaf.It's bad enough that readily available encryption technology and fiber-optic cables often make N.S.A. techniques of interception obsolescent. Worse is that Osama bin Laden started substituting human messengers for cellphone calls four years ago.Worst of all, the N.S.A. will soon be revealed to be a huge vacuum cleaner aimed to listen to or look at key words but with no way to go through most of the millions of communications it does collect every day.Hold your hand as high as you can above your head to indicate how much data our present system collects. Then drop your hand to your knee -- that's how much gets translated into English. Then point at your ankle: that's how much goes to our intelligence analysts at the C.I.A. in time to be useful. As far as F.B.I. counterintelligence in the U.S. is concerned, that's in your little toe.As a result of the joint inquiry's hearings in coming weeks, we will learn of messages swooshed up by the N.S.A. in the weeks before Sept. 11 that were not translated, or not analyzed at the C.I.A. or sent to the F.B.I. If our intelligence ''community'' had been as coordinated as it should have been, terrorists might well have been headed off.How do we use this hindsight to gain foresight? Neither by leak warfare among scared bureaucracies nor by their triumphant seizures of incoming hoodlums accused of ''planning'' to build a panic bomb. Publicity about how great we are now is being used to overwhelm publicity about how dismal we were last year.Congress and the White House cannot escape the need for a commission to investigate failures and recommend wholesale changes. Even if legislated and appointed now, it will not be up and running with needed clearances for months. That's why responsibility falls on the joint inquiry to gather information now while the trail is relatively fresh -- to be turned over to the group charged with revamping our intelligence.One of the ultimate commission's tasks will be to find out why the oversight by Congress was so abysmal. Hipsi and Sissi won't like that, nor will judiciary committees that slept through Justice's ineptitude. But if we are to bolster our protection, we must use the evidence being gathered by Ms. Hill and company to shake up the whole system."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/22/books/books-of-the-times-stepping-behind-the-eyes-of-a-deaf-master-painter.html", "headline": "Stepping Behind the Eyes Of a Deaf Master Painter", "date": "2002-05-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from May 22, 2002, Section E, Page 9Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.OLD MAN GOYABy Julia BlackburnIllustrated. 239 pages. Pantheon. $23.There are biographies of the painter Francisco Goya, and many studies of his art. Julia Blackburn, a brilliant platypus of a writer -- because unclassifiable -- has written a book that is not a life of Goya, but her personification of it; not a study of his art, but a seismograph jarred by its earth shifts.When Ms. Blackburn wrote ''The Emperor's Last Island,'' an imaginative evocation of Napoleon's final exile on St. Helena in the South Atlantic, it portrayed the delusions of empire and greatness through a stout and aimless figure no longer disguised under a uniform and a grand purpose.''Daisy Bates in the Desert,'' an account of an eccentric Irish woman who escaped her constricted past to set up a part-fantasy life among Australian Aborigines, evoked a universal conflict: the passion to hold onto one's reality and the passion to escape it.''I am Daisy Bates,'' Ms. Blackburn breaks into its narrative, and goes on to locate herself explicitly in her subject's life, as if the most profound literary penetration required house sharing, even ownership. It is an extravagant device, not to be widely recommended for fear of the arbitrary and of an easy presumption. In ''The Emperor's Last Island'' and ''Daisy Bates'' -- call them inflected biographies -- Ms. Blackburn uses the device astonishingly well.She does something similar in ''Old Man Goya.'' The results are sometimes extraordinary and sometimes, for a variety of reasons, less successful. It is a high-risk enterprise, involving not the traditional ''What can I discover and reveal in Goya?'' but a more audacious ''What can Goya discover and reveal in me?'' At times, and it is when audacity triumphs, the two become the same.Her book draws partly on her reading, though she tells of having little Spanish and relying mostly on English and French. She whizzes through Goya's life. Age 4 to age 39, when he was painter to the king and hugely successful, is covered in four pages; Josefa, his wife, gets only a few lines. The author pauses here and there, mostly for the last years of his life, spent in Bordeaux with his devoted, valiant and much younger lover, Leocadia Zorilla.What she has written is less a biography than a journey, partly external and partly internal. She goes where Goya lived, along the routes he traveled, and through the countryside to seek the Spain and the Spanish faces he knew. It is something of a reverse process: where Goya rendered what he saw into images, Ms. Blackburn takes his images and attaches them to what she sees. In a sense her Goya is a painting by Goya. In another sense, and this may be the strong heart of a sometimes capricious book, it is a painting of herself by Goya.''Old Man Goya'' starts at home, when the writer was young. Her painter mother had a worn paperback copy of Goya's sketches, ''Caprichos,'' its spine ''broken and partially torn away, exposing the intimacy of the stitches that bound the pages together.'' The phrase suggests the pungent particularity of Ms. Blackburn's writing; it also suggests the fierce unstitching she does in pursuit of herself and her quarry.To a child utterly without a filtering layer, ''Caprichos'' was illumination and devastation: ''People becoming animals and animals becoming people. Masks to hide a face and faces turning into masks. Leathery old skin next to soft young skin and a thick blackness on all sides out of which monsters could emerge like rabbits pouring in an endless stream from a magician's hat. I was terrified by what I saw and yet I felt brave and somehow invincible because I had dared to look at it.''Throughout, the writer's evocations of Goya's work are not just intensely visual but virtually audible, and this to her most remarkable purpose. Ms. Blackburn writes to startling effect about Goya's total deafness from his mid-40's, roughly halfway through his life. Even at the start, telling of her first sight of the Black Paintings at the Prado, there is a hint of what she will do.''It was the noise of them that struck me first: an echoing reverberation of savage human voices all competing with each other and demanding to be heard. It was only later that I began to notice the silences as well, the great pools of silence that were every bit as powerful as the noise.''Later she evokes the altered universe of deafness, and a connection between the silencing of one sense and the uncanny intensification of another.''He is easily frightened by the way people erupt into view as if they have dropped from the sky, the way they rush in a silent torrent around him, whisper and laugh, creep up behind him and breathe on his neck. Everyone seems to mock his vulnerability except for those who are themselves vulnerable: the cripples, the very old, the mad, who immediately recognize him and accept him as one of their own.''It is intuition, this connection between silence and an urgency to see so intense that it will be denied by nothing: not convention, not the outward appearance of things. There are the monsters, the furious, the desperate, the beautifully free and, at court, those troll-like faces above the finely depicted silken and gold-adorned shoulders. Goya could get away with the faces because he made the costumes so splendid.Intuition, then, and imagination, and the writer's insistence on possessing what possesses her. To feel the deafness, she tries earplugs; to insert herself among the figures in the ''Caprichos,'' she buys a grotesque mask and tries it on.Then there is Ms. Blackburn's mother, owner of the book that started the journey. She is there at the end, too. Terminally ill, and days before dying:'' 'How is Goya?' she asks in that blank, deep voice and I tell her again that he is fine.'' How old when he died? she asks, and when told 82, '' 'Same as me,' she says and a lopsided wisp of a smile passes over the carved stone of her face. 'I went to the Prado,' she announces and in that moment she has fallen back into a restless sleep.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/07/technology/for-deaf-signers-a-glove-that-translates.html", "headline": "For Deaf Signers, a Glove That Translates", "date": "2002-02-07T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from February 7, 2002, Section G, Page 6Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.NECESSITY may have been the mother of Ryan Patterson's invention, but hunger played a role, too.Mr. Patterson, 17, was at a Burger King restaurant in the summer of 2000 in his hometown of Grand Junction, Colo., when he saw a group of deaf people buying their meals. Rather than try to communicate with the cashier, they used sign language with a speaking person who placed their orders for them.Out of that experience Mr. Patterson, a high school senior, developed a sensor glove that can take the finger movements of American Sign Language and translate them into text on a small display screen. The invention earned him a top award in December in the Siemens Westinghouse Science and Technology Competition and similar honors last spring at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.Mr. Patterson did not know anyone who was deaf or mute. Nor did he know any sign language. But aside from his experience at the Burger King, he had read about a student in Grand Junction who had an adult translator in high school, with the school district picking up the cost.''There is a very high demand for translators, and they are very expensive and hard to find,'' he said. ''I thought this might be a way for them to be more independent.''So using a golf glove, a circuit board, a laptop computer and some basic electronic parts, Mr. Patterson, who worked on his first electronics project at age 5, created the Sign Translator for a local science fair. He has since refined the device, replacing the laptop with a small wireless receiver and display unit, and applied for a patent for it. One company has inquired about manufacturing the glove, he said, but he is looking into doing that himself.In conceiving the project, Mr. Patterson realized that he would need sensors that could read the positions of the fingers. But the sensors, flexible strips of carbon-coated plastic that act as variable resistors, needed to be attached to something. He chose a golf glove because it has full fingers and is made from thin leather, making each sign easier to discern. Thinness also proved useful when the 10 sensors were sewn on the glove's fingers and wrist.But how could a computer know whether a hand was shaping a B or an E? Mr. Patterson designed a software program that could ''learn'' individual letters or words, making calculations based on the distance between the fingers and hand. A small processor and transmitter attached to the back of the glove send signals to the display unit.Because people's hands vary in size and because signing, much like voice inflection, can vary from person to person, the software learns an individual's quirks over time. Then the glove is ready to go into action, translating finger movements in about one-fifth of a second.Mr. Patterson said that the device was not intended for one-sided, brief interactions. ''It's for running errands like going to the cleaners or ordering food or being in the classroom,'' he said. ''There's no replacement for a human translator, and people who can't speak are going to need one at some point.''Technology has already found a niche in the deaf and nonspeaking world. ''This sounds a little like our digital pagers, which are ubiquitous on campus right now,'' said Mercy Coogan, director of public relations at Gallaudet University in Washington, which was founded exclusively for the deaf and hard of hearing. ''This device sounds like people would no longer have to fidget around for pencil and paper to write things down when they want to communicate.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/04/health/personal-health-needless-silence-for-hearing-impaired.html", "headline": "Needless Silence for Hearing Impaired", "date": "2001-12-04T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from December 4, 2001, Section F, Page 7Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Cindy Brody, my sister-in-law, was only 40 when she realized that something bad was happening to her ability to hear. Telephone conversations were a challenge and there were lots of misunderstandings even during one-on-one conversations, including those with her husband at the dinner table.But the day of reckoning came when she heard a riding instructor say ''to hell with her'' about a disabled woman who wanted to ride a horse, when in fact the man had said ''I'm helping her.''So she went to an audiologist to have her hearing checked. Sure enough, she had suffered a significant hearing loss in her left ear and some loss in the right ear as well. The audiologist said she could be helped by a hearing aid, and after several adjustments she is now using the aid successfully.Cindy is one of 28 million Americans who are hard of hearing, which makes hearing loss one of the most prevalent chronic health conditions in the United States, a condition that is becoming increasingly common as the population ages.But while hearing loss occurs most often in older people, with about a third of people over 65 and half of those over 75 affected, 1.7 percent of children as well as many middle-aged adults like Cindy also have significant hearing loss. In fact, 65 percent of hearing-impaired people are under 65.Denial and FearBut unlike Cindy, some 20 million of those with serious hearing deficits are, in effect, suffering in silence. Either they refuse to acknowledge their hearing difficulties or they are aware of the problem but are doing nothing about it. Many had once tried a hearing aid, but when the initial results were not satisfactory, they quickly gave up and left the aid to languish in a drawer. Others, fearing a stigma, never even tried.''Hearing loss is isolating,'' Cindy recalled. ''If you can't hear, you shut down, decrease your social activities and atrophy. I found that I easily lost interest in conversations. If you're watching television and blasting it, it clears the room. If you have the radio on in the car, you can't hear sirens. Hearing loss had an enormous negative effect on my day-to-day life.''In addition to difficulty hearing conversations, especially when there is background noise, people with hearing loss may experience fatigue and irritation caused by straining to hear. Some may have tinnitus -- hissing, roaring or ringing in the ears -- or dizziness and balance problems.It is not just insufficient volume that makes hearing difficult for people with hearing loss. As Cindy's story shows, it is also an inability to discriminate one sound from another because of a diminished ability to register high frequency sounds, or, in Cindy's case, low-frequency sounds.Since different letters and diphthongs are said at similar frequencies, one may be confused with another, with the result that people often say they can hear but they cannot understand what is being said. Words like ''hell'' and ''help'' or ''mass'' and ''map'' sound alike.Types and CausesThere are two main types of hearing loss. Conductive loss, resulting from a problem in the middle or outer ear, can be caused by a buildup of earwax, an infection or fluid in the middle ear or a punctured eardrum. Such losses are often treatable by drugs or surgery. Cindy's hearing loss, for example, was caused by calcification of a bone in the middle ear and could be treated surgically, which she plans to pursue eventually.More common is sensorineural hearing loss, which develops when the auditory nerve or the hair cells that line the cochlea in the inner ear are damaged by aging, noise, illness, injury, trauma, toxic medications or an inherited condition. Hearing specialists are already seeing the fallout among baby boomers and their descendants who listened for hours at a time to loud music piped directly into their ears or blaring from amplifiers.How Devices Can HelpSensorineural hearing loss is the type most amenable to correction by hearing aids. Hearing aids do not cure hearing loss any more than eye glasses or contact lenses cure vision problems. Neither do hearing aids restore normal hearing. But when properly fitted to meet the hearing needs and dexterity of the person, hearing aids can reopen the door to a much fuller and rewarding life.A hearing aid consists of three main elements: a tiny microphone that picks up sound, an amplifier that makes the sound louder and a speaker that transmits the sound into the ear.The differences between one aid and another involve where the aid is placed, how big it is, how it processes sound and how much it costs. Prices vary considerably,and neither private insurance nor Medicare pays for hearing aids.The latest wrinkle in hearing aids are digital models -- in effect, miniature computers -- that may cost as much as $3,700. Digital aids can be programmed through a modem to meet individual needs, and they adjust automatically to changing levels of environmental sound.They may also cause less sound distortion than traditional analog devices and greatly reduce feedback.But you do not necessarily need a top-of-the-line hearing aid to gain satisfactory improvement. For many people, a $1,000 aid or even one costing $500 works just fine.The trick in buying and successfully using a hearing aid is to start with a full medical evaluation (you may have a correctable problem, after all), preferably by an otolaryngologist, and then be tested by a reputable audiologist.Cindy had a bad first experience with an audiologist who told her, incorrectly, that surgery was rarely effective and could make her completely deaf; in fact, it is 90 percent successful in restoring normal hearing for people with her condition. She found another audiologist.Making It WorkThere are three other important criteria: the hearing aid vendor should provide a warranty and a trial period of 30 to 60 days, after which the aid is fully returnable for no more than a small rental fee; your willingness to return as often as necessary for needed adjustments; and your patience and determination to weather the break-in period.Sometimes you may have to go to a second vendor to have the aid reconfigured. But, in the end, as long as the auditory system has not been completely destroyed, nearly everyone with sensorineural hearing loss can be helped to obtain an aid that fits comfortably and meets that person's hearing needs.Do not expect miracles. You may have to get used to hearing background noises like the furnace or radiator that you could not hear before getting an aid. Also, loud high-frequency sounds may be more disturbing. Then, Cindy said, there are the insensitive things people might say like ''What's that in your ear?'' and ''How are you going to wear your hair to hide the hearing aid?'' as well as people who come too close or talk too loudly and slowly when they notice you have a hearing aid.Before pursuing the purchase of a hearing aid, you might check several Web sites for further guidance: www.shhh.org/about /howtoget.cfm; www.bosbbb.org/lit/0163.htm and www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/pubs_ hb/hearingaid.htm."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/09/us/limbaugh-tells-listeners-he-s-nearly-deaf.html", "headline": "Limbaugh Tells Listeners He's Nearly Deaf", "date": "2001-10-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from October 9, 2001, Section A, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Rush Limbaugh, the country's most popular talk radio host, with an audience that reaches 20 million a week, announced to his listeners yesterday that he had suffered severe hearing loss over the last four months and was almost totally deaf.Mr. Limbaugh, who has led the conservative talk radio movement for 15 years and who is widely acknowledged to have influenced several political campaigns, particularly the Republican takeover of both houses of Congress in 1994, signed the biggest contract in the history of radio in July. That contract runs for nine years, paying Mr. Limbaugh $285 million. His syndicator, Premiere Radio Networks, said yesterday that it remained committed to keeping his program on the air.Mr. Limbaugh, 50, said he would rely on advances in technology, which he would not specify, to keep broadcasting his daily three-hour program, which broadcasts five days a week.''I have options,'' Mr. Limbaugh said. ''I can still, even with this, get up and, if I want to, with the help of other people, come in here and do this radio program.''Any threat to the continuation of his program would be significant, several industry analysts said, in part because of the big contract. Mr. Limbaugh signed.''It's a huge tragedy for the industry,'' said Jerry Del Colliano, the publisher of Inside Radio, a daily newsletter. ''This man is the biggest star in an industry with very few huge stars. He's an icon in a business with very few icons.''Mr. Del Colliano and other radio executives expressed shock at the surprise announcement. ''It's just stunning,'' said Tom Taylor, the editor of another radio publication, The M Street Daily. ''It sent shock waves throughout the industry.''Several of Mr. Limbaugh's associates said that in recent months they had noticed a change in his speaking patterns. Mr. Limbaugh acknowledged on the air that listeners had sent messages asking why he sounded so different in recent weeks. ''It could well be that my voice is changing,'' he said. ''I don't know. I cannot hear myself well enough to know.''Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Limbaugh declined to comment beyond his remarks during his show yesterday afternoon.Mr. Limbaugh offered no concrete reason for the sudden hearing loss. He said he woke up on May 29 and found he could not hear in his left ear. From then on, he said, he has lost part of his hearing every day, despite seeking help from what he called ''the finest doctors and clinics throughout the country.''The only rationale he mentioned for what has happened was that ''there is some genetic hearing loss in my family.''After finding some help in hearing aids, Mr. Limbaugh said the hearing loss became so acute that even they were of no help.''I cannot communicate with people,'' he said. ''I can occasionally talk to people in person one on one. But I cannot hear radio. I cannot hear television. I cannot hear music.''Over all, he said he had lost all of his hearing in his left ear and 80 percent in his right ear. He said his doctors had told him that ''if the pattern keeps up, I will be entirely deaf, 100 percent.''Mr. Limbaugh has always relied on discussing issues with listeners who call into his program. Yesterday he took two phone calls, which he said he could not hear at all.''I'm not going to explain to you how we're doing this,'' he said. ''Put two and two together if you wish.''Mr. Taylor said Mr. Limbaugh could have assistants put the caller's words ''up on a teleprompter,'' but he questioned whether that could be done full time.Mr. Limbaugh said he would consider doing his show without phone calls. ''Or if I want to take calls, we'll find a way to do that,'' he said.However his program is presented, it is likely to continue to have a large audience, several analysts said. ''Rush is an incredibly talented broadcaster with an incredibly loyal audience,'' said Tim Wallace, a media analyst who follows the radio industry for Bank of America Securities.Mr. Taylor said: ''He understands the medium as well as anybody, and his fans love him. They'll stick with him.''But Mr. Del Colliano said: ''The indelicate question is how is this going to affect his voice? Even if it's possible for him to continue his career, how good is he going to sound? If he already sounds different, how much is his voice going to change?''One alternative, Mr. Del Colliano said, was a switch to a different medium. ''Thank God for the Internet,'' he said. ''Rush will always be able to reach his fans every day.''Mr. Limbaugh's condition was kept such a secret than even some of his closest friends were unaware of it. One friend who spoke to him on the phone two months ago said he noticed that he sounded different but thought ''he might be having dental problems.''This was about the time when Mr. Limbaugh was approached by CNN to consider taking a commentary role with that network. CNN executives said yesterday they also were unaware of his condition."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/15/jobs/deafness-meets-its-match-in-alter-egos.html", "headline": "Deafness Meets Its Match in Alter Egos", "date": "2001-08-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from August 15, 2001, Section G, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Like most trial lawyers, Kirstin Wolf has a ritual for courtroom presentations. She takes a seat at the counsel table, unpacks her Tumi briefcase, spreads out her papers and grabs a Uniball pen. But unlike most other lawyers, before addressing the court she first glances at the podium in front of the judge to make eye contact with her interpreter, Staci Noel.Ms. Wolf is one of fewer than 100 deaf lawyers in the country, experts say, and the sight of an interpreter in court is still unusual. Yet Ms. Wolf, 28, and Ms. Noel, 33, say deafness is no obstacle in the legal profession and they work to put others at ease. ''We're not trying to draw attention to Staci, since she's really supposed to be invisible in that setting,'' Ms. Wolf said.The women met two summers ago when Ms. Wolf was taking a bar review course after graduating from Boalt Hall, the law school at the University of California at Berkeley. Ms. Noel, who had been an interpreter for more than a decade, worked with Ms. Wolf for that course. ''Even though it was a high-pressure interpreting situation, there was an instant click,'' Ms. Noel said. They bonded over things like creating funny but memorable signs for words like ''tort'' that have no counterpart in sign language.That fall, Ms. Wolf joined Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, a law firm based in San Francisco and one of the country's largest, where she had been a summer associate. Ten months later, Ms. Noel followed.The firm realized that Ms. Wolf, who specializes in product liability litigation, would need a full-time interpreter for a job involving intense client contact, frequent travel and appearances in court on short notice. But it took some brainstorming to figure out a suitable arrangement.Under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, employers must provide ''reasonable accommodations'' for workers with disabilities. But the law, which is still evolving, does not define what is reasonable in any given situation. This has left many employers and employees to improvise.Accommodations are not new to Brobeck, which, 15 years ago, hired a lawyer who uses a wheelchair. The firm arranged for custom office furniture and modified its policies to allow him to fly first class -- small but critical adjustments.Gary Fergus, the partner who headed Ms. Wolf's department, said that when he saw Ms. Wolf's ''spectacular performance'' as a summer associate in a mock trial, his main concern was figuring out the best way for her to do her job. After she was hired, Brobeck supplied Ms. Wolf with various technological aids, including a teletypewriter, or TTY, device that allows deaf people to use the phone, and a pager through which Ms. Wolf can send and receive text messages. And the firm offered sign language classes; about 50 employees took them.Brobeck also expanded the interpreter's traditional role. ''Interpreting has its down time,'' Mr. Fergus said. So he suggested that Ms. Noel be trained as a paralegal on Ms. Wolf's cases, in part to make the job more interesting. That also allows the firm to bill out Ms. Noel's services when she is working in her paralegal capacity.Ms. Noel says that balancing two jobs means walking a fine line between divergent protocols. As an interpreter, she is bound by strict rules of confidentiality as well as a restriction on editorializing. But as a paralegal, she often has relevant knowledge of the work at hand. So, for example, when the two are meeting with others to discuss a pending case, Ms. Noel can speak freely about her own work, but if she is interpreting for Ms. Wolf, she can only repeat what the lawyer said.During phone calls, the two sit side by side in Ms. Wolf's office. Wearing a headset so that her hands are free for signing, Ms. Noel interprets what she hears. Ms. Wolf, who lost her hearing during surgery when she was 22, responds in her own voice.Though Ms. Wolf can use her TTY device for phone calls, or lip-read when meeting in person, she said it would be hard to deal with opposing counsel or others by relying exclusively on such aids. ''Having an interpreter means that I can communicate directly with people instead of losing the power and coming into a situation at a disadvantage,'' Ms. Wolf said.When Ms. Wolf is not speaking with others, Ms. Noel returns to her own desk in a cubicle outside Ms. Wolf's office and tackles her paralegal assignments. If Ms. Wolf's phone rings, Ms. Noel stops what she is doing and translates the call. When they visit a client to review documents for trial preparation, Ms. Noel's work is often paused to aid in conversations for Ms. Wolf on topics ranging from the progress of a case to the location of the soda machine. This constant gear-switching, Ms. Noel said, is the hardest part of her job.Ms. Noel usually works a 40-hour week, but on their frequent business trips, she keeps to Ms. Wolf's schedule, which tends toward the lawyerly 60 to 70 hours. At meals, instead of unwinding, Ms. Noel is still on the job. Ms. Wolf tries to make sure there is silence for part of every meal so that Ms. Noel gets a chance to eat.Other road challenges include the extra time it can take at a hotel check-in, verifying that there are proper safeguards, like a blinking fire alarm in Ms. Wolf's room.Getting used to having a relative stranger around you who knows the most personal aspects of your life is something any deaf person using an interpreter learns to deal with, Ms. Wolf said, but a good match makes all the difference. ''Some interpreters are really quiet and the communication is all one way -- you feel like saying, 'React!' because they turn into stone and, even when you are alone, make no comment at all about what they are hearing,'' she said.Ms. Noel says it is impossible to ignore what she hears. ''If you live 24/7 with someone day in and day out, I don't know how you would keep it so separate and stay sane,'' she said. To even things out, she tells Ms. Wolf what is happening in her own life.The marriage analogy comes up often when the two speak of their relationship. ''We can read each other like you wouldn't believe,'' Ms. Wolf said. ''If one of us is tired or hungry, the other knows instantly.'' When Ms. Noel is sick or on vacation, Ms. Wolf hires a temporary interpreter, but feels as though she's ''cheating on'' Ms. Noel.''Everyone will tell you that you shouldn't be friends with your interpreter because it is difficult for the interpreter to stay in role and be professional,'' Ms. Wolf said.Indeed, the interpreting community generally frowns upon muddying the roles. The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf in Alexandria, Va., warns that conflicts may arise in such situations. Still, said Jay Scirrat, a spokesman for the group, ''I have seen it work.''Both women concede that this concern is valid, but say they are forging their own path in a way that makes sense for them. ''We've had to work at this because it's a new game,'' Ms. Wolf said, ''but we're figuring it out as we go along.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/05/technology/screen-grab-web-sites-for-the-deaf-welcome-others-too.html", "headline": "Web Sites for the Deaf Welcome Others, Too", "date": "2001-04-05T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from April 5, 2001, Section G, Page 9Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.WEB sites for the deaf are really for everybody. Whether the sites are animated American Sign Language dictionaries, information and debates on signing and the role of hearing devices, medical primers, or soapboxes to vent anger over societal attitudes, there is hardly a page intended for deaf people that is not an eye-opener for everyone.Gallaudet University, founded for the deaf and hard of hearing, has its own history online, from its establishment in 1864 in Washington to its modern role of research and leadership (www.gallaudet.edu). Of particular interest is its history of the Deaf President Now protest, which shut down the college for a week in 1988 after the university trustees appointed a hearing person as the president (pr.gallaudet.edu/dpn). The strike ended with the appointment of Dr. I. King Jordan as Gallaudet's first deaf president, and it was considered a watershed in raising the self-esteem of deaf people.The university's National Deaf Education Network and Clearinghouse, part of the Laurent Clerc Center, posts an online magazine, Odyssey, about issues relating to the families of children who are deaf or hard of hearing.The center's Info to Go program has sites that are geared for young people (clerccenter.gallaudet.edu /InfoToGo); they explain deafness, the workings of the middle and inner ear, and resources on speech reading and sign language. There are lists of pen pals, schools for the deaf and summer camps. The focused electronic mailing lists include one for deaf Jews. A 1998 sample copy of the quarterly Gallaudet Today has a riveting article about the treatment of the deaf under Hitler (depts .gallaudet.edu/public.relations/gt).The center's KidsWorld Deaf Net Virtual Library has discussion groups, access to experts and a Web library, especially on lower-achieving or low-income deaf children.Another useful link, the Deaf Resource Library (www.deaflibrary .org), created by Karen Nakamura of Bowdoin College, has information about deaf cultures in Japan and the United States as well as many other deaf-related topics.Online sign language sites include HandSpeak (www.handspeak.com) by Jolanta A. Lapiak, which has 3,090 signs and is growing. Intended as a practical introduction, the site has minifilms and includes several signed short stories. There is also a list of reasons for learning sign language, some important (''SL is beautiful, unique and graceful'') and some amusing (''You can sign with your mouth full''). Another animated American Sign Language site, by Randy Stine, is at www.bconnex.net /%7Erandys/index1.html.A century and a quarter ago, debate on the best way to teach the deaf to communicate raged between the manualists, who emphasized sign language, which has its own nonverbal structure, and the oralists, led by Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, who was convinced that the deaf had to learn to use language based on oral speech.The debate continues, and it has been intensified by the development of the cochlear implant, a device that uses electrodes placed in the inner ear. The implants have helped many profoundly deaf people recognize sounds. To some, the implants are a godsend; to others, they are oversold and pose a threat to the hard-won recognition of sign language.A program on the issue produced last year for PBS, ''Sound and Fury,'' has a Web site called www.thirteen.org/soundandfury. A resource in itself, it has an evenhanded debate on cochlear implants between Nancy Bloch, executive director of the National Association for the Deaf (nad.policy.net), and Donna Sorkin, executive director of the Alexander Graham Bell Association (www.agbell.org). The sharp disagreements offer useful insights into how the deaf see themselves, their place in the world and the best way to ensure their happiness and their children's opportunities.And the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (www.nidcd.nih.gov), part of the National Institutes of Health, has a clearinghouse with a computerized database of references on communication disorders. Among its health brochures are an explanation of American Sign Language and a consensus statement about cochlear implants."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/21/nyregion/the-neediest-cases-conquering-isolation-of-deafness-and-mental-illness.html", "headline": "The Neediest Cases; Conquering Isolation of Deafness and Mental Illness", "date": "2001-02-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from February 21, 2001, Section B, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.On the day in 1986 when the police in Flushing, Queens, received a call that a homeless man was sleeping in their neighborhood's sidewalks, they did not have to go far to find him. The man, Michael Smith, then 43, slept behind the police station. The police picked him up and had him taken to the Bellevue Hospital Center psychiatric ward.''I wasn't sick,'' Mr. Smith explained. ''I was drunk.''He had trouble explaining himself to the police, though, because he is deaf, and was probably experiencing the same mental illness that has since been diagnosed as a psychotic disorder, according to a social worker who helps him, Roberta Ahouse.When he is not taking his medications, Mr. Smith can easily become agitated, especially when he talks about his finances, and can be paranoid, at times thinking people are talking about him. And although he was born fully deaf, before he started taking his medications he sometimes heard voices that he thought were coming from people he saw on television.But after spending two years at Bellevue, Mr. Smith moved to a supportive apartment building, the Terence Cardinal Cooke Residence in the Fordham neighborhood in the Bronx. The residence, which has space for 24 mentally ill deaf people, is run by the Beacon of Hope House, part of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.Many of those who live in the Cooke residence have schizophrenia or, like Mr. Smith, have symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia. Alan Bernstein, the director, said that one of the main aims of the Cooke residence was to get those who live there to interact with their peers.''It is an isolating disease, and it is very difficult,'' he said. ''But it's even more difficult when you're deaf and your ability to communicate with people is extremely limited.''After six years at the Cooke residence, Mr. Smith moved to an apartment in the Allerton neighborhood in the Bronx. He lives there now with a roommate. The apartment, like three others nearby that serve mentally ill deaf people, is run through the Beacon of Hope House's East Bronx Supported Housing Program.Ms. Ahouse comes by every two weeks to check on Mr. Smith, to make sure he is taking his medications. ''He is a model client,'' she said. ''He always takes his medication.''Mr. Smith, who lived with his parents for most of his adult life, said his new apartment was a step up from the group residence. ''When I moved in my apartment here, it made me very happy,'' he said in sign language as Bernadine Virani, a case worker at the Beacon of Hope House, translated. ''I can watch TV when I get ready to go out; I am more enthusiastic.''Besides the freedom it allows him, one of the greatest benefits of the supported housing program is that it gives him a number of people nearby whom he can communicate with. ''There's deaf people here, and I can associate here,'' he said. ''It's a freer atmosphere.''Though Ms. Virani is sometimes able to translate for Mr. Smith, she cannot be there for him and for the other clients all the time. The Beacon of Hope House trains all its social workers, including Ms. Ahouse, in sign language. But there are still times, as at a recent talent show, that outside sign language translators must be hired so that the deaf do not feel left out.Mr. Bernstein believes that New York State, which pays for the mental health services the Beacon of Hope House provides, should also pay for the interpreters' services, which can cost $100 an hour, and for other specialized services that are provided to deaf and hard-of-hearing people. He has helped form a coalition that is advocating that public money be used for services for the deaf. In the meantime, the costs are paid for by Catholic Charities, which uses money it receives from the Neediest Cases Fund.But for Mr. Smith and the other beneficiaries of the services, how they are paid for is of little importance. For Mr. Smith, the most important thing is that he can live on his own and support himself.

Every year, 12,000 American babies are born with moderate to severe hearing impairment and another 12,000 are born with lesser degrees of hearing loss.''A deaf newborn looks and acts like any other baby,'' said Dr. Andrew J. Schuman, adjunct professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School. There are rarely outward clues and, unless newborns are tested for hearing loss, it is often not detected until the child is 2 or 3 and fails to start talking.Such delays can permanently impair a child's ability to learn to speak intelligibly and can result in long-lasting social, emotional and academic difficulties.If a congenital hearing loss is not detected and corrected in the first months of life, the part of the brain that processes auditory signals fails to receive adequate stimulation and its development is likely to be permanently compromised. A delay of only six months can impede a child's language development, even with extensive rehabilitation.Yet, despite the existence of a patchwork of legislation in 32 states mandating screening of newborns for hearing loss, fewer than half the newborns in this country have their hearing checked before they leave the hospital.Each day, 18 American newborns go home with a hearing impairment or profound deafness that neither their parents nor their doctors are aware of.Adding to the poignancy of the problem is that relatively inexpensive, easy-to-use and highly accurate devices for detecting hearing loss are available, as are treatments like hearing aids and cochlear implants that can restore hearing to near normal.Hearing Loss in PerspectiveIn contrast to the 24,000 American babies born each year with significant hearing impairment, only 2,000 are born with cystic fibrosis, 800 are born with sickle cell disease, 800 are born with thyroid deficiency and 400 are born with phenylketonuria (PKU). Yet, standardized newborn screening programs exist throughout the country for all these disorders except hearing loss.Further, as noted by Dr. Schuman, who directs the screening at Elliot Hospital in Manchester, N.H., ''once the hospital buys the equipment, administering the test is not very costly -- about $30 a test, which is comparable to these other tests.''The estimated total cost involved in screening to detect each case of a hearing impaired newborn -- $9,600 -- is also well within the ballpark of these other disorders, he said. For example, it costs $6,000 to diagnose a single case of cystic fibrosis, $10,800 for thyroid deficiency, $23,000 for sickle cell anemia and $40,000 for PKU. And because it is much cheaper to rehabilitate a child whose hearing impairment is detected in infancy, screening programs for newborn hearing loss end up paying for themselves within a few years, according to advocates for universal screening.Seven years ago, a consensus panel convened by the National Institutes of Health concluded that the ''silent epidemic'' of severe hearing loss, warranted screening all newborns for hearing disorders, which affect one to three of every 1,000 babies born in this country. The panel also said that because as much as 30 percent of childhood hearing loss developed after the newborn period, periodic hearing screening should take place throughout childhood.Though professional groups were at first skeptical about these recommendations, in late 1994 universal newborn hearing screening was endorsed by the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, made up of representatives of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.Since then, many states have passed laws establishing the circumstances and timetables for setting up screening programs, and at least 400 hospitals now have screening programs. But in many states, the laws exempt small hospitals and birthing centers or insist only that a majority of infants be tested. Those loopholes allow many hearing-impaired babies to fall through the cracks. The only way parents can know for sure if their babies have been tested is to ask.Although some experts insist that newborn testing be limited to children at high risk for hearing loss -- like those with family histories of the problem, low birth weight or those born with herpes infections -- this stipulation means that half of hearing-impaired babies will not be tested and will probably be missed.How Newborns Are TestedIn recent years, several easy-to-use and painless screening tools have been marketed. With the most popular device, three electrodes placed on the baby's head automatically record brain wave activity in the auditory brain stem when a sound is played through earphones.It can be used on a sleeping newborn without disturbing the baby in any way. If an infant fails the test, it is repeated days or weeks later and, if the test is failed again, the baby is referred to an audiologist for more tests.Unfortunately, Dr. Schuman wrote in Contemporary Pediatrics, ''not all infants referred for evaluation after screening show up.'' He noted that in Colorado, ''as many as 50 percent may fail to do so.''Another screening device uses an ear probe to record ''evoked otoacoustic emissions'' -- tiny sounds made by cochlea hair cells when they are stimulated. One version costs about $5,000, uses earplugs that cost $1 and can be administered by a trained volunteer in a busy hospital nursery or doctor's office. Testing of both ears takes less than five minutes, Dr. Schuman said.Pediatricians with a testing device in the office can use it periodically to evaluate the hearing of patients who have repeated ear infections and fluid that remains lodged in the middle ear. If significant hearing impairment is detected, ear tubes may be recommended to unblock the ear canal until the child gets a little older.Parents, too, have a role to play. In addition to following through on recommended hearing checks, they should pay close attention to how the infant responds to sound. From birth to 3 months, a baby who can hear will react to loud sounds, be awakened by loud sounds, be soothed by a parent's voice, turn toward a parent when spoken to, smile when spoken to and seem to know the parents' voices.But Dr. Schuman cautioned that the usual clues used by parents and pediatricians to check a baby's hearing were unreliable. Even a baby with a severe hearing impairment may blink or act startled in response to a loud noise, like a loud clap. The baby reacts not to the noise itself but rather to vibrations set off by the noise. A hearing test is the only way to be sure an infant can hear normally."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/25/movies/film-review-in-the-world-of-the-deaf-hearing-poses-dangers.html", "headline": "In the World of the Deaf, Hearing Poses Dangers", "date": "2000-10-25T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from October 25, 2000, Section E, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.''Sound and Fury'' was shown as part of this year's New Directors/New Films Series. Following are excerpts from Anita Gates's review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 8. The film opens today at the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village.To many people it's an unexpected viewpoint. ''When all three of my children were born deaf, too,'' says Peter Artinian early in the film ''Sound and Fury,'' ''I thought, 'Great.' '' And he is not being ironic.A documentary about cochlear implants, the relatively new devices that allow many deaf people to hear, may not sound like anyone's idea of compelling filmmaking, but Josh Aronson's ''Sound and Fury'' -- which follows two branches of a Long Island family through the decision-making process about the implant's use -- is powerful, insightful, important and emotionally wrenching.The implant is a miracle, really. Most hearing people would assume that any loving parent of a hearing-impaired child would want this piece of medical technology for that child, because it would ease his or her way in the world enormously. For that reason Mr. Artinian's attitude may come as a shock.Mr. Artinian, his wife, Nita, and their three children are deaf. His daughter, Heather, decides she wants an implant. He is opposed. Chris Artinian, Peter's brother, is not deaf, but he and his wife soon learn that their newborn son is. And they very much want him to have the implant surgery. The opposing viewpoints make for painful family confrontations.''It's not intended for people to have a handicap,'' says the children's grandfather, who is not deaf, to his son, Peter. ''If I didn't know you, I would say you were an abusing parent.''The complicating factor here is deaf culture, the emotional and social bond among nonhearing people who use American Sign Language and have come to cherish their silent world as special and worth preserving. The eagerness of loved ones to jump on the cochlear implant bandwagon comes as a betrayal to some. As Peter says to his mother during a backyard get-together, ''I didn't know that you didn't accept deafness until now.''''Sound and Fury'' is asking some big questions. In a socially aware culture, people profess to believe that no skin color, religion, sexual orientation, political ideology, chronological age or physical attribute is superior to another. They say that differences should be celebrated; thus the corporate buzzword of the moment, diversity.Are the deaf parents in this film calling the culture's bluff? Or is a physical disadvantage truly something that should be celebrated? Do parents have a right to keep their children at a remove from the hearing world just because, in their opinion and experience, deaf is beautiful? Have we gone so far in our fear of offending anyone that we now advocate disadvantages' being deliberately preserved? Or do the hearing-impaired have a right to rear their children within a somewhat separatist subculture? The Amish have been doing that for quite a while.The most telling event in the film is Nita Artinian's change of heart. In the beginning she supports her daughter Heather's request for the implant and, in fact, wants one herself. But after Nita learns that the implant will be far less helpful to her as an adult, she changes her mind. ''We're afraid that the cochlear implant will change her identity,'' says Nita after a visit to a preschool class of children with implants.Later, in a scene between mother and daughter, Nita uses the word ''we'' in discussing the decision. Heather corrects her with ''I thought you decided.'' Nita answers: ''Don't you remember? We decided together.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/22/health/vital-signs-outcomes-aid-for-deaf-as-possible-cost-saver-too.html", "headline": "Aid for Deaf as Possible Cost-Saver, Too", "date": "2000-08-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from August 22, 2000, Section F, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Cochlear implants have been used for almost a decade to help thousands of profoundly deaf children, but some two-thirds of insurance companies are often unwilling to pay, citing a lack of evidence that the devices are cost-effective.A new study, however, reports that over the course of a deaf person's life, the implants can save more than $50,000 in costs associated with the disability. It also found that the devices, used in children who are not helped by conventional hearing aids, have made a difference in the lives of the children using them.''Cochlear implants in profoundly deaf children have a positive effect on quality of life, at reasonable direct costs, and appear to result in a net saving to society,'' researchers at Johns Hopkins University wrote in a recent issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.The researchers based their conclusions on a study of 78 families of deaf children.Although the cost of the implants is well over $10,000, the cost to society of someone who develops profound deafness as a young child is believed to be over $1 million, the report said.

Each center signed the agreement. An agreement with a similar primary care umbrella group is pending upstate, officials said.Rather than face a lawsuit, the institutions agreed to a vast array of conditions, including a promise to provide interpreters more or less on demand for patients who request them.''This is the broadest consent decree we have seen,'' said the attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer. ''This is an agreement we hope will become a template for other institutions that have similarly failed to be as accommodating as is called for under the A.D.A.''According to the complaints, deaf patients were often erroneously told that they were not entitled to interpreters or that they should bring their own. The disabilities act requires employers and institutions to provide accessible services to people with disabilities.In one case, a deaf woman who could not speak sought treatment in the emergency room of a hospital that the attorney general's office would not identify. Unable to communicate with hospital workers, she was told that she was well and was sent home, where she later had a miscarriage.''She was bleeding profusely and asked for a sign language interpreter,'' said Hilary Klein, an assistant attorney general. ''She had no idea what was going on. She was told she was fine and to go home. No one was called. It was communicated to her that she was fine.''In another case, a man with serious eye problems who needed surgery was told that he should ask his daughter, who lived in Pennsylvania and had accompanied him on previous medical appointments, to move back to New York, Ms. Klein said. Other cases included women who were unable to understand the dosage for medications for their children.Under the terms of the agreement, the hospitals and doctors' offices will have to provide an interpreter for people who cannot hear within an hour of their arrival. If a patient gives more than two hours' notice, the interpreter must be available when he or she arrives. The only exception is for Montefiore during nights, weekends and holidays, when patients will be required to give four hours' notice to have an interpreter available on arrival.The centers must also either contract with a company that provides interpreters, or hire someone whose job description would include that role. Interpreters usually charge about $75 an hour, Ms. Klein said. Hospitals must also train their staff to work with deaf people, and provide refresher courses.Organizations that represent people who are deaf or hard of hearing have lobbied hard in recent years for similar agreements from medical centers around the country. ''Access to health care is the No. 1 problem that deaf and hard-of-hearing people encounter,'' said Marc Charmatz, director of the National Association of the Deaf Law Center in Silver Spring, Md.The health care industry has not been a target of enforcement in recent years, said Laura Rothstein, a professor of law at the University of Houston and an expert on the disabilities act.Many health care institutions have had difficulty trying to comply with the law. ''There is real recognition of need for guidance on what is reasonable in terms of interpreters,'' Ms. Rothstein said. ''It is one of the most complex issues, because the service that is needed is both costly and not necessarily available. It is not reasonable to expect 24-hour-a-day sign language interpreters to be available, and health providers want the guidelines.''In 1998, the Department of Justice pressed health care centers in Connecticut to provide interpreters, although with less stringent requirements than Mr. Spitzer's.Many centers have wanted to avoid the high cost of interpreters, or have considered themselves exempt.''We felt the law does not cover private offices,'' said Dr. Paul De Stefano, president of United Medical Associates, one of the largest primary care networks in Brooklyn. ''But more or less we all feel that the disabilities act is appropriate, so we reached this agreement and we plan to implement it.''Irving Ballen, a lawyer representing New York Community Hospital, said the agreement ''speaks for itself.'' He added that he did not think that Community Hospital was one of the most egregious violators in the city. A spokesman for Montefiore, in a statement, said, ''Montefiore Medical Center has long been committed to serving its patients with special needs and has had policies in place to address the needs of the deaf and hearing impaired.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/19/us/national-news-briefs-emergency-broadcasts-to-get-captions-for-deaf.html", "headline": "National News Briefs; Emergency Broadcasts To Get Captions for Deaf", "date": "2000-04-19T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from April 19, 2000, Section A, Page 19Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The Federal Communications Commission has adopted a rule requiring television stations to accompany any announcements about emergencies with text messages for deaf viewers.The rule is part of a plan to make telecommunications and technology more accessible to disabled Americans.The reports would include details about areas affected by emergencies, evacuation orders and routes and approved shelters, officials said.The commission chairman, William E.

Stokoe Jr., an iconoclastic linguistics professor whose championing of sign language helped change the way deaf people are educated around the world, died on April 4 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 80.Dr. Stokoe was credited with winning recognition of American Sign Language as a genuine language, overcoming the contentions of linguists that it was little more than a rudimentary imitation of the spoken word. Eventually, Dr. Stokoe's work helped end a century-long banishment of signing from the classroom and won him a hero's status among many deaf students.''People say it was a bombshell,'' Dr. Oliver Sacks, the author and neurologist, said of Dr. Stokoe's work. But he added: ''It was a rather slow bomb. The recognition he encountered was by no means immediate, because of very entrenched sort of attitudes, even among the deaf themselves.''When Dr. Stokoe (pronounced STOH-key) arrived in 1955 at Gallaudet University, the only university for the hearing-impaired in the United States, he knew little about sign language or even about deafness. His only extended encounter with it came in his dealings as a farm boy in Stafford, N.Y., with a local blacksmith who was deaf, said Jane Maher, who wrote a biography of Dr. Stokoe. The two used to pass each other notes, Ms. Maher said.Dr. Stokoe went to Gallaudet, which is in Washington, to teach English. His passion was Middle English, and like all other professors at the university, he was expected to instruct without using sign language.Since the 1880's, when a movement against signing began at an international conference in Milan, schools for the deaf had insisted that their students communicate orally, an often unsuccessful practice that involves lip-reading and trying to produce understandable sounds. Opponents of signing believed that oralism, as the teaching method was known, offered students their best chance at becoming part of the hearing world, and in the early days of the movement, those who were caught signing were punished.Among themselves, of course, students signed away, relishing the opportunity to communicate freely in the fashion that had arisen spontaneously throughout history whenever deaf people were together in sufficient numbers. Dr. Stokoe had studied some linguistics, and when he saw the signing at Gallaudet, he became fascinated.''He underwent a sort of conversion, an epiphany and a revelation when he got to Gallaudet,'' said Dr. Sacks, who knew Dr. Stokoe for about 15 years and wrote an introduction to Ms. Maher's book. ''And he realized intuitively that something remarkable was going on among the students. And then he became sort of learner as much as teacher.''In his last book, ''Language in Hand'' (which Gallaudet University Press is now putting together), Dr. Stokoe wrote, ''At that point, my idea was simply that the signing American deaf people do is a language.''Five years after he arrived at Gallaudet, Dr. Stokoe published the groundbreaking ''Sign Language Structure.'' Four years later, he was the co-author of ''A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.''The books helped prove that sign language met the definition of a language. If every dissenter was not convinced, Dr. Stokoe's beliefs gradually drew wide acceptance and persuaded schools for the deaf to re-evaluate their approaches. It is now common for schools to use both oral and signing methods of instruction.If Dr. Stokoe's work proved persuasive, he himself was often nothing less than contentious, associates said. In her biography, ''Seeing Language in Sign: The Work of William C. Stokoe (Gallaudet University Press, 1996), Ms. Maher recounts how he earned the nickname Stubborn Stokoe in high school after convincing his physics teacher that he deserved a 100, not a 98, on an exam. (He was also gifted at language, learning to read by 3, Ms. Maher said.)Stubbornness was a trait that remained with him for life. In his last book, he still sounded scornful of those linguists who had accepted the ''fallacy'' that lack of speech meant lack of language, arguing that ''demographics and cultural oppression facilitated the conceit.''''This cultural oppression made encountering deaf signing an even rarer occurrence than deaf people's small number would merit,'' Dr. Stokoe wrote. ''Virtually everyone's first impression ('These people are not speaking!') led to the false conclusion that they were not using language. Instead of seeing language in a different channel, the naive observer, hearing no speech, supposed language was absent too.''Dr. Stokoe's work made him highly respected among deaf students, especially as some became radicalized in recent years. ''He was really quite revered by deaf people throughout the world for this accomplishment,'' said a longtime friend, David F. Armstrong, the budget director at Gallaudet.Although he was not active in the effort, Dr. Stokoe, many people believe, was a driving force behind the student demonstrations in the 1980's that forced Gallaudet to choose its first deaf president.One reason Dr. Stokoe was not involved was that he was caring for his wife, Ruth, who died last year after battling Alzheimer's disease. When he could no longer care for her at home, Ms. Maher said, Dr. Stokoe visited her every day in the nursing home, reading to her from her favorite English books. Ruth Stokoe had helped her husband operate Linstok Press, a publisher. Dr. Stokoe, who became emeritus professor in 1984, was also the founder of the journal Sign Language Studies.Dr. Stokoe is survived by a son, James, of Chevy Chase, and a daughter, Helen, of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.Associates said Dr. Stokoe would be remembered, if not necessarily mourned, for another passion besides sign language: playing the bagpipes. He was a member of the Washington Scottish Pipe Band and liked to march around the Gallaudet campus in full regalia, ignoring -- or perhaps enjoying -- the reaction.''The deaf students would joke that there were very few times that they were happy to be deaf, but that this was one of them,'' Ms. Maher said. ''Because the screeching was unbearable.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/27/business/media-2-new-systems-to-help-deaf-and-blind-at-movies.html", "headline": "2 New Systems to Help Deaf and Blind at Movies", "date": "2000-03-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from March 27, 2000, Section C, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.The heads-up display, a staple of Hollywood science fiction and films about jet fighter jocks, has made the leap from the big screen -- right into the darkened theater.A version of the futuristic displays -- translucent screens that can carry text and images, but can also be seen through -- is being introduced as a way to let deaf filmgoers view subtitles that are not visible to those in the audience able to hear the dialogue and soundtrack.The technology, along with a separate system that lets blind people use headphones to hear a running description of the on-screen action, has been developed by the National Center for Accessible Media. The center, a joint effort of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Boston public television station WGBH, is trying to adapt systems already used in TV broadcasting, in hopes of enabling the deaf and the blind to attend movies in conventional theaters alongside people who do not have hearing or vision problems.The General Cinema theater chain, a partner in the tests, recently installed the systems in one of the theaters at its Bay Plaza multiplex in the northern Bronx. The systems also are available at General Cinema Clifton Commons in Clifton, N.J.With the text-display system, called rear-window captioning, subtitles are displayed, in mirror reverse, on a 7-foot-wide, 16-inch-tall light-emitting-diode screen at the rear of the theater.A person watches the film through a small smoked plexiglass panel, which reflects the subtitles behind her while allowing the person to also see the movie screen at the front of the theater. The panel, 4 inches by 12 inches, is attached to a gooseneck extension that fits into the cup holder on the armrest of the theater seat.The rear-window captioning system can be disorienting at first and takes some getting used to. In fact, some advocates for the deaf and hard of hearing have criticized the system, including Cheryl A. Heppner, executive director of the Northern Virginia Resource Center for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Persons.Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0Feb. 4, 2022, 1:43 p.m. ETHere\u2019s what you need to know about the January jobs report.Architects at a prominent New York firm drop their unionization bid.Hertz hires a former Goldman Sachs finance chief as its C.E.O.Ms. Heppner discussed the system in a message posted to the Media Access Mailing List, an online discussion group. ''With only a few exceptions,'' Ms. Heppner wrote, ''most of the people I have heard from dislike rear-window captioning, and some cannot use it at all.''But when she was asked to elaborate in an e-mail interview, Ms. Heppner said she supported the development of rear-window captioning in the absence of a better solution.The descriptive video service, called DVS Theatrical, delivers a spoken interpretation of the visual elements of a film to special headsets.The Bay Plaza theater is the 10th General Cinema house in the country to install the descriptive-video and captioning systems, which are also available at a number of specialty theaters around the country like Imax and Disney theaters.General Cinema's first installation of the systems was at a multiplex in Los Angeles in 1997, for the openings of ''The Jackal'' and ''Titanic.'' Brian Callaghan, a spokesman for General Cinema, which is owned by the GC Companies, said the chain was supporting the technology because, ''Our job is really bringing movies to the public -- not just bringing movies to the sighted and the hearing public, but bringing them to all the public.'' The installation in the Bronx, he said, cost about $12,000.Captioning and descriptive video have been available on television and in home video releases for some time. The National Center for Accessible Media has more than 200 captioned and descriptive-video titles in its video library, and there is a limited amount of described programming on PBS and on the Turner Classic Movies cable channel. The descriptive narration is carried on the SAP -- or second audio program -- on stereo televisions.While General Cinema is voluntarily testing the systems, some people with disabilities are bringing pressure on the movie theater industry to move faster.Last month, citing the Americans With Disabilities Act, eight hearing-impaired Oregonians filed a lawsuit against several national theater chains, complaining of insufficient access to first-run movies. Their lawyer, Dennis Steinman, said his clients were waiting for hearings to be scheduled, to determine whether they have legal standing to file a class-action suit."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/08/theater/theater-review-singers-tragically-deaf-to-a-rising-din.html", "headline": "Singers Tragically Deaf to a Rising Din", "date": "1999-03-08T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from March 8, 1999, Section E, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Think of ''Beatlemania'' as performed by six lesser Victor Borges, and you have some idea of the theatrical impact of ''Band in Berlin,'' the engagingly sung, dramatically inert new musical play that opened last night at the Helen Hayes Theater.''Band in Berlin'' is not so much a play as a kind of docu-cabaret. Through slide projections, re-enactments of newsreel clips and the jukebox-style performances of a stream of Teutonic folk songs and American pop standards, the show recounts the rise and fall of the Comedian Harmonists, the renowned German singing group forced by the Nazis to disband because three of its members were Jewish.The story of a troupe of entertainers caught in the path of the Nazi campaign of anti-Semitic propaganda and terror certainly has the makings of compelling theater. (The singer Barry Manilow has written his own musical, ''Harmony,'' based on the group's travails, and a new movie about it, ''The Harmonists,'' opens on Friday.) But as directed by Susan Feldman and Patricia Birch, ''Band in Berlin'' reduces the value of this material to the level of idle curiosity. And I do mean idle. Midway through a musically monotonous, 90-minute program, during which 22 numbers are performed in German and English by five singers and a pianist, you may begin to feel like a heavy-lidded motorist, struggling against the effects of highway hypnosis.The show is, unintentionally, the lullaby of Broadway.Ms. Feldman, artistic director of the St. Ann Center for Restoration and the Arts in Brooklyn Heights, has been quoted in interviews as expressing doubt as to whether ''Band in Berlin'' belongs on Broadway. Her skepticism is well founded. The production cries out for a more intimate environment. That's because the scope of the piece is so limited; it's rarely anything more than a skillful impressionists' act. Hopscotching from one precious number to the next -- the singers became famous for their meticulous harmonies, their uncanny ability to mimic musical instruments and their gentle clowning -- the show steadfastly refuses to engage some of the most fascinating issues it raises: Who exactly were these performers? How did they feel when the Nazis drove a wedge among them? And what impact did that have on their relationships and the rest of their lives?Casting singers rather than actors probably precluded this type of exploration. To a large degree the show's creators rely on a seventh character, an older version of one of the Harmonists, played by Herbert Rubens, to supply emotional context. Portraying the group member Roman Cycowski, Mr. Rubens appears in a black-and-white mock documentary that is projected onto a screen at the back of the stage and relates in broad outline the group's history.The attempt is to provide the story with a touchstone, but it has the opposite effect; the film makes the performers onstage seem duller and all the more remote. The narration rarely pierces the play's placid surface. (''It was wonderful fun, and we thought nothing could happen to us because we were famous'' is about as candid and probing as the commentary gets.) In some instances the phony documentary only succeeds in wasting time, as when it depicts the group members on tour, clutching suitcases and dashing this way and that.At other times Mr. Rubens's disembodied voice is broadcast in the theater, and this, too, can be a clunky device. For example, as he describes each of the group members, a spotlight is trained on that vocalist, who is forced to stand there like a statue, smiling and nodding in strained silence. The performers fare no better in a scene that depicts an incident in Stuttgart, where a Nazi effort to shut the group down is thwarted by their devoted fans; it fails to impart any sense of the Harmonists' turmoil.One of the points of ''Band in Berlin'' may be that the Comedian Harmonists were indeed at some remove from reality through much of the Nazi era, oblivious, like much of the German public that revered them, to the magnitude of the threat they faced. (It may also be intentional that it's almost impossible to remember which men onstage are supposed to be Jewish.) But turning them all into singing shadows is not a particularly effective way of unlocking an audience's empathy, except perhaps for those who have warm memories of the group or a special admiration for their style of singing.On this last score, at least, the creators of ''Band in Berlin'' have done their homework. The five vocalists, played by Mark Bleeke, Timothy Leigh Evans, Hugo Munday, Peter Becker and Wilbur Pauley, and the pianist, Robert Wolinsky (all members of an actual musical group, Hudson Shad), are adroit with the Harmonists' material. In their top hats, tails and shimmering harmonies, they have no trouble convincing us they are the real thing.The performers may not be given a chance to emote, but they are certainly unassailable as trombones and violins. In the evening's most pleasing number, the overture to ''The Barber of Seville'' is recreated entirely through impersonations of musical instruments.Much of the remainder of the program puts you in mind of that alpine talent show in ''The Sound of Music'': the Comedian Harmonists might have been the group that went on just before the Trapp family. Their repertory ranges from covers of hits like Duke Ellington's ''It Don't Mean a Thing if It Ain't Got That Swing'' to saccharine renditions of novelty songs like ''Mein Kleine Gruner Kaktus'' (''My Little Green Cactus''), for which the singers slip on green oven mitts with little yellow protruding spines.To appreciate the Comedian Harmonists' story, you have to feel something for their unique predicament, otherwise they're just Deutsche Beach Boys. Ms. Birch, the Broadway choreographer, and Ms. Feldman, who wrote the piece, provide the bass notes and the footnotes. But they never strike more resonant human chords.BAND IN BERLINWritten and conceived by Susan Feldman; directed by Patricia Birch and Ms. Feldman; co-conceivers, Wilbur Pauley and Ms. Birch; musical director, Mr. Pauley; production staged and choreographed by Ms. Birch; sets by Douglas W.

It matters little how many aunts and uncles come over to share the turkey when none of them use sign language.That is one reason that, in 1996, the Rhinelander Children's Center started its Saturday Program for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Teen-agers -- New York City's only weekend recreational program for deaf teen-agers.The center is run by the Children's Aid Society, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The fund, which is to begin its 87th annual appeal on Sunday, helps Rhinelander serve poor, deaf children free of charge.At Thanksgiving and Christmas, the fund helps makes it possible for the needy, not only at the Rhinelander center but also at nursing homes, soup kitchens and community centers, to enjoy holiday meals that they might otherwise have to do without.On Saturday, the UJA-Federation of New York helped 140 elderly people, some in wheelchairs, travel to the Fashion Institute of Technology, where they dined on turkey and danced to Sinatra. In recent weeks, the Community Service Society of New York gave money to 50 poor families so parents could present the meal themselves. Catholic Charities distributed 41 turkeys yesterday to immigrant families at its Western Queens community center.At the Rhinelander center on East 88th Street, about 40 teen-agers gathered on Saturday for the center's third Thanksgiving celebration, ready both to cook and then dine on their meal.They met in the downstairs recreation room to plan culinary strategies. Dara Schuller, an adult group leader who is hard of hearing, offered cooking assignments orally and in American Sign Language.''Who are the corn people?'' she asked. ''Vegetables?''Hands shot up.The downstairs oven at the center was broken, so once responsibilities were decided, the teen-agers went upstairs to a cramped kitchen on the second floor.There the throng of bodies combined with the volume on the radio to create mass chaos as they peeled potatoes, greased pans for biscuits, blended a cake mix and struggled to shut the oven door on a 24-pound turkey.No parents were present; youngsters cooked and cleaned for themselves. One young woman chided a young man who had done a careless job of washing a pan; he turned the hot water on full blast and did it right.By 1 P.M., the potatoes were mashed, the cake baked, the macaroni mixed and the chefs famished. Yet no one took a bite until everyone had expressed thanks.Boys removed baseball caps. Near-silence replaced tumult as several youngsters spoke. Others used signs, and staff members translated each offering.''I thank you all for feeding me, because you know I'm poor,'' said one young woman wearing a fake diamond tiara.A girl named Ariel was swamped with hugs when she said, ''Thank you all, because you are my family.''And Corey Jordan, 17, earned grand applause when he said, ''I'm thankful for this program, because if it weren't for this, I would be out in the street with all the wrong people.''They gave thanks when they could have complained.Anthony Rosado, for instance, used to enjoy television shows like ''Wonder Woman,'' but he cannot follow the plots anymore because the closed-captioning box on the set broke and his mother cannot afford a new one.For Churlyn Sealey, 17, the telephone is just another piece of silent plastic. Her foster parents do not own a translation box, a device that turns telephone speech into written words. It's the sort of aid that enables a deaf teen-ager to keep up with the after-school gossip.These are areas where the Neediest Cases Fund can help.Denise Taylor, the center's program director, hopes to use money that the fund provides to the Children's Aid Society to get closed captioning for Anthony, and a phone device for Churlyn.Last year, readers of The New York Times contributed a record $5,811,568 to the fund. The Times does not solicit contributions to the fund. Instead, it publishes articles, beginning the Sunday after Thanksgiving, until Feb. 28, about the people the fund has helped and the donors who made assistance possible.The Times pays the fund's administrative costs so every dollar donated goes directly to New Yorkers in need. Donations are tax-deductible, and The Times's auditors insure that the money helps those who need it most. The charities supported by the fund are among the oldest, most respected in New York, and were selected in an attempt to help as many poor New Yorkers as possible.''The fund provides everything from crib mattresses to turkey dinners to emergency dental care, so its impact touches almost every facet of the lives of New Yorkers in need,'' said Phil Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society.Yet there always seems to be more to do -- in housing projects, in hospitals, in schools, in job training centers and among the deaf teen-agers at the Rhinelander center.Sometimes there are no clear solutions. Mark Esposito is 17, yet he is scared to walk through his Queens neighborhood alone, because he cannot know who might be sneaking up behind him.And while Anthony Rosado exulted briefly on Saturday when he discovered that the program offered free instruction in sign language for parents at its center in Manhattan, his shoulders slumped when he realized that his mother, who works as a baby sitter, could not afford the subway ride from Brooklyn.Last month, one young woman told Lynn Moser, a social worker at the center, that she was being beaten at home. Ms. Moser spoke to the authorities, who found her a safe foster home. ''I have somebody to look out for me here,'' the young woman said in a high-pitched, broken voice, ''and they keep me safe.''She was one of many youngsters who cooked homemade ethnic dishes and carried them to the center on Saturday. Those dishes -- curried chicken, spanish rice, and sweet potatoes with marshmallows, raisins and maple syrup -- were not customary Thanksgiving fare but were part of the Thanksgiving tradition of different cultures sharing their heritages.''I want other people to know my culture and to taste my food,'' said David Ramsingh, a 15-year-old from Trinidad. David was especially proud of his curried chicken, because he had bought the ingredients with money he earned himself, stocking shelves at the Gap.When the feast began, everyone leapt to their feet, paper plates in hand, and hustled around the table. They plucked barbecued ribs from a pan, spooned stuffing from a big bowl, and let their cups run over with Pepsi.They left no doubt that they were regular teen-agers: they finished in 15 minutes, and the pot of mixed vegetables went untouched.HOW TO HELPChecks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund should be sent to P.O.

In the general population, including Jews, roughly 1 in 1,000 children is born deaf, half from hereditary deafness. The new research simply identified a particular genetic mutation that is more common among deaf Jewish people than among deaf people from other backgrounds.The finding is one of several recent advances that make it possible to offer genetic tests to help people determine why they are deaf and to confirm a diagnosis of deafness in infants too young for hearing tests.But the research is controversial, because it means that fetuses can also be tested, raising the possibility that some parents might choose abortion rather than give birth to a child who cannot hear. In addition, some Jewish people fear that genetic studies involving Jews will stigmatize them by creating the false impression that they are more prone than others to hereditary disease.In the report being published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, scientists studied deaf and hearing members of three large Ashkenazi Jewish families, two from the United States and one from Belgium. Ashkenazi Jews are descended from ancestors in Eastern and Central Europe. The deafness in the families was ''nonsyndromic,'' meaning that it was not associated with any other abnormal symptoms.The study was conducted by scientists from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, Louisiana State University, Michigan State University, the University of Antwerp, Belgium, and New York University.The researchers went to great lengths to preserve the patients' anonymity, concealing the cities they were from and even altering some features of the family trees published in the medical journal, so that no one could tell who the families were. Some family members worried that if it became known that their children might carry genes for deafness, it would be hard to arrange marriages for them, which is the custom among some Orthodox Jewish groups.The researchers looked for mutations in a gene called connexin 26, which was identified in 1997 and linked to 50 percent or more of cases of inherited deafness in Italy and Spain. The gene, which directs the production of a protein that makes up part of the inner ear, is recessive, meaning that carriers, who inherit just one defective copy from a parent, have normal hearing. But those with two flawed copies, one from each parent, have hearing loss that can range from moderate to profound.The connexin 26 gene was also affected in the Jewish patients, but many had a different mutation from those in the Mediterranean.Next, the scientists looked for the new mutation in blood samples from 551 Ashkenazi Jews from New York, and also in other whites, blacks and Asians in the United States, and a group of patients from France. They found it in 4 percent of the Ashkenazi but in none of the other groups.They also looked for the first connexin mutation, which turned up in 3.2 percent of Spaniards and Italians, 0.58 percent of whites and 0.73 percent of Ashkenazi Jews.Dr. Bronya Keats, a geneticist at Louisiana State University who participated in the study, said a test for the gene would probably become available next year.''This is a choice made by an individual,'' Dr. Keats said. ''We can provide the information and counseling. It is your choice as an individual or the parents of a child to make the decision as to how you want to use that information.''Dr. Charles Berlin, director of the Kresge Hearing Research Laboratory at Louisiana State University, who also took part in the study, said that hearing parents who had one deaf child had often asked him about their odds of having another, and about genetic testing. ''I say, 'I can help you, but first think about the implications of the message that you're sending to your deaf child, that his life is not worth living,' '' Dr. Berlin said.Nancy Bloch, executive director of the National Association of the Deaf in Silver Spring, Md., wrote: ''We applaud the great strides made through genetic identification research, however, we do not condone the use of such information for eugenics and related purposes.'' Ms. Bloch, who is deaf, sent her comment by E-mail.Dr. Berlin said he and his colleagues hoped to continue their studies of inherited deafness in Ashkenazi Jews. But some are troubled by such research. Rabbi Moshe David Tendler, a professor of medical ethics at Yeshiva University in New York, said, ''It's giving the impression that the Ashkenazi community is the repository of all bad genes.'' Rabbi Tendler said he considered genetic testing for individuals acceptable but screening of populations to find the incidence of a gene amoral and potentially a source of employment and insurance discrimination against Jews.An Orthodox Jewish organization in Brooklyn, Dor Yeshorim, has already received requests for genetic testing from families in which deafness occurs, said the organization's director, Rabbi Josef Ekstein. The goal of the group is to provide testing for genetic disorders to young people before they even begin dating, to help them avoid marriages that might produce children with severe genetic diseases. Rabbi Ekstein said he was not sure yet whether Dor Yeshorim would offer testing for deafness genes as part of its program.Dr. Kathleen Arnos, a medical geneticist at Gallaudet University, a college for the deaf in Washington, said that the university had offered free testing for the first connexin mutation since last spring and that she expected that Gallaudet would also test for the second one among Ashkenazi Jews when the test becomes available. Blood is drawn at the university and sent for analysis to either the National Institutes of Health or the Medical College of Virginia. About 50 people have been tested so far, including students and members of the public.''Within the deaf community, there's a variety of people with different feelings,'' Dr. Arnos said. Many find genetic tests threatening, she said, and think prenatal diagnosis will be used to eliminate future generations of deaf children.''But a lot are excited to get personal information about why they're deaf,'' Dr. Arnos said, ''a satisfaction of their intellectual curiosity about why they are the way they are.''Many are also interested in finding out the odds of their children being deaf. Some have even expressed an interest in finding spouses with the gene to make sure their children will be deaf. Still others want children who can hear.''The biggest group is in the middle and doesn't care either way,'' Dr. Arnos said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/11/movies/families-joined-divided-silence-film-shed-light-emotional-issues-deaf.html", "headline": "Families Joined or Divided by Silence; Film Shed Light on Emotional Issues of the Deaf", "date": "1998-06-11T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from June 11, 1998, Section E, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.A fierce thunderstorm rips through the night and wakens the little girl at the beginning of ''Beyond Silence,'' a new movie by the German director Caroline Link about the hearing child of two deaf parents. Night noises are the child's noises, heard only by the children of the deaf while their parents sleep on. The little girl runs to wake her mother and father, seeking comfort. ''Lightning is loud,'' the father says, in sign language. ''Lightning is silent, like the moon,'' the little girl responds.Ninety percent of deaf parents have children with normal hearing, and ''Beyond Silence,'' which was nominated for an Academy Award this year for best foreign film, is a story of the conflict between isolation and belonging that occurs so often in such families. In his review of the film in The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised it as ''a powerful metaphor for the inevitable communication gap between children and parents in even the happiest of homes,'' though he criticized it for having a ''sentimental ending as various estranged characters reconnect in pat, teary-eyed encounters.''In the film, Ms. Link, who is not deaf, touches on some of the most highly charged issues in deaf culture: oral language versus sign language, the role of music, and the hearing children of deaf parents. Lara, played as a little girl by Tatjana Trieb and as a young woman by Sylvie Testud, in effect becomes a parent to her parents, who are played by two of the deaf world's best-known actors, Howie Seago, an American, and Emmanuelle Laborit of France. The child interprets at parent-teacher conferences, often to her own advantage, and with sometimes amusing results. She breaks the news to her father that he won't be getting his Christmas bonus this year.When her aunt, who is not deaf, gives her a clarinet and she takes up the instrument, Lara is caught in the middle of the lifelong conflict between her father and his own parents and siblings, who refuse to communicate with him in sign language, leaving him to catch what he can by reading their lips, and casting him to the margins of family life.''It's a special, unique childhood situation,'' said Ms. Link, who got the idea for the movie after reading an article about a hearing woman who was raised by deaf parents. ''It is sometimes funny because she takes advantage of the situation,'' she said of the little girl in the film. ''At the same time it is too much for her to have to negotiate the world for her parents.''In researching the film, Ms. Link said, she became entranced by the visual power and beauty of sign language. Indeed, one of the film's most compelling scenes is a religious service filmed at the Johann Baptist Church in Munich, with hundreds of deaf worshipers signing the liturgy in unison.In many ways, the movie reflects the life stories of both its principal actors, Ms. Laborit and Mr. Seago.''I was born deaf and proud of it,'' Mr. Seago, 43, said in a recent interview through a sign language interpreter. ''I grew up deaf and I hope I'm going to die deaf,'' he said with a laugh. Mr. Seago is known primarily for his portrayal of the title role in Peter Sellars's production of ''Ajax,'' about the Greek warrior known for his size and strength. And he brings to the role of the father in ''Beyond Silence'' some of Ajax's desolation and isolation.As the deaf father of two hearing sons, Ryan, 12 and Kyle, 8 (his wife can hear), Mr. Seago knows something of the problems that can arise in families with deaf parents and children who have normal hearing.''They have selective deafness,'' Mr. Seago said of his sons, speaking through a sign language interpreter. ''They're only deaf when they want to be. I'll be signing to them and they'll look away when they want to pretend they haven't heard what I'm saying. In public I will look at my sons, they'll interpret for me, but we try not to do that. If we depend on them, they can use that against us. It can become a battleground.''Inherent in the film is the struggle in today's deaf world between advocates of oralism, or teaching the deaf to speak and read lips in the belief that it will help them assimilate more readily, and proponents of sign language, the complex web of gestures which is the hallmark of deaf culture. In Europe, oralism still prevails. In the United States, nearly half the states now recognize American Sign Language as a foreign language, and some school curriculums offer it as a second language. Still, some linguists oppose recognition of Sign, as it is sometimes known, as a true language, arguing that it is an invented form of communication.Mr. Seago, the son of a father with a hearing impairment and a mother who can hear, was brought up in a world where sign language was essentially forbidden. He can speak quite clearly orally, but says he prefers to communicate in Sign because he can express and detect more.''My father,'' like the father in the movie, Mr. Seago said, ''lived in a hearing world. He spoke and lip read. He didn't know sign language.'' Mr. Seago's two brothers suffered from varying degrees of hearing loss, but for the most part, his family communicates orally. ''In a family situation, I'm left out,'' he said.Refusal to Sign As a Family BarrierIn the film Mr. Seago's father and sister also refuse to communicate with him in sign language. In one scene, Mr. Seago's character confronts his sister, whom he feels is stealing his daughter.''You don't sign with me, you don't communicate with me,'' Mr. Seago said, paraphrasing his character's plea to her, which is delivered in a series of impassioned gestures. After a tragic event brings the film to a resolution, the fact that his sister finally speaks to him in Sign ''is a form of reconciliation,'' he said.The shooting of ''Beyond Silence'' was something of a festival of sign language. There are hundreds of different sign languages, almost as many as there are spoken languages. For the production, Mr. Seago, who speaks American Sign, and Ms. Laborit, who speaks French Sign Language (Langue des Signes Francaise), both had to learn German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebarden Sprache).Off camera, Ms. Laborit and Mr. Seago were able to communicate fairly easily. American Sign Language is partly derived from the French because of the historical connection between the two. In the 19th century, Paris was the center of deaf education, and in 1816, when Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded the first school for the deaf in Connecticut, he invited a French deaf teacher, Laurent Clerc, to teach his students how to sign.Like Mr. Seago, Ms. Laborit, 26, was born deaf. ''My parents were shocked,'' she said in an interview, through an interpreter. But later investigation revealed that Ms. Laborit had had deaf ancestors. Despite France's tradition of sign language, oralism was the dominant mode of communication among the deaf when she was growing up. Only in 1991 was a law passed in France giving children the right to choose between oralist or sign language education. Initially, doctors urged Ms. Laborit's parents to give her hearing aids and to teach her to speak orally.Deaf Center Brings a Revelation''They said, 'Don't let her meet deaf people,' '' Ms. Laborit said. ''They said, 'They'll contaminate her with their sign language.' '' But when she was 7, her mother took her to a program at a deaf cultural center in Vincennes, a suburb of Paris. ''I saw all that signing. I was dumbfounded.'' The whole family learned to sign together, Ms. Laborit said.In the movie, Ms. Laborit, as the mother, is able to accept her daughter's breaking away from the family to play music. At one point she tells her husband: ''Accept your child the way she is. You don't own her.''Ms. Link, who also wrote the script for the film, envisions the mother's character as having had ''a pretty happy and healthy childhood. She was accepted for the way she is. And she could accept others.'' Indeed Ms. Laborit moves through the film as a radiant presence, blithely unaware of her daughter's music.Music has always been the cultural boundary between the hearing and the deaf. At one point, the daughter describes the music she is playing on the clarinet as ''joyful and wild, and at the same time sad and not really free.'' ''It is a description of her situation,'' said Millie Brother, the founder of Children of Deaf Adults (CODA), an organization of the hearing children of deaf parents. ''Music is a culturally charged topic in the deaf community. A lot of people see the loss of music as a sadness for deaf people, but some deaf people see music as not really needed.''It is no accident, said Ms. Brother, that her organization is named after a musical term, CODA, a passage at the end of a composition that relates back to themes that came before but is slightly altered, bringing the work to a close.In the end, said Ms. Link, the director, the subject of ''Beyond Silence'' is not just deafness. ''It's about family communication. It's about a girl who wants to leave home.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/05/nyregion/new-york-to-teach-deaf-in-sign-language-then-english.html", "headline": "New York to Teach Deaf in Sign Language, Then English", "date": "1998-03-05T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from March 5, 1998, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.In what is being hailed as a landmark change in the education of deaf students, the city's only public school for the deaf will be overhauled so that all teachers will teach primarily in a sign language based on symbols and gestures, rather than an English-like sign language based on sounds, or other methods like lip-reading and pointing.Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew will take direct control of the school, now called Junior High School 47 but extending from pre-kindergarten to 10th grade, with a planned expansion to 12th. It is at 225 East 23d Street, at Second Avenue, in Gramercy Park.With the move, to be announced today, New York City, the nation's largest school system, is embracing an approach that has gained currency among many educators and advocates for the deaf. They say that research shows that the primary language of deaf people is visual, not verbal, and that schools using their preferred method, called American Sign Language, educate students better than other schools do.They say deaf students should be treated like bilingual students, not disabled ones. In their view, students first need a primary language -- American Sign Language -- before they learn a second language, in this case, English.The advocacy of bilingual education as a model for deaf people is an integral part of their growing campaign for recognition of a deaf culture with its own rituals and beliefs. Martin Florsheim has been applauded as the first deaf principal in J.H.S. 47's 90-year history.''I think Public School 47 is in the vanguard of a movement,'' said Harlan Lane, a Northeastern University professor who teaches deaf culture and was a consultant to J.H.S. 47. ''The present system, to put it tersely, is a failure. Deaf kids are not getting an education. Deaf kids went into the trades, historically.''But opponents of embracing American Sign Language as the best method contend that it fails to prepare deaf people adequately for a hearing world and that it applies one methodology to a group of people with a wide range of skills.''The idea that you can learn sign language as your first language and it'll solve problems of education and socialization is utter nonsense,'' said Arthur Boothroyd, a Distinguished Professor of speech and learning science at the City University of New York's Graduate Center. ''First of all, A.S.L. is not a written language, which limits access to the world's knowledge. I don't want to decry the value, the beauty or the power of sign language, but the issue is how you go about giving a deaf child what they need to have a satisfying and fulfilling life.''Students at the school will for the first time be offered New York State's college preparatory curriculum and a diploma. Now, many deaf students get a watered-down version of a general education curriculum with modifications, education experts said. Under the new plan, American Sign Language will be used to teach reading and writing English, and all other subjects.''It's an exciting opportunity for a community that needed a chance to acquire the same academic skills provided at any of our other schools,'' Dr. Crew said yesterday.The State Legislature has also set aside extra money to improve the school's crumbling physical condition and train the staff and parents in American Sign Language.The changes are a culmination of three years of study of deaf education by school alumni and experts from across the nation under the direction of Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly's Education Committee.Alumni found that the school had been reflecting the same failures that had left hearing-impaired students behind both academically and socially nationwide. For instance, a 1988 report by the Council on Education of the Deaf, a nonprofit organization that seeks to improve educational opportunities for deaf and hearing-impaired children, found that by the end of 12th grade, children deaf or hard of hearing children were reading on average at a fourth-grade level and doing math at a sixth-grade level.Some advocates for hearing-impaired and deaf people attribute those statistics to efforts by the hearing to force deaf and hearing-impaired people to communicate in the same manner as they do.''They've tried to make us poor imitations of hearing people,'' said Joel Goldfarb, president of the J.H.S. 47 alumni association, who is deaf and spoke through an interpreter. ''No matter how they try, we'll remain deaf.''There has been research since the 1960's supporting the idea that American Sign Language is a separate language, with its own grammar and syntax. The basis of the language is gestural symbols that represent whole words or even sentences. The shape of the hands, speed and direction and the movement of face, head and body are part of the language. Raised eyebrows, for example, can mean a question.Like J.H.S. 47, many schools for the deaf and hard of hearing use a combination of informal sign language, lip reading, American Sign Language, captions and amplification. New York State does not require teachers of the deaf and hard of hearing to know sign language, an issue Mr. Sanders plans to address.''It is the first public school that will grant a diploma with the same standards that we grant the rest of the population,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''The teachers will have the ability to instruct at the pace of the students, which means they have to communicate in the language of A.S.L., which is the language of deaf people.''There are 4,000 to 5,000 children in New York City who are hard of hearing or deaf, Mr. Florsheim estimated. Most attend special programs in mainstream schools, and some are enrolled in special state-supported schools, like the Lexington School for the Deaf in Queens.There are an estimated half-million to one million deaf people in the United States and about 20 million with severe hearing impairment.Junior High School 47 has 277 students, and the expansion will make room for an additional 25 to 40 students, Mr. Florsheim said.A handful of state-supported schools in places like California and Indiana have taken the lead in using American Sign Language as the language of instruction. Charter schools in Minnesota and Colorado that use A.S.L. primarily have been started in the last five or six years.''Deaf children tended historically to be viewed as defective beings who needed to be fixed without regard to deaf children's preferred language, which is American Sign Language,'' said Russell Rosen, a Columbia University specialist in deaf education who prepared the 1996 report that went to Steven Sanders. ''Deaf children could not understand their hearing teachers, which has produced failure after failure.''In 1867, all 26 schools for the deaf in the United States used A.S.L. By 1907, all 139 such schools had forbidden its use in an effort to make the deaf more like hearing people. Instead, they were taught to read lips or to speak. New York's embrace of American Sign Language reflects a pendulum swing back.''There is no single method by which all deaf kids can be educated,'' said Keith Muller, executive director of the League for the Hard of Hearing, the nation's oldest and largest hearing rehabilitation and service league. ''I'm supporting the effort to improve the facility for sure and to upgrade the staff -- that's all glorious,'' Mr. Muller said of the changes. ''The question becomes one of diagnosis and placement decisions.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/18/nyregion/woman-pleads-guilty-in-case-of-deaf-mexican-peddlers.html", "headline": "Woman Pleads Guilty in Case Of Deaf Mexican Peddlers", "date": "1997-11-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from November 18, 1997, Section B, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.A woman who prosecutors say helped lead the Queens branch of an operation that forced deaf Mexican immigrants to peddle trinkets in the subways and streets pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiring to violate the constitutional ban on slavery.But another woman who the authorities say was a leader in the Chicago branch of the ring refused yesterday to enter a guilty plea to another conspiracy charge, though prosecutors had expected her to do so. Her lawyer said she refused because the prosecution wanted her to say she had committed acts she insisted she had not.But the plea by the woman in the Queens part of the operation, Rosa Maria Beltran Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who is herself deaf, brought to 11 the number of people who have pleaded guilty to charges in the case. Nearly all of the pleas have been to conspiring to smuggle deaf and mute immigrants into the United States and keep them in forced servitude in two cities, prosecutors say.Ms. Beltran Sanchez faces up to 10 years in prison.A total of 20 people, all but 2 of them Mexican and most of them also deaf and unable to speak, have been indicted on various charges in the case. Of the 9 whose cases are still awaiting resolution, 7 are in jail in New York awaiting trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, while 2 are in custody in Mexico after being arrested there.The operation -- in which investigators say violence and threats were used to force the immigrants to peddle key-chain trinkets for $1 each and to turn over all the proceeds to the ring's bosses -- was discovered in July, when four of the immigrants walked into a Queens police station to report their plight.They led officers to two houses in the borough -- one in Jackson Heights and one in Corona -- that were crammed with about 60 men, women and children, sleeping side by side on bunk beds and mattresses.Subsequent investigation led to what Federal investigators called a similar ''workhouse'' in Chicago, as well as to a house in Los Angeles that the authorities described as a ''safe house'' in which the immigrants, after being smuggled across the border into California, were kept until they were transported to New York and Chicago.The Chicago woman who refused to go through with the plea in Federal Court in Brooklyn yesterday is Norma Alcantara.Ms. Beltran Sanchez, 26, is the first defendant to plead guilty whom prosecutors have described as a leader of the operation, though they say she was not at the highest level of leadership. She and her husband, Jose Paoletti Lemus, a member of the family that the authorities say organized the operation, are said to have run the house in Corona. Mr. Paoletti Lemus is among those awaiting trial.The charge Ms. Beltran Sanchez pleaded guilty to says she conspired from 1993 to July of this year to violate the immigrants' ''right to be free from involuntary servitude.'' Through sign-language interpreters, she pleaded guilty by agreeing with a series of statements that her lawyer, Michael Hurwitz, read before Magistrate Judge Joan M. Azrack.''Threats of violence and violence were used to hold workers against their will and to make sure they worked,'' Mr. Hurwitz said. ''Is that correct?''''Yes,'' the interpreter said after Ms. Beltran Sanchez nodded.''They would be hit if they didn't work or tried to escape,'' Mr. Hurwitz continued. ''Is that correct?''''Yes.''Meanwhile, 57 immigrants who had been kept in the houses in Queens and Chicago -- 48 adult peddlers and 9 of their children -- are being held by immigration officials at a Queens motel, said the prosecutor in the case, Leslie Cornfeld. The adults have been designated potential witnesses.Legislation has been introduced in Congress to permit the illegal immigrants to remain in the country legally. Some of the children were born after their parents arrived in the United States and thus are American citizens."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/06/garden/currents-sign-language-their-regards-to-broadway-times-square-s-light-shows.html", "headline": "Currents; SIGN LANGUAGE -- Their Regards to Broadway: Times Square's Light Shows", "date": "1997-11-06T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from November 6, 1997, Section F, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Mr. Peanut waving his walking stick on Broadway between 46th and 47th Streets.

That spectacular endured until 1966, and the design was so successful that Mr. Leigh repeated it in 12 other cities.In 1945, the lights came back, as if turned on by a single switch, in a huge choreographed ceremony, said Mary Beth Betts, the society's curator of architecture who organized the show.''Spectaculars have had their ups and downs,'' Ms. Betts said, and their fans include advertisers and some members of the public.

Ms. Farias, who scores high in I.Q. tests, says she feels lost and trapped in the classroom. At 15, she reads at a third-grade level.Under Federal law, Ms. Farias is entitled to an education comparable to that of her hearing classmates. City school officials determined that Ms. Farias should remain in a regular classroom aided by a sign language interpreter. Yet, since the school year started, she has had an interpreter just in her social studies class, and only for the past few weeks.''I'm wasting my time,'' Ms. Farias said in an interview, aided by an interpreter. ''My teachers try to sign a little bit, and they talk to me and ask me, 'Can you hear me?' But I can't.''Yesterday, school officials decided to send Ms. Farias to the New York School for the Deaf, a state-supported private school in White Plains that uses both speech and sign language in its lessons and where she has been guaranteed an interpreter. But the move is temporary while Ms. Farias awaits a permanent placement.School officials in New York City and around the country have worked to place many deaf and otherwise disabled students in regular classes, in some cases with aides for the teachers. For the deaf students, the other options have been either sending them to a school for the deaf in the city or to a specialized school elsewhere, which is the goal of Ms. Farias's parents.Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, said Ms. Farias is one of 15 hearing-impaired students in classrooms all over the city who school officials have determined need interpreters, but do not have one. ''This is an area in which, unfortunately, the need certainly exceeds the supply,'' she said. ''And now, we just can't meet our needs.''However, school officials cautioned, the decision to send Ms. Farias to the specialized school in White Plains does not mean that other students who need interpreters will also be sent there. Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, they said.School officials say they are saddened, even embarrassed, that they are unable to provide interpreters for all the students who need them. But, they point out, local agencies they use to hire interpreters are themselves having a tough time meeting the demand.The Board of Education employs 59 interpreters for 85 hearing-impaired students, but only 35 of the interpreters are full-time employees of the school system and they do not work as classroom interpreters all the time.Irma Azrelyant, an owner of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Interpreting Services, one of the agencies used by the Board of Education, said interpreters do not want to work long hours every day, interpreting lessons for students.Barbara Kannapell, a social linguist based in Washington, said the shortage of sign-language interpreters is a national problem. ''I have heard horror stories from deaf students who went through mainstream schools without interpreters,'' Dr. Kannapell said. ''They sit there wasting their time, having trouble following their teachers or not following at all.''In Chicago and in Los Angeles, school officials said they have been able to provide sign-language interpreters for all students who need them, but they have had a shortage of interpreters and have been studying ways to increase their salaries . Ms. Crowe said a Board of Education task force has been created to address the same problem.For months, Ms. Farias's parents have argued that she and her 13-year-old sister, Dolly, who is hearing-impaired, have not been receiving an adequate education in New York City.Rodolfo and Dolores Farias want the Board of Education to pay the cost of sending their daughters to the Maryland School for the Deaf. Tuition at that school can be more than $40,000 per school year, city school officials say, while the average cost of educating a special needs child in New York is about half that.In Maryland, the Fariases argue, the girls would not need interpreters. They would be taught all their subjects by teachers who know American Sign Language, which is considered a foreign language in many states and is the language that the Farias sisters know best. That approach -- using American Sign Language while learning to read and write in English -- is not available in New York City for students beyond first grade, city school officials say.Six months ago, the Fariases asked for a Board of Education hearing on their daughters' placements. So far, school officials have refused to send the Farias sisters to Maryland, arguing that their education has been adequate. Dolly, who attends Junior High School 190 in Forest Hills, Queens, has been lucky enough to get an interpreter.School officials would not offer details of the hearing, citing confidentiality issues. But interviews with the Fariases' lawyer, Barry J. Schindler, as well as transcripts from the hearings, show that school officials have been forced to defend their decision to keep Ms. Farias in a regular classroom with an interpreter while acknowledging that they have been unable to fulfill that recommendation.Yesterday's decision to send Ms. Farias to the school in White Plains did not please the Fariases. While it solved the immediate problem by providing an interpreter for Ms. Farias, it does not address the larger issue of whether she should remain in a city school or be transferred to a specialized school, Mr. Schindler said. Nevertheless, he said, the family will have to comply with the decision for now.''What are we to do?'' said Mr. Schindler, a lawyer with Morgan & Finnegan, the firm that represents the Fariases. ''Keep her there, wasting her time while they look for an interpreter they have already admitted they can't find?''Mr. Schindler said city school officials do not want to send Ms. Farias to the Maryland School for the Deaf because of the expense and because they fear that other parents of deaf children might attempt to force the Board of Education to pay for their children's schooling at specialized schools outside the system.Dov Rokeach, superintendent of clinical services for the city's schools, would not discuss Ms. Farias's case, but he said the issue of money does not factor into decisions about placement of deaf students. The school system spends more than $6 million a year to send 222 students with special needs to schools outside New York. One attends Maryland School for the Deaf, because school officials deemed it appropriate in that case, he said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/16/nyregion/metro-news-briefs-new-york-city-representative-plans-bill-to-aid-deaf-immigrants.html", "headline": "Representative Plans Bill To Aid Deaf Immigrants", "date": "1997-09-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from September 16, 1997, Section B, Page 6Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Representative Nydia M.

The captioning, synchronized manually with Christopher Plummer's Tony-winning performance, will scroll in red letters on a small digital screen in front of a side section of the orchestra, where 150 people can be seated.The Theater Access Project of the Theater Development Fund said the Sept. 24 performance would be the first on Broadway to offer the service. The organization, which served as an advocate for the use of the device and will pay its developer for his services, announced that the captioning will be used later in the season when it takes school groups and others to performances of ''Jekyll and Hyde'' at the Plymouth Theater and ''The King and I'' at the Neil Simon.''Our anticipation is this will open up a whole new audience,'' said Lisa Carling of the Theater Access Project. ''There has been such enthusiasm from people who haven't been able to go to the theater before.''The Theater Access Project was established in 1979 to make theatergoing possible for potential audience members previously barred by disabilities. Ms. Carling said the captioning box was developed by a court stenographer, Don DePew of Manhattan, after Arlene Romoff of Ridgewood, N.J., an advocate for the deaf, expressed regret that her own hearing loss prevented her from enjoying theater by means of the infrared listening devices available in many theaters.The Theater Development Fund said some 28 million Americans are deaf or hard of hearing, and of these, only a small percentage understand American Sign Language and can benefit from interpreted performances of Broadway shows.

But they are continuing to investigate less formal ties, including allegations from at least one of the victims that the leaders of an operation in Chicago -- which had strong ties to New York -- had visited North Carolina last summer.''We know there's a link,'' said one immigration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''What we are still investigating is what the link was, and what it meant.''On Monday, Walter C.

They are accused of running two houses in Sanford, N.C., in which they and 14 other people, including several children, were discovered on July 25.Conditions in the houses in Sanford, a small town roughly 35 miles southwest of Raleigh, were described as better than those in Jackson Heights, Queens, where the police found 62 people crammed into two apartments on July 19. Twenty people have been charged with running a ring to exploit other deaf immigrants centered in New York City, with an arm in Chicago and a smuggling operation in Los Angeles.Mr. Campos and Ms. Palencia were charged with conspiracy to violate Federal immigration laws, inducing illegal immigrants to come to the United States and harboring and transporting illegal immigrants."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/21/nyregion/us-indictment-describes-abuses-of-deaf-mexican-trinket-sellers.html", "headline": "U.S. Indictment Describes Abuses Of Deaf Mexican Trinket Sellers", "date": "1997-08-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from August 21, 1997, Section A, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.A Federal indictment unsealed yesterday painted the most complete -- and graphic -- picture yet of what prosecutors say was a cross-country operation to force deaf Mexican immigrants to sell $1 trinkets, including disclosures that ringleaders used electric shocks on one peddler who did not sell enough trinkets, slammed another's head against a wall and chained a third to a bed for a week.The operation's techniques, as described in the indictment against 20 people, were effective. For the first time, prosecutors gave an estimate of the ring's revenue, placing it at $1 million a year over five years.The 11-count indictment was also significant because it seemed to indicate that the operation, which prosecutors say was run by an extended clan of deaf people from Mexico City, was not as widespread as initially feared when it was uncovered last month in Queens. The ring, though believed to be the largest of its kind, appears to have been limited to New York City and Chicago, with a separate group in Los Angeles of people who smuggled deaf immigrants into the country, according to law enforcement officials.''The operation has largely been dismantled,'' said Leslie Cornfeld, an assistant United States Attorney who is a prosecutor on the case. ''The leaders of this operation have now been arrested and charged, including the ringleaders in three major cities throughout the country.''But investigators provided an intriguing explanation for why other cities appeared to have similar rings of deaf peddlers. The indictment said the Paoletti family, which ran the New York City operation, forced peddlers from New York to take day trips out of town to work. The ringleaders would take them to and from cities like Philadelphia, Washington and Boston so they could earn yet more money selling the trinkets.Zachary W. Carter, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, also said there appeared to be no link between the operation in New York and a smaller ring in North Carolina, also shut down last month.Since the operation was shut down on July 19, Federal investigators had provided few details about it. The indictment released yesterday began to flesh out a world that few New Yorkers knew existed, expanding on the conditions of virtual slavery described by two of the peddlers who exposed the operation when they walked into a police precinct in Queens.The incident shocked the city, and Federal investigators worked in the following weeks to arrest 18 suspects from coast to coast, ranging from people who smuggled the peddlers in to those who reportedly administered regular beatings. Two others -- a father and son described as the two main leaders -- were arrested in Mexico City two weeks ago, and officials in New York are seeking their extradition.The indictment still provides only limited details about an operation prosecutors say may have stretched back to 1988. But it begins to sketch out specific acts of cruelty which, combined with the threats from the ringleaders to turn peddlers over the immigration officials, may have been what kept the operation running for so long and so profitably.This past spring, the indictment alleges, Renato Paoletti Lemus and Adriana Paoletti Lemus, the brother and sister who were leaders of two Queens houses where many of the peddlers lived, administered electric shocks to a 25-year-old peddler because he did not sell enough trinkets. In roughly the same time, the indictment says, Mr. Paoletti handcuffed a 30-year-old man to a bed for a week, forcing him to make trinkets that would later be sold on the street. In another case, the indictment describes a woman being punished for leaving the house in Jackson Heights by having her head smashed into a wall.The indictment also alleges that other peddlers were beaten for trying to escape or for not turning all their money over to the bosses at the end of the day.According to the indictment, another victim claimed that Mr. Paoletti's brother, Jose, threatened to kill him if he told the police about conditions in the two houses of peddlers run by the Paolettis in Jackson Heights, Queens.At a news conference in Brooklyn yesterday, Federal and city officials described the crimes in the indictment in tones of outrage.''Every case of slavery is terrible, but what's especially appalling about today's case is the double exploitation,'' said Isabelle Katz Pinzler, Acting Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice. ''The victims were targeted both because they were aliens and because they were people with disabilities.''But Samuel Gregory, a lawyer for one of the defendants, Santa Gonzalez Refugio, said the lines between victims and bosses may not be as clear as prosecutors portray. Though he said it was extraordinarily difficult to communicate with his client -- a problem that investigators also say hampered them -- it appeared that people like Ms. Gonzalez, the girlfriend of one of the Paolettis, did not play a major role.''When she came here she had nothing,'' Mr. Gregory said. ''When she was arrested she still had nothing. I'm sure the relationships between these people as individuals arecomplex and that to understand this entire scenario is a difficult undertaking.''The indictment, which covers only the time between 1993 and 1997, portrays a complicated arrangement in which the Paolettis did not bring people from Mexico, where the deaf often live as outcasts, to the United States by kidnapping them, as some investigators initially thought. The indictment alleges that recruiters promised them ''prosperous jobs and life styles'' if they left Mexico.The peddlers were then smuggled into California, often through Tijuana, to a way station run by smugglers in Los Angeles. From there, they were taken either to New York City or to Chicago, where prosecutors say a long-time friend of the Paoletti family, Norma Alcantara, ran a similar and related operation. Relations between Chicago and New York were so close, the indictment alleges, that peddlers were traded back and forth, as they sold trinkets on the streets and subways often seven days a week.The charges include conspiracy to violate civil rights laws against involuntary servitude, extortion, alien smuggling and illegal transportation of aliens. The indictment did not include sexual abuse charges, though investigators have said several women appeared to have been sexually abused.Mr. Carter said, ''That's a matter still under investigation, as is the entire enterprise.''''We expect that as a result of the investigation there may be further charges added,'' he said.All 18 of the defendants in the United States are being held in Brooklyn, and are scheduled to appear in court for arraignment on Sept. 3."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/13/nyregion/deaf-immigrant-once-classified-as-a-victim-is-now-a-suspect.html", "headline": "Deaf Immigrant, Once Classified As a Victim, Is Now a Suspect", "date": "1997-08-13T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from August 13, 1997, Section B, Page 6Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.For weeks, agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service had considered Juan Contreras Rauda one of the victims in a scheme to smuggle deaf immigrants from Mexico and force them to sell trinkets on the streets of Chicago.Yesterday, Federal authorities painted a starkly different portrait of Mr. Contreras Rauda. In a complaint filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he was accused of helping to smuggle deaf immigrants from Mexico, shuttling them from Chicago to New York, collecting their earnings at the end of each day and beating them if they did not bring back enough money.Like nearly all the others arrested in the smuggling ring in Chicago, New York and Mexico City over the last four weeks, Mr. Contreras Rauda, 29, who is also deaf, is in this country illegally, said Russ Bergeron, an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman.Mr. Contreras Rauda pleaded not guilty. He is being held at the Federal detention center in Brooklyn.Mr. Contreras Rauda had been in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at a hotel in Chicago since late July, when Federal authorities discovered him among a group of seven deaf Mexican immigrants living in an apartment. Yesterday, immigration agents brought him to New York City, where he was arrested by Federal officials.Their complaint is based on the testimony of two unidentified informers who were among the deaf Mexicans illegally smuggled into this country. According to the complaint, one of the informers said Mr. Contreras Rauda helped Norma Alcantara, who was arrested in Chicago last month on charges of smuggling immigrants, smuggle the informer and other illegal immigrants from Mexico to the United States.The authorities have said in the past that they believe Ms. Alcantara worked under Renato Paoletti Lemus, who has been charged as the mastermind of a nationwide scheme to lure deaf immigrants from Mexico and force them to sell trinkets on the streets and subways of several American cities.The scheme was discovered last month when several of the deaf immigrants in Jackson Heights approached the police and led them to two apartments in Jackson Heights crammed with 57 immigrants. They are all still in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in an Elmhurst motel, because they are here illegally.According to the complaint, Mr. Contreras Rauda transported several deaf immigrants to ''safe houses'' in Queens and ''acted as the boss, supervising their work'' as peddlers in the city's subways.

Witness the case of Knut Hamsun, the Nobel Prize-winning Norwegian novelist and starry-eyed nationalist, who was regarded as a god in his homeland until he took up the Nazi cause during World War II.In ''Hamsun,'' Jan Troell's epic study of the author's fall from grace, Max von Sydow gives a career-crowning performance as the cranky, hearing-impaired writer who marched to a different political drum from most of his countrymen. An ardent Norwegian nationalist who swallowed whole Hitler's bombastic prophecies of a new European order in which Norway would emerge as a major player on the international stage, Hamsun heard only what he wanted to hear in this rabble-rousing rhetoric. He supported the Nazi occupation government and urged young men in the resistance to abandon their cause.Hamsun's advanced age and his Olympian isolation from the everyday world had a lot to do with his disastrous miscalculation. He was already in his 70's when Hitler came to power, and because he had never read ''Mein Kampf,'' he appears to have been unaware of Hitler's rabid anti-Semitism. The movie, which opens today at the Film Forum, touches only glancingly on the themes of his nature-loving writing, which partook of the same nostalgia for a purified, agrarian utopia as one side of the German fascist vision.Hamsun and the Nazis shared a common enemy in Britain. To Hamsun, British imperialism was a world-destroying evil force, and he argued passionately in editorials and speeches that Britain must be crushed at all costs.But this two-and-a-half-hour film, based on a book by Thorkild Hansen, is more than just a complex study of a politically self-deluded genius. It digs deeply into the seams and cracks of Hamsun's tormented marriage to his wife, Marie (Ghita Norby), a writer of children's books who was an even more avid supporter of the Nazi cause than her husband. In Per Olov Enquist's psychologically probing screenplay, the couple's rancorous quarrels resound with a deep-seated bitterness that recalls the domestic strife portrayed in Ingmar Bergman's ''Scenes From a Marriage.''As a family man, the film finds Hamsun fitting the familiar mode of the detached, self-involved intellectual. The author was too consumed by his own thoughts and visions to be a faithful husband or a caring father. But if his wife had the spirit to fight back, his children, at once awestruck and resentful at his neglect, suffered. One daughter, Ellinor (Anette Hoff), became a mentally disturbed alcoholic.The story begins in 1935 and follows Hamsun's deepening commitment to the Nazis, who cynically exploited him as a high-culture poster boy for their cause. His involvement builds to a climactic meeting with Hitler (Ernst Jacobi) at the Fuhrer's mountain retreat. The egotistical Hamsun imagines the encounter as comparable to a meeting between Goethe and Napoleon. But an initially cordial exchange turns ugly when Hamsun presses his nationalistic agenda and Hitler loses patience and stomps out of the room.After the war, instead of being jailed for treason, Hamsun is sent to a mental hospital where he is examined by a psychiatrist (Erik Hivju) and as part of his treatment is shown movies of the Nazi concentration camps that leave him weeping and shaken. These scenes portray his official psychiatric treatment as a sinister, voyeuristic process that strips the elderly author of his dignity and self-worth with the bogus aim of trying to explain his artistic creativity. Ultimately Hamsun is tried for his crimes and fined $80,000 for ''economic collaboration.'' Testifying in his own defense, he babbles on about how his vision of a ''new Norway'' made him ''ecstatic'' and pleads weakly, ''Nobody told me what I was writing was wrong.'' He insists he has made peace with himself.Mr. von Sydow's Hamsun is one of the most extraordinarily rich and moving portrayals of an older person ever filmed. The film spans 17 years, until Hamsun's death in 1952, and as it goes along, the actor seems literally to shrink and wither as the years take their toll. What keeps him going is a driving mental energy that he pours into a final work, the memoir ''Overgrown Paths,'' which his Norwegian publisher refuses to print for political reasons when Marie first presents it to him.Ms. Norby's Marie is as intense and complicated as Mr. von Sydow's Hamsun. Fiercely angry at her husband, she is also fiercely loyal to and ultimately loves this man whom she matches in stubborn willpower and spirit. The Hamsuns were the last people in the world you would call a fun couple. If ''life is strife,'' as Gertrude Stein once said, their marriage embodied life at its fullest.HAMSUNDirected by Jan Troell; written (in Swedish, Danish and Norwegian, with English subtitles) by Per Olov Enquist, based on the book ''Processen mod Hamsun'' by Thorkild Hansen; director of photography, Mr. Troell; edited by Ghita Beckendorff and Mr. Troell; music by Arvo Part, Johann Strauss and Richard Wagner; produced by Erik Crone; released by First Run Features.

Nor had officials determined whether a group of trinket peddlers in North Carolina was associated with the other two.Mr. Limon-Sosa is among 11 people arrested since July 19 in the peddling operations. On that day, the police raided two houses in Queens, finding 57 people, most of them deaf illegal immigrants from Mexico who were forced to sell key chains and other trinkets on the subways. Last weekend, two people, one deaf, were arrested in Chicago in the peddling ring there.Law enforcement officials said they were exploring leads to possible operations in other cities, though it seemed clear they were still trying to determine how extensive, lucrative and sophisticated the operations in New York, Chicago and North Carolina were. ''We're still trying to figure out what's a real operation or just a set of circumstances where people are being rotated in and out,'' said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In Chicago yesterday, a Federal magistrate ordered the three people arrested there to New York.

Giuliani and the City Council reached a hard-won compromise to shrink the city's fire alarm box system, a Federal judge ruled yesterday that the plan violated the civil rights of the city's 65,000 deaf and hearing-impaired residents.The ruling means that the system, the subject of a contentious three-year battle between the Mayor and the City Council, will remain virtually unchanged. The decision, by Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court in Manhattan, dealt with only a small part of the alarm box system.Four months ago, the city's lawyers announced that they would no longer fight the court challenge brought by advocates for the deaf, and would not remove or alter the vast majority of the boxes.In yesterday's ruling, Judge Sweet ordered the city to refit about 2,000 boxes that were part of an experiment in 1995 in which the city removed or disconnected some boxes to judge the effect on their neighborhoods, as a way to persuade the Council to scrap the system. An estimated 12,261 fire boxes remained untouched.When the suit was filed last year by the advocates for the deaf, the city began to reconnect many of those boxes, but with a single line to the Police Department instead of the familiar two-button box system that has lines to both the Police and Fire Departments. The Fire Department contended that the single-line boxes would drastically cut down on false alarms, because callers would be more likely to summon a police car if they hung up without explanation.Judge Sweet said the one-button boxes were ''unusable'' by a hearing-impaired person, a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which guarantees equal access to public services. Advocates for the deaf said that shrinking the system or converting to one-button boxes would make it more difficult for the deaf to report emergencies.Citing a study conducted by the city in September 1996, the ruling said that 27 of 33 hearing-impaired callers who used the one-button boxes were unable to report emergencies.Franklin Siegel, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights who, along with Robert B. Stulberg, represented the plaintiffs, called the decision an important victory. ''The city has to take people with disabilities into account when it modifies or designs city services,'' Mr. Siegel said.Michael Regan, the deputy fire commissioner for public information, said that officials were disappointed that Judge Sweet did not recognize that the city's one-button plan would have been an improvement over the two-button system and cut down on false alarms.An aide to the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said that Mr. Vallone had not received the decision yesterday and could not comment.A year ago in April, the City Council and Mr. Giuliani had reached a compromise in the Mayor's three-year battle to abolish the fire box system entirely. The two sides agreed to keep virtually all the boxes in poor neighborhoods while those in other parts of the city would be reduced by half. Then lawyers for the hearing-impaired entered the battle.The plaintiffs had asked the judge to order the city to reconnect hundreds of boxes that were disconnected in the pilot area, but he refused, saying it would cost the city about $5.4 million."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/23/nyregion/conflicting-view-emerges-of-family-linked-to-deaf.html", "headline": "Conflicting View Emerges Of Family Linked to Deaf", "date": "1997-07-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 23, 1997, Section A, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.Jose Paoletti Moreda forged his empire from the innocence of the silent ones. He is a charming but silent salesman who makes his pitch with his hands. He is a smooth Latin dancer although he cannot hear the music.The patriarch of the family accused by United States prosecutors of forcing deaf Mexican immigrants to sell trinkets on the subways and streets of New York City, Mr. Paoletti Moreda built a family business over the past decade based on a work force of vendors recruited from Mexico's deaf population, the officials say.The Paolettis brought to their enterprise the drive of the small shopkeeper, the guile of the alien smuggler and, occasionally, the back-of-the-hand fury of the sweatshop foreman, according to interviews with people here who are familiar with the operation.Mr. Paoletti Moreda, 59, his wife, Delia, and their three children, Adriana, Jose and Renato -- all of them deaf -- transferred to the United States a business plied by other deaf people in Mexico City for decades: peddling trinkets in the streets and subways. The trinkets that sold for pesos in Mexico fetched dollars in the United States.The profits allowed the Paolettis to rise from lower-middle-class roots in Mexico and acquire homes in New York and Los Angeles and a fleet of vehicles, their acquaintances say. Using pictures of their possessions as enticements, they recruited scores of other deaf Mexicans to cross illegally into the United States as vendors in their silent sales force, according to interviews with law enforcement officials and relatives of some vendors.Four members of the Paoletti clan were arrested in New York on a variety of state and Federal charges after 57 deaf immigrants were found living in two apartments in Queens: Delia, Adriana, 29, Jose, 28, and a cousin, Alfredo Rustrian Paoletti, who is Mr. Paoletti Moreda's nephew.Law enforcement officials are also seeking Renato, the family's youngest son, who is about 20, and is described as a ringleader. His girlfriend, Santa Gonzalez, and Jose's wife, Rosa Maria Beltran-Sanchez, were also arrested in New York, along with Raul Alanis, who is not related to them.It was not clear whether the authorities in Mexico were looking for Mr. Paoletti Moreda, but Delia Garcia, 22, who spent seven months working for the Paolettis in New York in 1994, said she saw him in Mexico City last week at a basketball game for the deaf.As investigators in the United States begin to piece together the case against the Paolettis, the neighbors, teachers, and Mexican relatives of the deaf workers recruited by the Paolettis offer descriptions of the family that often contrast with their portrayal as ruthless profiteers.''These are fine people with great hearts,'' said Griselda Espinosa Chavez, a teacher in Mexico City's special education system who taught the three Paoletti children and knew their parents well. ''They were fighting to get ahead. They loved money and wanted a higher status.''Acquaintances have described the roles the Paolettis played: the brilliant daughter who recruited her deaf chums from her days in Mexico City's special education schools, the attractive son who learned to manage the street sales force at his father's elbow, the beguiling and often duplicitous patriarch who arranged the illegal border crossings and managed the money.Mr. Paoletti Moreda was born with full hearing, but lost it during his youth when he contracted measles, said Clara Munoz, who was a neighbor to the Paolettis in Mexico City's lower-middle-class Tacubaya sector during the 1970's. Delia was born deaf, and so were her three children, Ms. Munoz said.As an artist in Mexico's Communications Ministry for most of his adult life, sketching roads and airports, Mr. Paoletti Moreda earned a comfortable living. His three children attended special education public schools, but also received private instruction in communication and computer programming.''We knew the Paolettis as los burgueses, the bourgeoisie, of the neighborhood,'' Ms. Munoz said. She said that Mr. Paoletti Moreda's well-maintained Volkswagen, the children's private classes, and the parties that they gave in their apartment for neighbors -- where Mr. Paoletti Moreda displayed his dancing -- made them seem more affluent than others in the neighborhood. Socorro Paoletti, Mr. Paoletti Moreda's sister, was married to a Dr. Rustrian, a general practitioner whose income allowed the family to put Alfredo and two other children through private schools.The Paoletti children were considered studious. Adriana was outstanding, graduating from high school with a 9.6 grade point average on a 10-point scale.About the time of Mr. Paoletti Moreda's retirement as an artist in the last decade, he moved his family to an apartment in a gritty industrial suburb of Mexico City, and the family also began to travel widely in the United States.In late 1988, Adriana visited Agustin Rodriguez Torres, a deaf boy who she knew from their days in special education. She invited him and his sister, Veronica, to her family's apartment, where Adriana and her father described dazzling travels across the United States. Mr. Paoletti Moreda said he had started a business making and selling keyrings, and told Agustin it was easy to make money north of the border.''He said we all worked too hard, for too little, in Mexico,'' Veronica recalled in an interview. They convinced Agustin, who was earning about $4 a day here as a laborer and felt that deaf people are treated better in the United States than in Mexico. After his visit to the Paolettis, he told his family he was going to the United States. ''He said that by working less than he was in Mexico he'd be able to buy a car, and that's how they won his heart,'' his sister said.When the Paolettis took Agustin to the United States in 1989, they traveled by bus to Tijuana and then crossed the border illegally to Los Angeles, his sister said. In more recent years, the Paolettis have flown their recruits to Tijuana and in some cases to Ciudad Juarez, according to relatives of other recruits. Mr. Paoletti Moreda has boasted to his recruits that he knows Government officials working on both sides of the border who can arrange the illegal crossing, the relatives said.For two years the Rodriguez family did not hear from Agustin. Then a woman called the Rodriguez residence here, without giving her name, to say Agustin was being exploited.''She told us the Paolettis were holding Agustin hostage, that he was sick and didn't have enough to eat, that they sometimes hit him,'' Veronica said.The call stunned the Rodriguez family. Several months later, Mr. Paoletti Moreda traveled to Mexico, and Veronica confronted him with the reports. ''He said it was all a lie, that Agustin was getting fat and saving a lot of money, that Agustin soon would be able to buy a car,'' Veronica said. ''But I didn't believe it. I wanted to hit him.''The Paolettis at first based their street vending business in Los Angeles, although they sometimes carried recruits elsewhere to sell trinkets in Las Vegas, Miami and other tourist centers. Their decision to establish a New York base appears to have resulted from Adriana's marriage to a deaf postal worker from Long Island, Frank Coenen.The relatives of several deaf vendors recruited by the Paolettis said they received no word from their loved ones, for years, except a series of postcards written in a strange hand carrying saccharine assurances that all was well. The strikingly similar correspondence sent to several families suggests the Paolettis may have organized the letter-writing effort to calm relatives.One who did was Pilar Muniz Rodriguez, who filed kidnapping charges here against Mario Guillen, one of Mr. Paoletti Moreda's employees, accusing him and the Paolettis of forcibly carrying her deaf daughter to New York last year.''Don Paoletti was very nice, but I never trusted him,'' Ms. Muniz said. ''I knew there was something wrong about the way he talked to me.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/21/nyregion/in-mexico-tales-of-deception-confirm-the-fears-of-the-deaf.html", "headline": "In Mexico, Tales of Deception Confirm the Fears of the Deaf", "date": "1997-07-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from July 21, 1997, Section A, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.A Roman Catholic priest who ministers to deaf people summoned his flock to an emergency meeting after morning Mass today in his parish church here. With someone translating in sign language, he warned them about people who seduce deaf Mexicans into traveling to the United States to labor as street vendors.''Look at the papers saying they enslaved deaf people in New York City,'' the Rev. Martin Montoya said, holding aloft local newspapers reporting today on the rescue of 57 deaf Mexican immigrants from abusive employers. ''Be careful with those offering a better life elsewhere, and don't be misled by deceitful promises.''Passing the word through hand signs and lip-reading, thousands of deaf Mexicans shared the stunning story of the deaf immigrants who the police say were held in forced labor in New York. The news aroused considerable alarm, confirming widespread rumors of ill treatment suffered by the thousands of deaf Mexicans who travel to the United States each year to sell trinkets on streets from Los Angeles to Queens.''This gives me an ugly feeling,'' said Juana Martinez, a 39-year-old deaf woman who heard the news during Father Montoya's meeting at the San Hipolito church in downtown Mexico City.The events in New York transfixed not only deaf people; several of the city's largest newspapers led today's editions with the news.''They Enslaved the Deaf Mutes!'' read the headline in La Prensa, a Mexico City tabloid.

Four of those arrested are also members of the Paoletti family, who kept a tyrannical reign over two apartments crowded with deaf Mexicans in Jackson Heights, Queens, officials said.Yesterday morning, 57 of the Mexicans, including 3 pregnant women and 12 young children, ate waffles at the Westway Motor Inn in Elmhurst, Queens, as immigration authorities determined that almost all were illegal immigrants. Although Federal immigration officials had been ready to bus them to a county jail in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani insisted that they remain in New York City custody as crime victims and witnesses.''At least some of the people here have been through a very terrible ordeal that should not happen to anyone,'' the Mayor said after leaving the motel yesterday. ''The allegations are that these people were brought here under false pretense. They were told they would be able to make a living and to live decently here. One man told me that one of the bosses slapped his children. I spoke to one child who had some scars around his eyes from a beating.''Hundreds of other deaf Mexicans have moved north recently to sell trinkets in American cities, driven away by intolerance and drawn north by a perception of greater opportunity, according to the director of the National School for the Deaf in Mexico City. The director, Jose Badilla Huerta, said he had visited small communities of deaf Mexicans in Rochester, Chicago, Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif. Although they are also exploited, he said, he does not know of any enduring the kind of forced-labor conditions that existed in Jackson Heights.In their enforced New York routine, the immigrants would leave their apartments before dawn wearing backpacks filled with a hundred $1 key chains. All day, they crisscrossed the city by train, timidly laying the trinkets down next to subway riders with a card saying, ''I am deaf.'' They said they often worked until midnight because if they returned without $100 in earnings, they would be slapped or punched. They had two days off a month.They did not go completely unnoticed by city authorities. On at least one occasion before Saturday's raid, police officers and city emergency workers went to one of the two apartments to aid a woman who refused their offers of medical attention. On another occasion, a building inspector visited. Nothing came of either incursion into their world.The Federal authorities arrested four Mexicans -- including Alfredo Rustrian Paoletti, 37, whom the immigrants called ''the boss'' -- in Queens on charges of smuggling, transporting and harboring immigrants. The New York police arrested three others on charges that they slapped and punched immigrants who would not work, threatened them with injury and stole their proceeds at day's end.Some of those arrested understood and spoke Spanish. Others appeared to be as deaf and mute as their victims; they apparently served as ''the crew chiefs, or enforcers, who were under the bosses and over the worker bees,'' said Daniel Molerio, an assistant district director for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in New York. The enforcers appeared to be living with the immigrants; some $30,000 in cash was found in one of the apartments.The criminal charges followed nearly 24 hours of investigation at the 115th Precinct in Jackson Heights on Saturday. The inquiry began when four of the deaf immigrants showed up at the station house at midnight with a three-page letter in Spanish, only to leave nervously without giving it to the police. They went in and out of the station several times before turning over the letter at 4 A.M., then led the police at dawn to two apartments crammed with bunkbeds, mattresses and sleeping bags. The authorities have not released the letter's contents.Through interviews in New York and Mexico, a clearer picture emerged about the journey taken by these deaf immigrants, which apparently began with high hopes of starting a new life in this country and settled into a grim reality that the Mayor said was ''virtually slavery.''Although they were free to roam about New York while working, the immigrants believed they were captive to the bosses who had taken away their personal documents and kept most of their earnings. They were bound to them in a complicated relationship, the authorities said.''The biggest factor that kept them there was their disability, which kept them dependent on the smugglers, and isolated them terribly,'' Mr. Molerio said. ''That was their key vulnerability, and the smugglers exploited it tremendously.''Federal authorities say they believe that the Mexicans were recruited by the Paolettis to work in what they were told was a small business. They may have been recruited at a school for the deaf -- although many are illiterate -- or at what Queens District Attorney Richard Brown called ''homes for the impaired.'' Some may have been taken to the United States against their will.They arrived gradually, in small groups. Almost all were smuggled over the border by a professional coyote, or expert border crosser, hired by the ring, officials said. They were met on the other side by vans that took them to the Los Angeles area, where they were kept in houses controlled by the ring before taking commercial flights to Newark or La Guardia Airports, according to Federal investigators.The smugglers themselves appear to have traveled back and forth on tourist visas. In New York, the immigrants turned over their documents -- their birth certificates, Mexican identity cards and, for those few who had them, their fake tourist visas -- to the enforcers.The immigrants were stashed in one of two Jackson Heights apartments near the Number 7 subway line, where men, women, teen-agers, toddlers and infants slept in shifts, stacked atop one another in bunkbeds.They received a salary of $400 a month, from which $200 was withdrawn for rent, leaving $200 that was pooled to buy food and clothing.During a long day of questioning on Saturday, investigators scrambled to find interpreters of sign language and Spanish to help them communicate with the victims and the defendants. Since the police took the victims and the defendants into custody at the same time, it was hard at first to tell who was who.''For a while, our people didn't know who was saint and who was sinner,'' Mr. Brown said.The situation was not completely solved even by the arrival of sign language interpreters fluent in Spanish. Many of the deaf Mexicans were uneducated, even unsocialized, and spoke a kind of pidgin sign language that baffled the specialized interpreters.''It was excruciatingly difficult to deal with these people's disability,'' Mr. Molerio said. ''This thing to me was worth two Golden Ventures in difficulty.'' He was referring to the ship that ran aground off Queens filled with smuggled Chinese immigrants, and the complex saga of immigrant desperation that was the point of reference for New Yorkers yesterday.At the Westway Motor Inn, near La Guardia Airport, the Mexican immigrants were held in a curious limbo. They ate hamburgers and potato salad, watched television, lounged and slept, only to be interrupted at intervals by the police and medical workers -- who examined the children and found them healthy. In the morning, one frustrated officer requested and got a master room key from the front desk because no one could hear him knocking.''They asked what was on the television about them,'' said Robert Wingate, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in New York. ''Some of them asked about baseball scores. Having a hotel room of your own to relax in can't be a negative after what some of these people have been through.''From outside the motel, a sign language speaker waved to an immigrant peering out a window. She signed, ''Are you afraid?''''No,'' the man answered. ''I feel O.K. I feel good. But I have no money.''The interpreter continued, ''Will you go to Mexico or stay in America?''''I don't know,'' the man said. ''It's up to the police.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/16/us/judge-denies-formal-move-for-deaf-jury.html", "headline": "Judge Denies Formal Move For Deaf Jury", "date": "1996-10-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from October 16, 1996, Section A, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

So is his accuser. And so are most of the character witnesses.Therefore, argued Riverside County public defender Mara Feiger last week, if the jury members impaneled for the rape trial are to judge the sign-language testimony accurately, they should be deaf as well, or at least speak American Sign Language.Ms. Feiger's pre-trial request went down to defeat today when Judge Gordon R. Burkhart of Superior Court in Riverside ruled against it, agreeing with a county prosecutor that juries could not be tailored to fit such requirements.But Ms. Feiger and advocates for the deaf said the request served to highlight the particular disadvantages that deaf people like the defendant, 19-year-old Jesse Manual Macias, face in court, judged by people whose whole way of communicating is deeply different.''Sign language is really unlike any other language in that we're relying so very heavily on the interpreter to convey the whole message,'' Ms. Feiger said in a telephone interview this afternoon.When witnesses who speak other languages testify through interpreters, the jury can nonetheless hear their intonation and emotion shining through the foreign syllables. But American Sign Language, interpreters say, depends powerfully on body language and hand positions that cannot easily be captured in words and that jurors watching a witness testify will not often understand.''With sign language, a lot of inflection and expression is based on body language and it's very difficult to translate to spoken language,'' said Suzette Schuster, an interpreter for Lifesigns, a Riverside-based offshoot of the Greater Los Angeles Council on Deafness.She said that some two million Americans have mastered the gestures and different grammar of American Sign Language and its physical subtleties. A raised eyebrow or a shifted shoulder can pack such a semantic wallop, she said, that ''a lot really does get lost in translation -- it does get filtered.''Ms. Feiger, the public defender, said she decided to pursue the request for a special jury after hearing about preliminary testimony by the 18-year-old woman who is accusing Mr. Macias of raping her this June, back when both were seniors at the California School for the Deaf in Riverside.After the woman testified, Ms. Feiger said, deaf supporters of Mr. Macias said they doubted her account, telling the lawyer: ''It's obvious by the way she is signing.''''So,'' Ms. Feiger said, ''I grabbed the ball and ran with it.''Her argument centered on legal instructions for juries telling them they were to be the sole judges of whether a witness was believable, and that in deciding, they could take into account the demeanor and manner of a witness. Jurors are supposed to use their life experiences to determine if a witness is telling the truth, she said, but those who do not speak sign language would not have the experience or ability to judge.Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Brewer disagreed, though she noted that it was always a concern that nuances might get lost in courtroom interpretation.But, she said in a telephone interview, ''when you're guaranteed a jury of your peers, you're not guaranteed a jury of similarly situated people, be they all deaf or blind or black or Caucasian or Hispanic.''''It is a cross-section of your peers,'' Ms. Brewer said. ''It would have established a very bad public policy because then we'd have the next Spanish-speaking victim and defendant demanding they have an all-Spanish-speaking jury. It just becomes illogical.''Nuances of expression become especially important in the case of Mr. Macias because his defense rests on the credibility of the woman, whom he had known for several years, Ms. Feiger said. She said her client's defense was that whatever happened was consensual. The woman reported the incident to a school counselor, who informed the authorities.The woman had testified earlier that she had cried out for help during the incident but that the other students at the school, being deaf, had not heard her."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/20/movies/lincoln-center-plans-screenings-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Lincoln Center Plans Screenings for the Deaf", "date": "1996-08-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from August 20, 1996, Section C, Page 18Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Giuliani's plan to remove 16,300 fire alarm boxes, a Federal judge ruled yesterday that the plan violated the civil rights of the city's 65,000 deaf and hearing-impaired residents.Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court ordered the Fire Department to halt its plan to replace the antiquated alarm boxes with public telephones. He said that because deaf people are unable to use pay telephones to call for help, the plan violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, which guarantees equal access to public services.The removal of street alarm boxes would deprive the deaf and hearing-impaired of the ability to make such reports from the streets and to benefit from doing so,\" the judge wrote.Franklin Siegel, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, who, along with Robert B. Stulberg, represented the plaintiffs, called the decision \"an important finding on the responsibility of government to make sure that services do not omit people with disabilities.\"Lawyers for the city said yesterday they would not appeal Judge Sweet's ruling. They said they would instead try to persuade him that a new emergency phone system was usable by the deaf. With the system, which locates the origin of each 911 call, the deaf could alert dispatchers by tapping a code over the phone.Judge Sweet did not order the city to reconnect its 4,039 alarm boxes that have been temporarily disconnected in a pilot program to gauge the impact on several neighborhoods. He said the study should be concluded; a report on the results is expected to be released by the Fire Department within the next several weeks.The alarm boxes were first installed in 1870 to replace neighborhood sentinels perched on watchtowers throughout the city. There are two kinds of boxes now: one with a button that activates an intercom, and an older model that has a lever. Both automatically notify a dispatcher. When using the intercom alarm boxes, many deaf people know they can use a series of taps to report a fire to dispatchers.City lawyers said the new \"enhanced 911\" system, which began on Jan. 22, can be used in the same way. \"We will be reproducing essentially the same firebox system with the E-911 system,\" said Jonathan Pines, deputy chief of general litigation for the city.Stephen G. Younger 2d, the president of the Civic Association of the Deaf of New York City and a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit, said he was wary of the E-911 system.\"What if I picked up the phone and the phone was dead and I couldn't tell?\" Mr. Younger, who is deaf, said yesterday in an interview. \"That invalidates the whole thing. I would not be able to report an emergency that might save lives.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/16/business/for-the-hard-of-hearing-a-dose-of-digital-audio.html", "headline": "For the Hard of Hearing, A Dose of Digital Audio", "date": "1995-10-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 16, 1995, Section D, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Unlike most of today's aids, which give the wearer few options for adjusting the sound to compensate for a particular hearing problem, the coming generation of hearing aids will contain miniature but powerful computer chips to tailor sound to the ear of the person wearing the device.Most of the industry leaders are at work on digital hearing aids, and one of the first products to reach the market is expected early next year from Oticon Holding A.S., a privately held Danish manufacturer.\"Hearing loss is as individual as a fingerprint,\" said Lars Kolind, president of Oticon. \"It varies with frequency and decibel levels so the challenge was to develop a nonlinear way to amplify sound to match a person's need.\"All hearing aids consist of three major components: a microphone to receive sound, circuitry to amplify and modify it, and a speaker to deliver the sound into the ear. So far, the approximately 1.5 million hearing aids sold in the United States each year by companies that include Oticon, Starkey Laboratories and Siemens, employ analog technology in which sound is translated to electrical impulses in a pattern that replicates the sound wave.Digital audio, by contrast, translates sound to electric impulses that can be captured in precise computer code and manipulated just like any other software. Designers say that digital hearing aids will make it easier to filter out background noises and deliver more realistic sound.Hearing loss experts say it is too early to tell whether the new devices will have their desired effect for a wide range of users. But they say they would welcome any improvements in hearing aids, which are used regularly by some five million people in this country but might be beneficial to five times that many if they worked better.Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0Feb. 4, 2022, 1:43 p.m. ETHere\u2019s what you need to know about the January jobs report.Architects at a prominent New York firm drop their unionization bid.Hertz hires a former Goldman Sachs finance chief as its C.E.O.\"People expect that a hearing aid will restore normal hearing, which is not the case,\" said Donna Sorkin, executive director of Self Help for Hard of Hearing People, an association based in Bethesda, Md. \"Too often they are disappointed and put the hearing aid in a drawer.\"One of the most difficult situations for today's hearing aids to handle, Ms. Sorkin said, is conversation in a crowded situation, with lots of other voices and background noise. \"There are times when you have to use other strategies, such as where to position yourself in a room or use speech reading in addition to the hearing aid,\" she said.Although hearing aids, like magnifying eyeglasses, can be boughtthrough the mail, both manufacturers and user groups urge that they be bought only after a careful hearing test. Since most people with hearing loss have more difficulty with some sound frequencies than others, the tests allow audiologists to adjust the hearing aid for maximum effect.Digital capabilities would allow even finer gradations, the makers say. And like some of today's better analog models, the digital versions would give users the ability to select different sound settings, depending on whether the wearer is working in an office, conversing in a public place, watching television at home or in some other situation with different acoustic demands.The analog devices now sold in the United States typically range from $700 to $2,000, and 8 of every 10 are small enough to be inserted into the ear. Oticon, which has not yet set a price for its digital hearing aid, plans to bring out behind-the-ear and in-the-ear models simultaneously."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/11/nyregion/deaf-group-sues-over-alarm-boxes.html", "headline": "Deaf Group Sues Over Alarm Boxes", "date": "1995-10-11T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 11, 1995, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

There are two kinds of alarm boxes, one with a button that activates an intercom, and an even older model that has a simple lever. Both automatically notify a dispatcher where the emergency is, even if nothing is said to the dispatcher.Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani contends the boxes are expensive, inefficient and the source of many false reports. Yesterday, the Mayor's office declined to comment on the suit because city lawyers had yet to read the complaint."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/20/nyregion/judge-orders-state-to-provide-special-help-to-deaf-prisoners.html", "headline": "Judge Orders State to Provide Special Help to Deaf Prisoners", "date": "1995-06-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 20, 1995, Section B, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Sweet came in a class-action lawsuit filed four years ago by six deaf prisoners. The inmates contended that their inability to communicate had effectively isolated them from the world and had made it impossible for them to understand disciplinary, grievance and parole hearings, much less go to educational classes.In an 87-page opinion, Judge Sweet said lack of good interpreters in state penitentiaries had sentenced deaf inmates to \"a prison within a prison.\"Chris McKenna, a spokesman for the State Attorney General's Office, said the state had not decided whether to appeal. A spokesman for the State Department of Correctional Services, James Flateau, declined to comment on the decision, saying that state officials have not yet read it.There are at least 50 deaf inmates in the state prison system, lawyers said.The judge ruled that not only had the prisons violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, but they had also denied prisoners their right to fair hearings and ignored the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.Judge Sweet pointed out that some of the deaf inmates had been punished unfairly because they did not understand a guard's orders. One inmate, Terryton Harrison, was held in solitary confinement for 15 days at Attica in January 1994 after he failed to obey an order from a guard to pick up a cup in the mess hall, the judge said. Mr. Harrison had asked for an interpreter at his disciplinary hearing but none was provided.Janet E. Sabel, a Legal Aid lawyer, brought the suit on behalf of the prisoners in March 1991 after she discovered that one of her former clients, Doris Clarkson, a deaf woman who speaks little English, had been jailed in Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for almost three years without any way of communicating with officials.\"She was absolutely living in a communications vacuum,\" Ms. Sabel said.In the ruling, the judge ordered the state to come up with a plan for meeting the requirements of the disabilities act and inform deaf inmates about it. He also said the prisons must hire qualified sign-language interpreters to work in the prison's offices and to translate in educational classes, at hearings and during medical visits."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/28/obituaries/t-g-gradnauer-54-teacher-of-the-deaf.html", "headline": "T.

And, yes, his feet and hands were unusually big; his size 18 shoes were beginning to pinch. But that wasn't what brought him to the doctor, either. No, it was his gait. His knock-knees were getting ever more knocked, the upper legs twisting inward so that his knees were too close together, his ankles too far apart, his feet splayed, his abnormal walk a growing embarrassment to him. So he consulted an orthopedic surgeon.By the time his case had been reviewed in detail, his bones X-rayed, his blood sampled, his genes assayed and anatomized, he had overturned a long-standing medical paradigm, belied the endocrinology textbooks and defied scientific predictions merely by being alive.The young man, whose identity is being kept confidential by his doctors, has a genetic defect never seen before in a human, one that is supposed to be so devastating that he should not even be alive. The cells of his body lack a component needed to allow them to respond to estrogen, a hormone once thought to be critical to life. He makes plenty of estrogen in his adrenal glands, his testes and elsewhere, as men normally do, but he lacks the receptor necessary to allow his body tissues to respond to all the estrogen he generates.According to scientific presumption, a person without estrogen receptors should have died in the womb, or perhaps ended up with a grossly distorted central nervous system. Yet here he is, healthy in appearance and normal by most measurements, with a couple of outstanding exceptions. At age 28, 10 years after most males have reached their adult height, he is still growing. His epiphyses, the tips of the bones which are supposed to harden and fuse together at about 18 and thus spell an end to skeletal growth, remain soft and cartilaginous, as though he were a 15-year-old boy who is still upward -- and outward -- bound.\"He told me the other day that he just moved up to a size 19 shoe,\" said Dr. Eric P. Smith, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Dr. Smith and collaborators from several institutions describe the paradigm-smashing case in the current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.At the same time the young man's bones are elongating, they are also becoming progressively weaker and more porous. As it turns out, he suffers from osteoporosis of a degree that might be expected, said Dr. Smith, \"in an elderly, postmenopausal woman.\"The two symptoms together -- lack of epiphyseal closure and the degradation of the bone structure -- surprised all the researchers who took part in the study. The findings demonstrate that estrogen is as important to a man's bone strength and skeletal structure as it is to a woman's; in the past, doctors thought that male hormones, the androgens, controlled bone development in men.The symptoms also suggest that estrogen acts directly on bone cells, rather than through an indirect mechanism, as had been proposed. The young man's bone cells, like all his other cells, lack the estrogen receptor and so are unable to benefit from the strengthening influence of the hormone coursing through his bloodstream. Without the estrogen signal, his skeleton is gradually demineralizing, the calcium dissolving away like chalk in water. The means for preventing further decay remain unclear: estrogen replacement therapy cannot help a man whose cells are deaf to estrogen's call.Beyond its relevance to medical understanding of bone metabolism, the case of the man without estrogen receptors highlights science's profound ignorance about the role of the sex steroids, the estrogens and the androgens, in dictating human physical or psychological growth. Although estrogen is commonly thought of as a female hormone and testosterone -- the most famed of the androgens -- as a male hormone, in fact both sexes produce considerable amounts of the other's hormones. In addition to manufacturing estrogen, men also turn some of their circulating androgens into estrogens, which then act on the body's tissues in various ways.The man without estrogen receptors may lead to a radical reinterpretation of how the male and female hormones independently influence the body and brain. Not only does he challenge the notion that estrogen responsiveness is fundamental to life, he also appears to contradict a widely accepted idea that estrogen is an essential signal for shaping the masculine brain and forming its sexual identity. According to this notion, which is supported by a considerable amount of data from animal studies, testosterone's effects on the male brain are actually carried out in large part through estrogen: When the androgen reaches the brain, most of it is transformed into estrogen by an enzyme called aromatase, and it then speaks to the brain cells via their estrogen receptors.Testosterone also interacts directly with some parts of the brain, linking up with receptors designed to recognize the male hormone. But the two classes of hormones were thought jointly important in organizing the male brain during its development and in creating some of the behavior seen in most men, including a general propensity to like women as sexual partners, a robust libido, perhaps even a tendency toward aggressive, competitive behavior.Even without estrogen, however, the man's brain appears to be perfectly normal. Moreover, says Dr. Smith, he seems to be your average heterosexual guy, who expresses avid interest in women and has nocturnal emissions and morning erections and the like. Certainly his male hormones have in every other way turned him into a man. He reached puberty at the normal age, around 12, he has a full beard, normal genitals, a deep voice and masculine muscle development.Dr. Daniel D. Federman of Harvard Medical School, who wrote a commentary accompanying The New England Journal of Medicine report, said in an interview that he hoped others like the young man will be identified. By studying such cases, he said, science may begin to parse out the various effects of male and female hormones on the brain and behavior. \"We look at the different ways in which men and women play sports and just generally compete in life, and we also notice that men are disproportionately involved in violence,\" he said. \"We assume some of this is testosterone-induced, but if the brain can make estrogen out of testosterone, we always have to wonder which of the two hormones is really having an effect.\"If we had, say, 100 people with this sort of genetic mutation, people who had no estrogen receptors, we could begin to cleave the impact of one hormone away from the other,\" he added. In other words, people like the young man in the report could offer a reasonably clean portrait of how testosterone alone influences brain architecture and any number of behaviors. There is some indication from mouse studies that male animals without estrogen receptors are less aggressive than are normal male mice, but the results are highly preliminary, and in any case the relevance of mouse data to human behavior is questionable at best. Rodent brains develop in a very different manner than do those of humans and other primates.It may not be difficult to identify other men with this mutation, the researchers said, now that the symptoms have been described. If doctors see men who are much taller than their parents and who do not have excess growth hormone production (a sign of a well-known disorder called acromegaly), such men might prove to have unresponsive estrogen receptors. One of the researchers on the report suggested that the National Basketball Association may be reasonable place to start searching.However, the mutation is likely to be rare in the general population, and for it to have an effect it must be inherited in a double dose. The young man in the report, for example, is the son of parents who are third cousins, each a silent carrier of the mutation.Dr. Frederick Naftolin, a neuroendocrinologist and chairman of obstetrics-gynecology at Yale School of Medicine, said that while he found the new report \"extremely interesting,\" he cautioned that much remains to be resolved about this patient. He proposed that, even without working estrogen receptors, the man may still be responding to his inherent estrogen signals in subtle ways.Some scientists lately have argued that estrogen can exert its potent and multifarious effects through means other than by coupling with the designated estrogen receptor, perhaps by hooking onto cell receptors meant for other hormones in the body or by changing the properties of the delicate cell membranes. Scientists have also argued that estrogenlike compounds in the environment end up having a broad range of ill effects on human health and fertility through just such unexpected and indirect mechanisms. Here, too, the man could prove a useful guinea pig, should he be willing; scientists could study him for evidence that estrogen can indeed bypass the traditional receptors and still get across some sort of stimulatory message.Whatever the outcome of the discovery, the new work stems from a striking convergence of basic and clinical observations. The young man came to Dr. Smith's attention after it was discovered that his epiphyses were unfused and that his circulating estrogen level was high. He also had an elevated insulin concentration, suggesting a minor defect in sugar metabolism. It was an excellent medical mystery for a pediatric endocrinologist, who looks at hormone imbalances in children; despite the man's age, he seemed to have a child's bones. The elevated estrogen led Dr. Smith to suspect he was unresponsive to the hormone, and thus it lingered in the bloodstream uselessly. To test the possibility, he put the young man on a regimen for six months that raised his estrogen level tenfold. In most men, such a manipulation would have led to obvious problems like breast growth, headaches, weight gain and mood alterations. In this man, nothing happened.Dr. Smith then heard about new results from experimental mice. Dr. Kenneth S. Korach of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, N.C., and his co-workers had bred genetically altered mice that lacked estrogen receptors. The fact that such mice survived astonished Dr. Smith as well as others in the scientific community, and he began to wonder whether his patient might be a human version of these receptor-free rodents. The researchers decided to collaborate.On analyzing the young man's DNA, Dr. Korach discovered that, sure enough, both his copies of the gene that allows the body to create estrogen receptors were so defective that no receptors at all could roll off their chemical templates. He defied the dogma that such receptors were needed, and even grew to a supermasculine height. His growth is now slowing and is expected to stop fairly soon (although the osteoporosis may continue to worsen), and he might never have made medical history had his bones not proved incapable of supporting the house they had built."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/24/us/on-campus-study-of-sign-language-booming-at-rochester.html", "headline": "On Campus; Study of Sign Language Booming at Rochester", "date": "1994-08-24T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 24, 1994, Section B, Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The number of sign-language courses has more than doubled over the past two years.Two years of studying sign language satisfies the university's foreign-language requirement, but students and teachers say the interest stems from other factors: a desire to communicate with the large deaf community in Rochester, home to the National Institute of Technology for the Deaf; careers in health or social services, or simply a new challenge.Only a handful of colleges and universities around the country offer extensive sign-language programs. Rochester began its program in 1988 with one part-time instructor. There are now four instructors, a translator and two administrators.Except for the very first day, all classes are taught entirely in sign language. Second-year classes teach students how to conduct more complex conversations, and there are upper-level courses in the history and culture of sign language, sociolinguistics and literature. This fall, a deaf graduate student from Japan will teach Japanese Sign Language.The university also now has a sign language club.\"I know Spanish and French have practical uses,\" said one of the club's founders, Jill C. Bernstein, a junior majoring in an interdisciplinary program called health and society. \"But you don't see people around campus speaking Spanish or French. I see people sitting at tables in the student union signing all the time.\" UMass Freezes Tuition and FeesThe University of Massachusetts at Amherst has frozen tuition and mandatory fees for the first time in 29 years after an intense lobbying effort by students, parents and school officials succeeded in getting the State Legislature to allocate more money for higher education.Students at the university, one of the most expensive state universities in the country, had been protesting the continually rising costs -- by more than 25 percent in some years -- and one day in February they occupied the admissions building for nearly 20 hours to demand a tuition freeze.The administration responded by agreeing to keep tuition and fees at $5,467 a year, the same as 1993-94, if the Legislature would increase state aid by at least the amount of the rise in the cost of living.The students then took on the Legislature.\"We called all the parents of all the students who live in districts represented by members of the House Ways and Means Committee,\" said Mirran Raphaely, a 20-year-old junior from Worcester, Mass., who is president of the university's Student Government Association. \"We got 4,000 parents to say they would call.\"It worked. A $6.3 million increase in state appropriations was needed to freeze tuition at the university's Amherst campus. The five-campus system got an increase of $15 million. Truth in Grades, Dartmouth StyleWhile Stanford University has taken on grade inflation by bringing back the failing grade and giving more C's and D's, Dartmouth College is trying another approach: more information on report cards.Beginning this fall with the class of '98, the college will include class size and median grades on students' transcripts. Grade inflation on the Hanover, N.H., campus has been gradual, to 3.23 in 1992-93 from 3.06 in 1976-77, on a 4.0 scale.\"Grades, without putting them into some sort of context, mean little,\" said Gary Johnson, a chemistry professor and the chairman of a faculty committee that proposed the change.But some professors said the new system, based on one used at McGill University in Montreal, would increase competition among students. It will \"pit one student against another,\" Delo Mook, a physics professor, told The Dartmouth, the daily student newspaper. \"I don't think that's something we want to encourage.\"One student leader said it was a worthy idea, but the wrong approach. \"I think bringing institutions like Dartmouth back to a point where you are actually earning a grade, not getting a grade, but really working and learning and earning a grade is important,\" said the summer student-body president, Grace Chionuma, a 19-year-old junior. \"But I think that struggle begins with the faculty, it doesn't begin with the student transcripts. This seems a very roundabout way of getting to a central issue.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/22/nyregion/chief-executive-to-step-down-at-deaf-center.html", "headline": "Chief Executive To Step Down At Deaf Center", "date": "1994-06-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 22, 1994, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Max Gould, a banking executive who was named to the post in April, said recently that he was withdrawing because his presence had become divisive. His decision allows the center to search for a new candidate, and officials at the center, based in Jackson Heights, Queens, said many of those who have led the protests would be allowed to join the search process.Mr. Gould's decision was hailed by the protesters, who had staged walkouts from the Lexington School for the Deaf and demonstrations around the city after claiming to have been excluded from Mr. Gould's selection. 'A Tremendous Impact'\"This change will have a tremendous impact on not only the Lexington community but on the entire deaf community in New York City,\" said Jackie Roth, an alumna of the school who helped lead the protest.The effort and the outcome were similar to a successful protest in 1988 at Gallaudet University in Washington. Gallaudet, the liberal arts college for the deaf, agreed to replace its president, who can hear, with a deaf educator after a week of unrest that closed the school and instigated a national movement for deaf rights.The upheaval at Lexington also led to a decision by Edward H. Cohen, its president and a supporter of Mr. Gould, not to stay on when it became clear that the board of trustees was deeply divided over Mr. Gould's selection, said Esther Lustig, the center's director of external affairs. Last week the board chose Philip W. Bravin, president of the National Captioning Institute, as the first deaf president in the center's 130-year history.Mr. Bravin said in an interview yesterday that he believed the protesters were justified in their anger at not having a greater role in the selection of Mr. Gould. \"Being deaf is a characteristic, not a qualification, but I can understand why they feel that way,\" said Mr. Bravin, who played a similar role at Gallaudet when elected the university's chairman after the protests there.Mr. Gould, who would have become chief executive on July 1, declined to discuss his decision in an interview. In his withdrawal letter, he said his appointment was clouding the real issues about Lexington's future."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/27/nyregion/deaf-students-protest-new-school-head.html", "headline": "Deaf Students Protest New School Head", "date": "1994-04-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 27, 1994, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The students protesting outside the Lexington School for the Deaf were chanting in American Sign Language, and they had no trouble communicating with one another.\"We want a deaf C.E.O. now!\" signed a group of six students, standing on top of a low wall and drawing cheers from the 100 other students and faculty members outside the school, on 75th Street in Jackson Heights, Queens, a few blocks from La Guardia Airport.\"Who is Max? I don't know!\" the students continued. \"Who is Max? I don't know!\" After a Long SearchThe students were referring to R. Max Gould, a banking executive who earlier this month was named the executive vice president and chief executive officer of the Lexington Center, the parent body of the largest school for deaf children in New York State.Mr. Gould's appointment, after a long search, angered many students and faculty members, who think that the center's deaf clientele should have played a larger role in selecting its leader. Most of the 154 students at Lexington's high school are refusing to attend classes until Mr. Gould resigns, although the 250 students in lower grades were in class yesterday.The protests are straining the tightly knit center, which also includes a research division, mental health clinic and hearing and speech center. Founded in 1864, it serves 14,000 people a year through government grants, private donations and fees.Administrators aren't sure what to make of the student's five demands, including Mr. Gould's resignation and a pledge that there will be no reprisals against demonstrators.\"Reprisals?\" asked Esther Lustig, the center's director of external affairs and development, looking at the students milling outside her window. \"We're a lot more concerned about making sure they get some lunch than taking reprisals.\" Protest at GallaudetThe students, now in their second day of demonstrations, are serious in their demands, inspired by the success of a similar protest at Gallaudet University in 1988. Gallaudet, the liberal arts college for the deaf, based in Washington, agreed to replace its hearing president with a deaf educator after a week of unrest that closed the school and instigated a national movement for deaf rights.\"It's like a black college was looking for a C.E.O., and they interviewed six whites and two blacks, and hired a white,\" said Nicholas LaLanne, one of the leaders of the demonstration and a former student body president. \"It's the same parallel, people wanting to make their own decisions.\" Mr. LaLanne, like most of those interviewed outside, spoke through a sign language interpreter.\"We don't have to depend on hearing people,\" said Jeff Bravin, who teaches social studies at the school. \"We can do it ourselves.\"Mr. Gould, a senior vice president at Citicorp and the chief operating officer of Quotron, the stock quote company, said he has no intention of withdrawing. As the father of twin sons who are deaf, he says his long record of involvement on the board of the Lexington Center and with other organizations for the deaf, combined with his managerial experience, qualifies him for the job.\"All along, the board said it wanted the most qualified person for the job,\" he said. \"If they could find one who was deaf, fine. But my qualifications for the job exceeded those for any available deaf person.\"Last summer, after advertising to fill the position, the board had offered the job to a deaf person, but he turned it down for personal reasons, Ms. Lustig said. The board then hired a search firm that recommended four candidates, one of whom was deaf. In March, Mr. Gould, an associate chairman of the board, asked that his name be added to the list. The six-member search committee, two of whom are deaf, voted for Mr. Gould earlier this month, and the decision was accepted by a slim majority of the board last week. Ms. Lustig said 7 or 8 of the board's 45 members are deaf.The protesters are demanding that 51 percent of the board be made up of deaf people. Though not necessarily agreeing with any demands, the center's administrators, including Mr. Gould, said they hoped to meet with the students soon to establish grounds for discussions.The protesters said many hearing administrators at the school took a paternalistic attitude, assuming that the students needed to be helped with their \"disorder.\" Several said it was time that deaf children had a role model at the highest levels of the center.\"None of the major agencies for the deaf in New York have a deaf person at the helm,\" said Jackie Roth, an alumnus who was helping organize the protest. \"Lexington is one of our oldest institutions, and it should set an example so that deaf people could have someone to look up to.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/03/us/language-of-the-deaf-evolves-to-reflect-new-sensibilities.html", "headline": "Language of the Deaf Evolves To Reflect New Sensibilities", "date": "1994-01-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 3, 1994, Section A, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

But now that we are becoming aware of cultural differences, people have feelings about it.\" Visually ProvocativeThe signs that are changing, like the spoken words that are dropping out of polite usage, are often those for ethnic groups. \"In American Sign Language, politically incorrect terms are often a visual representation of the ugly metaphors we have about people,\" said Prof. Elissa Newport, a psychologist at the University of Rochester who studies how signed languages are learned.The signs for \"Chinese\" and \"Korean,\" which are made by forming the letters \"C\" and \"K\" around the eye, are changing. There is a new sign for \"African-American\"; by contrast, \"Negro\" was indicated by flattening the nose.\" The old sign for \"homosexual\" was a swish of the wrist. One sign replacing it is to sign \"q\" for \"queer,\" a term once rejected by homosexuals but now in vogue among some.And a sign for \"stingy,\" derived from the sign for \"Jewish\" (stroking an imaginary beard), has started discussions among deaf Jews around the country, though no new sign has actually shown up in its stead. The sign adds a clenched or tight fist to the imaginary beard.\"Political correctness has definitely crept into the deaf world,\" said Prof. Yerker Andersson, a sociologist here at Gallaudet University, the world's only liberal arts college for the deaf. \"Though I don't always care to use that label, because some people use it negatively. When I say 'political correctness,' I mean 'increased sensitivity.' \"For many deaf people, the new signs are not only indications of sensitivity to those who feel slighted by stereotypes, but the signs also reflect deaf people's desire for recognition as a distinct group that deserves the same sort of deference being extended to ethnic, religious and racial minorities.But replacing what have become regarded as insults with acceptable signs that also work visually is not simple. After the old sign for \"Negro\" came to be seen as pejorative, it was replaced by either of the signs for the color \"black.\" In one, the index finger is placed by the eyebrow; in the other, it is wiped across the forehead.Today, some deaf people, like hearing people, prefer the sign for \"African-American.\" But the sign for \"African\" is changing, too, in part because it is still centered around the nose. The new sign is simply to outline the continent of Africa in the air with one's hand.As the old sign for homosexual was dropped because of its suggestion that homosexuals were effeminate, an alternative sign was to run a middle finger through the hair, though most homosexuals also regarded that sign as an epithet because of its overtly feminine character.The appropriate way to sign \"homosexual\" these days is to finger-spell it, or to place the sign for the letter \"q\" on the chin.Sign language changes gradually, just as English does. The fine-tuned, sensitized signs have caught on mostly in urban settings and among the highly educated, much in the same way that words like \"African-American\" caught on first at college campuses. The changes have not yet been registered in the most widely available dictionaries of sign language.Most sociologists believe that this attention to diversity has taken longer to catch on in the deaf community. \"Deaf people have less access to the media,\" Professor Andersson said. \"Hearing people, obviously, hear everything, everything, so they become more aware of small cultural changes. It takes deaf people a bit more time to realize them.\"Some educators and sociologists also believe that these efforts to modify American Sign Language are of marginal value.\"Political correctness in the deaf community is certainly meaningful to a degree, because it addresses the stereotypes of certain groups,\" said Frederic Jondreau, the director of the American Sign Language Institute in Manhattan. \"But I think its overall impact is questionable. The deaf don't really have the luxury of fully dealing with issues like race and gender yet. They're still addressing issues in deafness, like the acceptance of sign language.\"Some of the recent revisions in American Sign Language reflect this respect for linguistic sovereignty. Over the last 10 years, the deaf community has adopted dozens of signs that deaf people in other nations use for themselves, even though some of their earlier versions were not considered offensive.Professor Andersson, who is also the President of the World Federation for the Deaf, says that deaf Americans are also adopting these signs because they have had more contact with their peers abroad in the last few years.But he and other educators agree that this borrowing frenzy would never have happened if the culture at large had not become so attuned to issues of ethnic diversity.\"If there was no American sensitivity to political correctness, no one in the deaf community would be paying much attention to this,\" Mr. Jondreau said.At times, the use of these foreign signs can get a bit complicated.For example, putting one hand face down in front of the body and plucking something off it with the other, as if pulling a tissue out of a box, is the new American sign for Swedish. This sign, derived from mountains, is the one that deaf Swedes use for themselves. But in some dialects of American Sign Language it means \"bald,\" and many Swedes would not consider that a compliment.\"When I first saw the sign, I thought, 'What do I do here about political correctness?' \" said Ted Supalla, a professor of linguistics at the University of Rochester who specializes in signed languages. \"But then I thought, 'Well it's their sign, I really should use it.' \"But this trend can also erase damaging stereotypes about the United States. The deaf in this country have recently begun to encourage their counterparts abroad to change their stereotyped signs for \"American\" to the sign that deaf Americans use for themselves. That sign is to lightly weave the fingers of both hands together in front of the body and bring them around in a circle, as if stirring a pot.In Russia, this change certainly casts the United States in a more flattering light. There, the previous sign for \"American\" was to suggest a big belly with one hand and simultaneously mouth the word \"capitalism.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/14/obituaries/john-e-bordley-90-professor-and-expert-on-treating-the-deaf.html", "headline": "John E.

Through much of the film, she is menaced by Lieutenant Brock (Martin Sheen), the sadistic police officer who engineered the heist and wants his treasure back. Brock happens to be an opera nut who when interrogating witnesses turns up the volume on \"Cavalleria Rusticana\" to drown out their screams. Jillian's ally and soon-to-be-lover Ben (D. B. Sweeney) is that epitome of sensitive male perfection, a rock-climbing chef.\"Hear No Evil,\" which opened locally on Friday, aspires to be a kind of yuppie \"Wait Until Dark\" for the deaf. Its strongest asset is its star, who exudes some of the same defiant sensuality that animated her Oscar-winning performance in \"Children of a Lesser God.\" Periodically, the film suspends its conventional soundtrack to try to imagine what it's like to be deaf and in mortal peril. But its gestures in that direction are only token.Although the film has serviceable performances, they cannot cover up the story's gaping holes or redeem the thudding predictability of R. M. Badat's screenplay. No sooner have Ben and Jillian got into bed than he asks her to teach him erotic sign language. The mechanical dialogue is interrupted by chase sequences that have some visceral energy despite being too drawn out.\"Hear No Evil\" is set in Portland, Ore., and its environs. With its gobs of pretty scenery, it is, if nothing else, an effective travel brochure for the Pacific Northwest. \"Hear No Evil\" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Or, in the context of a parochial school, does the interpreter inevitably convey a religious message and thus play an impermissible role for someone paid with public funds, as the lawyer for an Arizona school district argued?While the Justices appeared to find the question intriguing, they gave no sign of how they would answer it. The case is a potential vehicle for a re-examination of the Court's major church-state precedents, but little was said in the courtroom today, from either the lawyers or the Justices, to suggest that such a re-examination was likely.William Bentley Ball, arguing for a couple who paid for a sign-language interpreter for their deaf son at a Catholic high school after the public school district refused to cover the cost, said two lower courts had concluded incorrectly that the Court's existing precedents made the service impermissible. Lower Courts See ViolationThe Federal District Court in Arizona and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, concluded that it would violate the First Amendment's prohibition against the \"establishment\" of religion for the government to pay for an interpreter at a religious school.The courts said the interpreter's presence would create a \"symbolic union\" between church and state.Under a 1970 Federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, handicapped students are entitled to a free, appropriate education. The school district, Catalina Foothills, near Tucson, had provided a sign-language interpreter for the student, James Zobrest, when he attended a public junior high school, and would have provided one at a nonsectarian private school.When he enrolled in a Roman Catholic high school, from which he graduated last year, the school district continued to provide him with speech therapy. But it said it could not provide an interpreter without running afoul of the Establishment Clause because the school's religious environment meant that the interpreter would be part of the \"delivery of the religious message,\" said John C. Richardson, a lawyer for the school district, appearing before the Justices today. \"The parents want a public employee standing in the classroom and informing James Zobrest that there is life after death\" and that Jesus Christ is the son of God, Mr. Richardson said. 'Simply a Translator'Mr. Ball, arguing for the student's family in the case, Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, No. 92-94, said there was no doubt that Salpointe Catholic High School \"is pervasively religious.\" But he said the lower courts were wrong to find that the presence of a government-paid interpreter would have the \"primary effect of advancing religion,\" which is impermissible under the Supreme Court's precedents.He said that the school itself would receive no financial benefit from the interpreter and that the interpreter would make no effort to \"inculcate religion.\" The interpreter \"is simply a translator, and that's it,\" Mr. Ball said.The Solicitor General's office argued today in support of the family, but it did not press the Court to overrule its church-state precedents as that office did throughout the Reagan and Bush Administrations. Laughter and PerplexityWilliam C. Bryson, a career Justice Department lawyer who is the Acting Solicitor General, told the Justices that the sign-language interpreter \"is this child's ears\" and that the Court's precedents supported providing services of this sort. He cited a 1986 Supreme Court opinion, Witters v. Washington, that upheld a blind student's use of state money to study for the ministry as part of a general state program that paid for some educational expenses of handicapped students.Mr. Bryson said that a providing an interpreter would not convey \"any implicit support on the part of the state for anything being said in providing the child with the means to hear what is said.\" He gave the analogy of a state-paid nurse who wheeled a paralyzed child from class to class, making it possible for the child to attend a religious school but providing no endorsement of the religious message.Justice David H. Souter questioned whether the example was appropriate. Unlike the nurse's physical labor, he said, the interpreter's function \"is inextricably bound up with communication of the message itself.\"There were several light moments during the arguments as various Justices acknowledged how complex and internally contradictory the Court's church-state precedents had become, particularly in the area of state aid for religious education.Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist intervened in one particularly intricate colloquy over whether the government could provide a hearing aid for a child to use at home as opposed to one for use in school. \"If this case turns on such finespun distinctions,\" he said, \"maybe it's time we tried to straighten out some of that.\"Justice Byron R. White, sitting to the Chief Justice's immediate right, said in a stage whisper: \"Be careful!\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/22/us/a-test-of-church-state-relations-in-a-deaf-student-s-need.html", "headline": "A Test of Church-State Relations in a Deaf Student's Need", "date": "1993-02-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 22, 1993, Section A, Page 10Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

They asked the Catalina Foothills School District here whether the state could continue to pay for a sign-language interpreter.Now, five years later, with Jim in college, that question is before the Supreme Court, in a case that could set a new standard for deciding how much separation between church and state the Constitution requires.Both the Arizona Attorney General and the lower courts that have heard the case say it would be an unconstitutional entanglement of church and state to give Jim Zobrest a a state-paid interpreter in a Catholic school, where religion is a pervasive part of the curriculum.Under the 1970 Federal Education of the Handicapped Act, deaf children have a right to a free and appropriate education, either in their public school or, if they go to private school, through reimbursement to their parents for the special services they need. But the state said that sending a state-paid interpreter into a religious school would create a symbolic union of church and state, violating the First Amendment. Backed by the ChurchThe Zobrests, backed by the Catholic Church, see it differently. They argue that an interpreter is a form of aid to their son, not to the church. Furthermore, they say, the state's decision to cut off the help it provided in public school in effect interfered with their right to exercise their religion, also guaranteed by the First Amendment.\"If Jim got a hearing aid from the State of Arizona, they wouldn't tell him he had to take it off in church,\" said Mrs. Zobrest, sitting on a couch and signing her words to Jim as she discussed the case. \"An interpreter is just a living, breathing hearing aid.\"Jim Zobrest, a lanky 18-year-old basketball player who is now a freshman at Pima Community College here, did go to, and graduate from, Salpointe Catholic High School -- but only because his parents paid $8,500 a year to hire their own interpreter.As it happened, it was the public schools that drew the Zobrests to Arizona. There were no schools for the deaf in Erie, Pa., where the family lived when Jim was born. So when he was old enough to enter school, the family moved to Tucson so he could attend the Arizona State School for the Deaf and Blind. He stayed at that school until sixth grade, by which time he had learned enough to attend a mainstream public school, with the aid of a sign-language interpreter. Getting a FoundationBut when the time came to think about high school, Mrs. Zobrest, a former teacher who is herself a product of Catholic schools, thought it was important that her son get a grounding in religious education.\"I wanted to give him a religious foundation,\" she said, \"and I used to try to take him to teaching Mass, where I tried signing what they were saying, but I spent most of my time answering questions like, 'How long before we can go home?' and 'Why do we have to come here?'\"I thought the only way he would learn the basics of Christianity was to be at a place like Salpointe, where it's part of the atmosphere.\"But the state, and the courts, say it was precisely because religion is so pervasive a part of the curriculum at Salpointe that it was unconstitutional for the state to supply an interpreter.The current standard for deciding what kind of aid to parochial schools is acceptable was set forth by the Supreme Court in a 1971 case, Lemon v. Kurtzman. That case established a three-part test, saying that a policy does not violate the Constitution if it has a secular purpose, does not as a primary effect advance religion and does not lead to \"entanglement\" of government and religion.But five of the sitting Justices have indicated discomfort with that test, which has resulted in nearly automatic invalidation of policies that provide only incidental benefits to religious institutions. And for several years, the three-prong test has widely been seen as ripe for being modified or overruled.Legally, the Zobrest cases lies in murky territory between two seemingly contradictory Supreme Court rulings from the 1980's. In Grand Rapids School District v. Ball, the Court barred publicly financed classes on the premises of religious schools. But in the other case, Witters v. Washington, it said state assistance to a blind student studying for the ministry was constitutionally permissible, as part of general aid to handicapped students.The issue of Federal aid to parochial schools has become particularly sensitive when many educators are examining the possibility of vouchers that would allow parents to take the money allotted for their child's public school education and apply it to the school of their choice -- possibly including religious school, if that were constitutionally permissible.So the Zobrest case has attracted attention from dozens of interest groups. The Zobrests are is backed not only by the Catholic Conference but also by the Justice Department, an array of disability rights' groups, and several religious groups, including the American Jewish Congress and the Baptist Joint Committee on Legal Affairs.Most of their friend-of-the-court briefs argue that it is excessively harsh to deny the Zobrests a sign-language interpreter simply to insure that no religious speech will be signed.\"The only message -- symbolic or real -- that the Zobrest family could have understood in this case was one of Government hostility to religion,\" said the brief of the Catholic Conference.But the groups on the other side -- among them, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National School Boards Association, the American Jewish Committee, and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith -- argue that it would be a breach of the most fundamental principles underlying the Constitution to allow the state to pay for an interpreter who would help in teaching and propagating religious beliefs.If a sign-language interpreter is no different from a hearing aid, the A.C.L.U. brief asks, would it be acceptable for the Government to provide an interpreter for church services?The National School Boards Association argues: \"Regardless of which analytical road one follows, the journey in this case will reach the same end -- a school district cannot pay a public employee to serve as a deaf interpreter during religious worship and religious instruction without unconstitutionally establishing religion.\" Four Years Late?The Zobrest case is to be argued before the High Court on Wednesday -- four years too late, the family says.\"We had no idea, when we decided to go ahead and pay for an interpreter ourselves that first year, that this could drag on so long,\" Mrs. Zobrest said. \"We kept thinking we'd get an answer soon, first from the school board, then from the district court, then from the court of appeals, which took a year and half to decide before turning us down. But the longer it went, the more determined we got.\"The Zobrests' lawyer, William Bentley Ball of Harrisburg, Pa., who is handling the case without charge, is the father of a woman Mrs. Zobrest met in a sign-language class in Pennsylvania when Jim was a baby.\"My daughter called me, and I thought originally it would be a matter of just writing a letter and explaining the law,\" said Mr. Ball, who has handled several other important constitutional cases dealing with religion. \"I certainly didn't think this would get to the Supreme Court.\"Mr. and Mrs. Zobrest, who both work at a Tucson collection agency, paid for the first year of interpreters. But when their case dragged on, they began asking for help.\"We found some very generous people and some foundations who helped us,\" Mrs. Zobrest said. \"If and when we win this case, we will pay them all back.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/28/style/currents-a-new-place-with-items-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "A New Place With Items for the Deaf", "date": "1993-01-28T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 28, 1993, Section C, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

And until they arrived in Washington last year for the English Language Institute at Gallaudet University, their link to the hearing world was oral and aural -- lip reading and voicing sounds.Many experts on educating the deaf now believe that making deaf children learn to lip-read and speak, instead of teaching them sign language at an early age, denies them the chance to communicate freely, at least with people who know how to sign, and therefore restricts their ability to learn language concepts.But this view is not held everywhere. In some countries, using sign language marks a deaf person as being poor or from the lower classes. In these and many other countries, the preferred method of teaching the deaf is to integrate them into the hearing world by emphasizing lip reading and speaking.\"My family didn't fully accept that I was deaf,\" said Mr. Pomeranec, who is 22 years old. \"Though I knew the oral and aural method, it was very frustrating and confusing. I wasn't getting enough information.\"In 1991, Mr. Pomeranec's upper-middle class family decided to send him and his twin brother to the English Language Institute at Gallaudet, the only university in the world primarily for deaf and hard-of-hearing students.The purpose of the program, which this year has 26 students, is to teach foreign students English as a second language, American Sign Language and cultural studies, to prepare them for undergraduate or gradute programs in the United States or to enhance their employment potential.But the toughest lesson for many of the students and their families is learning to accept deafness.\"There is a very prolonged negation of their child's deafness in some of these parents' lives and, of course, that is carried over in the student's life,\" said Francisco Martinez, the director of the 6-year-old program.Getting both students and their families to accept the deafness can be a challenge that, until overcome, impedes all other learning, according to Holly Roth, the coordinator for new students and a teacher of American Sign Language, or A.S.L.For a hearing person, listening to a deaf conversation is like watching a tennis match: the head does a lot of swiveling. And though many people who can hear assume that those flying fingers are a universal language -- a kind of soundless Esperanto, equally accessible to a deaf person from France or Japan -- that is not the case.Until a foreign student learns A.S.L. at Gallaudet, he or she is handicapped in learning English, said Ms. Roth.\"A lot of people still equate speech with intelligence\" and want to learn to speak rather than to sign, said Ms. Roth, who is deaf.Once students learn to sign, they are often less inhibited than the hearing at learning other languages in sign, Gallaudet teachers said.For Fadi Misbah Abu-Shaaban, a 19-year-old from Jordan, learning sign language opened up worlds of languages. \"I could speak and I could read, but it didn't open up my mind like sign did,\" he said. \"Now that I can go to lectures in sign, it's all out there, all in my brain. I don't have to translate.\"Having known few deaf people and almost no successful deaf professionals, some students arrive at the school intending to try it out for \"just a couple of weeks.\"Shovon Jamaly is at 24 the national tennis champion of Bangladesh. He arrived at Gallaudet the same year as the Pomeranec twins. He wanted to learn enough English and American Sign Language to join the professional circuit in the United States.He had been away from school for many years, but once in the program, Mr. Jamaly decided he could be as successful in academics as he was in tennis. Instead of embarking on the tennis tour, he returned for a second year at the Institute, to study business administration."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/04/news/a-school-for-the-deaf-that-s-founded-on-speech.html", "headline": "A School for the Deaf That's Founded on Speech", "date": "1992-03-04T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 4, 1992, Section B, Page 6Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Their first child, a boy then 9 months old, had been born deaf.But for Mrs. Kobylarz, the shock did not fully set in until months later, when the couple began searching for the right school for their son, Ryan. While visiting a school 30 minutes from her home that purported to teach both sign language and speech, she noticed that the classrooms seemed abnormally quiet.\"That really kind of floored me,\" Mrs. Kobylarz said. \"Even in the upper schools there wasn't talking going on, and I realized I really wanted Ryan to have the choice to speak.\" No Sign LanguageSo the Kobylarzs left their New Jersey roots and moved to a small town in western Massachusetts so that their son could enroll in the Clarke School for the Deaf, a small private institution across the street from Smith College in Northampton. Clarke is one of three schools in the country that teaches deaf children to read and speak using only hearing aids and lip-reading. No sign language is taught; students concentrate fully on learning speech.For deaf children, learning to speak is almost a Herculean task, much harder than learning to sign, their parents acknowledge. But parents at Clarke School say they chose that more difficult path believing that it would ultimately be easier for their children to live independently as adults. And they are doing so despite a movement to recognize American Sign Language as the primary method of deaf education.At Clarke, teachers wear amplifiers that broadcast their voices over a radio frequency to children wearing hearing aids. Those who are completely deaf learn to lip read and interpret other vibrations. Tuition is steep: $15,000 annually for day students and $27,000 for boarders, although scholarships are available.Founded 125 years ago by Gardiner Greene Hubbard, father-in-law to Alexander Graham Bell, Clarke has traditional been a boarding school. But for the last two years, day students have outnumbered boarders among the 110 students enrolled as more families with deaf children have moved to Northampton. Frustrated in Public School\"It was a lot of work and we're starting over again, but it was worth it,\" said Leslie Meli, who spent 11 months apart from her husband, a cable television executive who stayed behind in Locust Valley, L.I., until landing a job in Boston recently. The Melis have two deaf children enrolled in Clarke. A third, who has a less serious hearing impairment, attends public school in Northampton.The Melis moved when it became clear that their oldest child, John, now 9 years old, had become frustrated after two years in a public school special education program for the hearing-impaired on Long Island. \"He didn't have the words to ask questions,\" Mrs. Meli said. \"He couldn't describe things. He had to draw them.\" Now he can speak to his grandparents, who do not know sign language, she said.Cindy Higginbotham felt so strongly about teaching her daughter to speak that she moved to Northampton in September, even though her husband had to stay behind in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., because of his job. Her daughter, Lindsey, who is 5 years old, lost all her hearing by age 2. Just before entering Clarke's preschool, she received a cochlear (pronounced COKE-lee-er) implant last summer, in which an electronic device is surgically inserted into the ear to replicate sound signals.Because the new technology requires intensive follow-up work with the children to teach them to interpret the sounds, the Higginbothams chose Clarke for the individual attention it provided. Other Parents HelpAlthough it is hard living without her husband, Mrs. Higginbotham said a support group for new Clarke parents had eased the transition. \"They just took us in and made us a part of their family right away,\" she said, adding that Lindsey was happy and making progress.Dennis Gjerdingen, the school president, said the number of parents moving from out of state ballooned during the 80's. \"We've had as many as 19 families move in one year,\" he said. But those numbers have declined recently because of the recession, as families find themselves unable to afford the tuition.The Clarke curriculum is grueling for the children, who must learn not only their ABC's but the skills to speak them at the same time, said Alan Marvelli, the acting headmaster. Hearing children have years of listening and speaking before they learn to read.For this reason, schooling goes more slowly at Clarke. The school is divided into lower, middle and upper schools instead of grade levels. At age 17, graduates are usually ready to be \"mainstreamed\" into a high school of their choice, usually at the ninth- or 10th-grade level. Speech or Signing?Poor performance among the hearing-impaired children has kicked off a vigorous debate among teachers of the deaf about which of three methods is best -- signing, speech alone or a combination of the two, the so-called total communication method.The two dominant teaching methods since the 1950's, speech and total communication, have come under fire. Standardized tests have shown that the average hearing-impaired 18-year-old reads at a third- or fourth-grade level, said Arthur Schildroth, a researcher at the Center for Assessment and Demographic Studies at Gallaudet College in Washington.Teaching speech to deaf children \"works for only a handful of children,\" said Robert Johnson, chairman of the linguistics department at Gallaudet and co-author of \"Unlocking the Curriculum,\" a 1989 paper credited with prompting the current debate over how to teach the deaf.\"Most deaf people don't learn to speak very well,\" said Mr. Johnson, who advocates teaching American Sign Language before English or speech. Signing, he said, \"doesn't require any intervention, anything except getting them in contact with people who use it, and it can be acquired by age 5.\" So far, though, teaching signing as soon as children are identified as deaf is being attempted only experimentally, he said.While Mr. Johnson said the total communication method is an improvement over methods that rely primarily on speaking, it, too, has failed to raise achievement test scores. Teachers speak and use a different sign language, one designed to replicate each English word.\"When hearing people do this, they pay attention to what they are saying and assume the sign is fine,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"But usually the sign portion ends up being very incomplete,\" hampering a deaf child's ability to learn language.American Sign Language is not a transliteration of English words but an entirely separate language that can be learned on its own.But to parents at Clarke, teaching children to depend on sign language means shutting the door on any life outside a small deaf community.\"I feel it's a hearing world and there's not many people who know sign language,\" said Jean Thibodeau, who moved to Northampton from Newtown, Conn., with her deaf son, Justin, now 7 years old. \"No one would really understand him.\"On a recent evening, Justin ordered chocolate ice cream all by himself at a Friendly's restaurant. The person behind the counter understood him perfectly."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/18/science/science-watch-deafness-gene.html", "headline": "Deafness Gene", "date": "1992-02-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 18, 1992, Section C, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

People with the syndrome often have a distinctive appearance that can include a shock of white hair, wide spacing of the eyes or one eye a different color from the other.Only about 20 percent of patients have total hearing loss, Dr. Milunsky said. But anybody with the defective gene has a 50 percent chance of transmitting it to his or her child, in whom it may produce deafness, he said.Dr. David Edelstein of the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, who was not connected with the study, said the finding might aid in diagnosis and point the way to a treatment.The finding of the gene is reported in the current issue of the journal Nature. Researchers studied families with a history of the disease, and found that mutations in the gene were associated with appearance of the syndrome.One team included Dr. Milunsky and colleagues at the Boston University School of Medicine and Elias da Silva at the Federal University of Puernambuco in Brazil. The other team included researchers in Britain and Germany."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/08/us/sign-language-a-way-to-talk-but-is-it-foreign.html", "headline": "Sign Language: A Way to Talk, but Is It Foreign?", "date": "1992-01-08T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 8, 1992, Section B, Page 7Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Nuances of the LanguageLinguists point to a wealth of research published since the 1960's that supports the idea that American Sign Language is a language, with its own grammar and syntax. The basis of the langauge is gestural symbols that represent whole words or even sentences.The shape of the hand, its speed and direction and movements of the face, head and body are all part of the language. Raised eyebrows, for example, can mean a question.\"It has its own rules, ways of relating form with meaning and it has a grammar of its own,\" said Ursula Bellugi, a neuroscientist at the Salk Institute who is a leading researcher on sign language.Proponents of sign language as a foreign language also note that British sign language is not intelligible to a user of American Sign Language. British, French and German sign languages have different grammars, syntax and signs, different not only from each other but also from spoken English, French and German. But that does not resolve the question of whether it is a foreign language. A Matter of DefinitionThe Pacific Northwest Foreign Language Teachers Association, which represents about 2,000 foreign language teachers from seven Western states and Canada, recently voted against allowing American Sign Language to fulfill foreign language requirements.\"In no way do I impugn the integrity of A.S.L. as a legitimate academic subject or as a well-developed, intellectual, emotional, subtle, sophisticated language,\" said Dr. Howard Mancing, head of the foreign language department at Purdue University, where he turned down two students in their effort to have sign language courses counted as foreign language credits. \"It is all of that, but since it is American Sign Language it is not foreign by definition.\"Dr. Thomas Kerth, chairman of the German and Slavic languages department at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said: \"I think these people who talk about deaf culture and foreignness are using it in a metaphoric way, not literally, and when you get into the realm of metaphor the meaning gets obscured. Most would read a foreign language as one not spoken by Americans.\"C. Edward Scebold, executive director of the American Council of Foreign Language Teachers, said many educators now regard American Sign Language as a \"second language.\"In 1990 the council, which has about 6,000 members, recognized A.S.L. as a language but was divided on whether it satisfied an \"international\" component of language study. The council recommended that schools themselves make that determination. 'A 3-D Visual Language'Other educators are concerned about how to devise a scholarly curriculum that includes literature for a language that has no accepted written form and that exists temporally.\"The argument doesn't hold any water because we have a visual version of books, like talking books for the blind,\" said Dr. Roselyn Rosen, dean of the college of continuing studies at Gallaudet University in Washington, the nation's largest liberal arts college for the deaf. \"Sign language is a 3-D visual language. It's important to have it in motion.\"Dr. Wilcox, the University of New Mexico linguist, said sign language is like an oral culture, handed down from generation to generation. \"Most languages of the world are unwritten,\" he said. \"You can have literature without it being written.\"Many universities are grappling with the issue within their foreign language departments. Protest at Stony BrookLast spring, at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, someone made public an internal memorandum suggesting that the university re-examine whether the sign language course fulfilled the university's foreign language requirements. Scores of protesting students surrounded the office of Dr. Kerth, the German and Slavic languages professor who had sent the memo to other language teachers.Ronald G. Douglas, the vice provost of undergraduate studies, says that based on the forthcoming recommendations of a faculty committee he will decide the issue by March.\"I'm not sure SUNY was an anomaly,\" said Dr. James P. Lantolf, professor of linguistics at Cornell University. \"I think more and more states have to confront A.S.L. not just at the university level, but at the secondary school level.\"In the last decade, at least 11 states have passed legislation that recognizes American Sign Language as one that satisfies high school foreign language requirements.At least a dozen colleges and universities award foreign language credit for students who use the sign language. And the University of California system issued an advisory in 1990 to its nine universities, saying American Sign Language satisfied foreign language requirements."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/01/news/reporter-s-notebook-nbc-creates-series-standard-format-but-with-deaf-star.html", "headline": "Reporter's Notebook; NBC Creates a Series In a Standard Format But With a Deaf Star", "date": "1991-08-01T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 1, 1991, Section C, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The two men wore microphones. Ms. Matlin handed hers to her interpreter, Jack Jason.He sat a few feet away, below the stage, facing her. He translated the questions into sign language for her as they were asked, then translated her answers.This unusual and arresting press conference produced the desired result: It demonstrated that the new series, though using a conventional crime-drama format, is going to be unlike anything else on television. It is the first series to star a deaf actor.Ms. Matlin, who calls herself \"profoundly deaf\" (she can hear certain noises with a hearing aid) won the 1987 Academy Award for best actress in \"Children of a Lesser God.\" She says that since then she has not been able to find many worthy parts for a deaf performer.This series, which will be broadcast Fridays at 10 P.M., was created for her. In it she plays an assistant district attorney who wants to function without limitations in court and in processing cases. Mr. Harmon plays a police officer assigned, over his objections, to work with her because he had a deaf father and learned the basics of signing.The prospects for the series clearly will turn on how accepting viewers are of the use of sign language between the main characters. In the series much of her dialogue will flow through Mr. Harmon, who learned how to sign for the series. She will speak only occasionally.The premise creates some obvious problems. Mr. Singer said the show must be written so that the audience will know what Ms. Matlin is saying through Mr. Harmon's responses. He will not be translating her dialogue except when a third person is in the scene.Then there is the question of language censorship -- Ms. Matlin's, not Mr. Harmon's. Ms. Matlin said one colorful expression she signed in the pilot was edited because her fingers got too explicit.Ms. Matlin said that when she was a child, she liked to watch television \"like every little girl,\" looking for characters she liked, male stars she found appealing. She never knew what they were saying because that was before the days of closed-caption television shows.But she said through Mr. Jason: \"It was O.K. If somebody wasn't in the room to tell me in sign what was happening, I just made up my own story to go along with the pictures.\" The process helped stoke her imagination, she said.Now she sometimes sees one of those stories again with closed-caption dialogue and, she said, \"I'm always amazed how different the real story is.\"CBS, feeling especially spirited by its improvement in the ratings thisyear, had a party to close its section of the television press tour. Many of the network's stars attended.It was at an amusement area in Burbank, where the attractions included video arcade games, miniature golf, a wide range of batting cages (slow, medium, fast and VERY fast) and a go-cart track.Few CBS stars were game enough to get in the cage for a few swings. Burt Reynolds of \"Evening Shade\" said: \"People still think of me as an athlete. I don't want to blow that.\"But the entire cast and creative team of \"Murphy Brown\" (minus Candice Bergen, who was still in France) took a spin in the go-carts and exhibited some viciously competitive driving. Jeff Sagansky, the president of CBS Entertainment and the man being credited with restarting the network's engine, mingled in exceedingly relaxed fashion. He still wore his double-breasted suit, but he had removed his tie.Mr. Sagansky did announce that CBS would make a six-hour sequel of its hit mini-series \"Lonesome Dove\" and that one of his key programming moves in the first week of the television season next September will be to show the two-hour pilot for the series \"Us,\" which was Michael Landon's last television performance. A few days later, Warren Littlefield, NBC's president of entertainment, announced his network's early-season scheduling gambit: a tribute to Michael Landon, all of whose previous series were on NBC. Young Pursue Stars, Young PapparazziNBC did not schedule a similarly spirited event, but it did stage a press opportunity for beat reporters from the teen-age media. Labled \"Hot Shots,\" the event was an occasion for writers and photographers from such publications as Teen Magazine and Tiger Beat to get their first glimpse of the teen-agers and pre-teen-agers NBC is working into its shows this fall.The event also brought out some participants in a new Hollywood phenomenon: kid papparazzi. Whenever a star of some renown -- such as Wil Smith, who stars \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air\" -- was due to show up, the hotel corridors started to fill with packs of photographers in shorts and sneakers.It got especially intense on the afternoon that ABC gave a party for its Friday night lineup of kiddie shows. Jodie Sweetin, the 9-year-old star of the hit ABC comedy \"Full House\" (she plays Stephanie, the middle of the three Tanner sisters), was swarmed over by one pack, who closed in and all but squashed her against the wall in one hotel corridor.Ms. Sweetin maintained her poise and signed autographs while making sure all the photographers had the shots they needed.\"It happens all the time,\" she said later. \"Especially if I'm going to make an appearance. I don't mind, except sometimes when I'm just walking through the mall and somebody recognizes me and then they're all over the place.\" A Quirk SurfacesWhat's in a Name? Surprise!Since the demise of \"Twin Peaks,\" the television show most celebrated for its offbeat style is CBS's \"Northern Exposure,\" which is becoming a budding hit on Monday night at 10. The writing-producing team who created that series, Joshua Brand and John Falsey, have a new fall series for NBC, \"I'll Fly Away.\" Set in the South in the 1950's, the series is a character study of a principled prosecutor dealing with civil rights cases, and his family, which has a new black housekeeper.Mr. Brand said this show might have trouble matching the attention being given to \"Northern Exposure.\" As he said: \"It lacks quirkiness. Quirkiness seems to be in.\"The series stars Sam Waterston in a role that is by no accident reminiscent of Atticus Finch, the principled lawyer in \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Mr. Waterson has twice recently played Abraham Lincoln, once in \"Gore Vidal's Lincoln,\" once only in voice, in the PBS series \"The Civil War.\" In this series his character is named Forrest Bedford. His older son is named Nathan.In a twist that Mr. Brand said was a sheer, bizarre coincidence, the juxtaposition of those names conjures up a reference to one of the most famous Southern commanders of the Civil War, Nathan Bedford Forrest, who is credited with having killed more men face to face in the war than any other soldier. He also went on to become one of the founders of the Ku Klux Klan.Mr. Brand said: \"We had absolutely no idea that the names would make people think of Bedford Forrest. It was a pure accident.\" However, when the unexpected quirk was brought to his attention, he said: \"We have to use that connection now. For a lifelong resident of the South to have that name has to have a story to it. We're going to have to explore that now, I think.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/01/nyregion/police-accuse-deaf-man-of-killing-another.html", "headline": "Police Accuse Deaf Man of Killing Another", "date": "1991-04-01T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 1, 1991, Section B, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Tina S. Morhmann, said the victim, Nelson Santiago, 25 years old, of 1912 Avenue H in the Flatbush section, had been drinking with another deaf man, Ismael Echevarria, 25, in Mr. Santiago's apartment when Mr. Echevarria killed him with a kitchen knife.Mr. Echevarria, of 465 St. Mark's Place in the Brooklyn Heights section, had also sniffed cocaine and become frenzied, the police said. He cut Mr. Santiago's brother, Luis, 23, on the hand and foot, and cut Luis Santiago's wife, Loirda, 22, on the hand, Sgt. Mohrmann said. The couple, who also live in the apartment, were taken to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan and were in stable condition, she said.Sergeant Mohrmann said Mr. Echevarria began attacking his victims as they lay in their beds.\"Luis and Loirda attemped to defend Nelson, and then they received the wounds,\" said Officer Scott Bloch, a police spokesman.

Those demonstrations, though carried out in a silent flurry of sign language, constituted nothing less than a civil rights revolution for the deaf, who for centuries had felt that the hearing world treated them as helpless children with some terrible debility. New President, New DealWhen the protests were over, Gallaudet had the first deaf president in its history, which dates to its Federal charter in 1864; its 2,400 students, and for that matter deaf people everywhere, had a new sense of pride and accomplishment; and the hearing world was beginning to understand the campus battle cry: \"Deaf people can do anything -- except hear.\"The revolution continues today. \"The demonstrations of March 1988 changed the way this nation views deaf people, and that change goes on,\" said Roslyn Rosen, a Gallaudet dean who is president of the National Association of the Deaf, the country's major organization that lobbies for people with hearing problems.The change has been fractious. There is no unanimity among the deaf on what targets to attack next and how to attack them. There is disagreement over whether the hearing should have any role at all in operating schools and colleges for the deaf. There is disagreement on how to achieve better and earlier schooling for deaf children; many still leave high school with minimal skills in reading and writing. And there is disagreement, as there has been for more than a century, on whether the deaf should learn to communicate with signs or by reading lips and mouthing words or by some combination of methods.Like most wars, the war of equal rights for the deaf has turned into something of a grind after the heady victories of 1988. \"There are many hard battles to fight before final victory,\" said Dr. I. King Jordan, who became Gallaudet's first deaf president after the demonstrations in 1988. \"Still, we have come a long way and very much has been accomplished. We will push on.\" 'I'm Going for It'Congress has enacted new laws to help the deaf, deaf people are moving into more administrative jobs in education and government, and more and more deaf people are casting aside shyness and hastening to join the struggle to wipe out discrimination and patronization.\"Many deaf people used to have a 'can't do' approach to life, but now many more have a 'can do' approach,\" said Tim Rarus, a 1988 Gallaudet graduate who helped lead the protest and now works on Capitol Hill as a Senate aide. Like most deaf Americans, he speaks to the hearing in sign language, through an interpreter.\"People who used to say they would be satisfied to be a clerk now say they want to be a lawyer or a doctor,\" Mr. Rarus went on. \"I myself just took the exam for law school. I'm going for it.\"Dr. Jordan is more than a university president. He is a hero and a role model for other deaf people, spending much of his time traveling the country, urging the deaf to speak up and the hearing to listen. Forty-seven years old, he lost his hearing in a 1968 motorcycle accident, and still uses his voice to speak to the hearing.\"When he walks into a room to speak, he usually gets a standing ovation,\" said Jack R. Gannon, a Gallaudet official who has written several books about the deaf. \"He's the living symbol of the revolution.\"The federally chartered university gets three-quarters of its funds from Congress. The lawmakers have not only responded generously toward it but have passed a number of new laws aimed at making life easier for the two million Americans who are deaf, half a million of them since birth or early childhood. Breaching a Silent BarrierBeginning in 1993, all television sets sold in the United States will have to be equipped with devices that enable deaf viewers to watch programs with captions. Many programs are captioned now, but the captions cannot be seen unless the viewer installs a decoding device. The devices cost several hundred dollars and are too complicated and unwieldy to haul on a vacation or business trip.Under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, telephone companies will be required to have operators who can \"talk\" to deaf people with teleprinters, starting in 1993. The idea is to provide deaf people with someone who can relay teleprinter meassages by voice to hearing people.Since the Gallaudet protest, at least a dozen members of Congress have hired deaf staff members. Robert Davila, who is deaf, has been named an Assistant Secretary in charge of the Education Department's Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.\"What deaf people need to do next is make sure that all this progress continues, especially in schooling for the deaf,\" said Frank G. Bowe, an education professor at Hofstra University. He was chairman of the Congressional commission that studied the education problems of the deaf three years ago and concluded that the schooling available was \"unsatisfactory, unacceptably so.\"Dr. Bowe said the country must find ways to identify children with hearing problems at an earlier age so no time is lost in schooling. Then, he added, more care must be taken in determining the type of education.\"Different deaf children need different approaches,\" he said. \"The choice depends upon factors like the extent of hearing difficulty, whether parents are deaf, whether a local school system is really set up to handle deaf students, whether a state school for the deaf is nearby.\"More care must be taken, too, to follow government regulations designed to help the deaf obtain schooling, and more attention must be given to job training and technological advances such as TV decoders. Finally, more deaf teachers and more deaf administrators must be hired, both because they know the problems best and because they serve as role models.\" The Next BattlegroundOn the 100-acre Gallaudet campus, a mile northeast of Capitol Hill, students who took part in the revolution of 1988 still struggle with where to attack next, and how.The major issue right now is an old one in deaf education -- proficiency in English. Because the deaf learn English in a number of ways, some through one form of sign language, others through a second form, still others through lip reading, students arrive at Gallaudet with widely varying skills. One sign language is so different from English in its dependence on symbols that many users consider English a second language.Gallaudet requires that all its graduates read and write English proficiently. Most of its professors are not deaf, and many have limited proficiency in sign language. All this has led to sharp tension on the campus as the elation of the 1988 revolution subsides.A month ago, Carl Dupree, a student active in the English dispute, got into an argument with an English instructor. Security officers were called; Mr. Dupree was handcuffed, making it impossible to communicate by signing. Soon after, he collapsed and died.Law-enforcement and university authorities are still investigating the incident. But some Gallaudet students say the investigation, whatever it uncovers, will not change their view that the university remains insensitive to some needs of the deaf despite all the progress since March 1988."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/12/garden/making-pay-phones-friendly-to-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Making Pay Phones Friendly to the Deaf", "date": "1990-12-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 12, 1990, Section C, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Or,\" he added gesturing to his friend and fellow student, Jason Shaw, \"make hotel reservations.\"Like college students across the country, the two young men were making arrangements by phone for a holiday trip. But this phone, the object of Mr. Alvord's enthusiasm, was equipped with a telecommunications device for the deaf, a tiny screen with a keyboard on which Mr. Shaw, who is also deaf, was typing.Telecommunications devices for the deaf, or TDD's, have been around for more than a decade and about 200,000 have been sold. They look and operate much like word processors that are linked, allowing the callers to type messages to each other. Portable ones, costing from $180 to $500, are similar to laptop computers.But the marriage of TDD's to pay phones is new and expected to give the nation's 22 million deaf and hearing impaired the flexibility and accessibility that people who can hear take for granted: the ability, for instance, to call a taxi, a hotel or home when stranded in a strange city.At Gallaudet, the university for deaf and hard-of-hearing students, 40 pay phones have been equipped with TDD's, leased for $850 to $900 a year, in an experiment by Bell Atlantic and Telecommunications for the Deaf Inc., a 22-year-old advocacy organization based in Silver Spring, Md. The one-year test is meant to determine the durability and security of the machines under everyday, heavy public use.\"Pay phones in general take a lot of beating,\" said Kenneth Pitt, executive director of media relations for Bell Atlantic. \"Will they be ripped off? Will they hold up under heavy use?\" The experiment is not limited to the 40 phones at Gallaudet, which are in various buildings on campus, including dormitories. The devices have been set up at Union Station, in the United States Capitol, the Library of Congress, the House and Senate office buildings, at the Amtrak station in Baltimore, and at National and Baltimore-Washington airports. The phones, made by Ultratec , a company in Madison, Wis., will remain once the experiment is over.A similar Bell Atlantic test is under way in Pennsylvania, with phones in 11 major transportation centers in Philadelphia, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Allentown and Wilkes-Barre.Though there are several hundred TDD-equipped pay phones nationwide, that number is minuscule compared with the total number of pay phones. \"That level of accessibility is a few years away,\" said Cindy Hanson, communications manager for Ultratec.Extending the use of TDD's also requires Federal and state approval of the altered phones. For example, something as simple as lowering the height of a pay phone for callers in wheelchairs requires state approval.Justin Dart Jr., chairman of the President's Commission on Employment for the Disabled, called the special phones just the \"iceberg tip\" of technology to help the disabled. \"Just envision a telecommunications system that involved a computer, a TDD, a fax, a television and a telephone,\" said Mr. Dart, who uses a wheelchair. \"Such devices exist now. Imagine one in every home and telephone booth, not only for deaf and disabled people but for everyone.\"How far we are away from it depends on the priority we have about installing it,\" Mr. Dart added. \"Whether we have the will and determination to make this happen. Once we as a nation decided to go to the moon -- and that was much more difficult than this -- we did it in a fairly short time.\"On the Gallaudet campus, students make use of today's technology. Through a translator, Jan Nishimura, Mr. Alvord, a junior, explained Mr. Shaw's call last month. \"Four or five of us are going to Lancaster, Pa., for the Thanksgiving break,\" he said.Mr. Shaw turned from the keyboard and screen that slides out in a drawer under the phone. Two nights or three? he wanted to know. Two rooms or one? Mr. Alvord signed back. Mr. Shaw returned to the keyboard and punched away.Half a dozen students, including Nancy Bonura, a 27-year-old senior from Philadelphia, were waiting to use the phones. Gesturing ennui and exhaustion, she said, \"I wish there were a whole bank of these phones.\"Many hearing people do not realize how rich language is or how animated a face and body can be until they have a conversation with a deaf person. But that richness is lost on a telephone, whichAlexander Graham Bell invented in 1876 to help his deaf wife communicate. The device revolutionized communications but was of no immediate help to her or other deaf people.If you are deaf or the person you are calling is deaf, a call back to the restaurant where a coat was left, a call for help, the calls for everything from doctors' appointments to dinner reservations -- these are not the instantaneous, spontaneous experiences that they are for the hearing.\"Accessibility,\" said Rohan Smith, a senior from Toronto, when asked about the TDD's. \"We don't have these in Canada and that's what these machines mean: accessibility. Hearing people can use a public phone any time and any place. Now when I walk by those phones, I can just pick up the phone and make a call. That's freedom.\"There are limitations if the recipient of a call does not have a TDD. In that case, the deaf can use a relay service, which involves a three-way conversation between a deaf caller with a TDD, the recipient of the call and a hearing operator with a TDD.Relay services are now available in 34 states, including New York and Connecticut, although some are limited to emergency use, said Mr. Pitt of Bell Atlantic. Under Federal Communications Commission rules, all states must have centers by July 1993 and every state but Wyoming has at least begun planning.\"When you use a relay service, there's a great deal of frustration,\" Mr. Alvord said. Though the cost is the same as for any comparable phone call, the deaf person must call a hearing operator, often a volunteer, although phone companies do run some centers. The operator then places the call for the deaf person, and stays on the line, relaying the conversation between the two parties.\"It can take you 30 minutes to get through,\" Mr. Alvord said. \"Then you're limited to three calls, and if the line is busy, you've got to hang up and wait another 30 minutes. A lot of times I wish that I were hearing.\"Mr. Alvord, who is from St. Louis, has two personal TDD's but doesn't have to carry them where he has access to TDD-equipped phones. \"I think the TDD has really opened up a whole new world for Allen,\" said his mother, Mary Alvord. \"He's much more independent than in the past. He's able to call without a middle person, which means he's coming closer to being able to act like a hearing person.\"Mrs. Alvord said that calls made through relays are often strained. \"It is very cold,\" she said. \"How much are you going to say when you've got a third party listening and doing the talking? With a TDD you're much freer to talk. And it's much easier to get hold of people when you can call directly yourself.\"This is her son's first year at the university, Mrs. Alvord said, and without the special phones \"he wouldn't be calling.\"\"Now he calls twice a month,\" she added. \"Of course, my phone bill would be smaller, but we wouldn't have that personal contact.\"James Tucker, the 31-year-old director of admissions at Gallaudet, , remembers growing up outside Boston. He was the 10th hearing impaired person in his family. Then, teletypewriters or TTY's, which printed directly onto paper, were few and far between.\"We were probably the second family in Massachusetts to have a TTY,\" Mr. Tucker said. Even after a while, he added, \"there weren't many other people who had them -- they were that expensive.\"So on Sunday, my parents and my brothers and I, when we wanted to visit some friends 30 miles away, would get in the car and drive over. Then if they weren't there, well, shucks, that was just the way it was. All that journey for nothing.\"Mr. Tucker, who does some recruiting for the school, said the convenience of TDD pay phones all over the nation, which is still several years away, would be a boon. \"I usually carry my own TDD,\" he said. \"But that's extra luggage -- about 30 pounds -- and awkward, especially when I'm carrying recruitment material as well.\"Once, he recalled, he arrived at the San Francisco airport late one night. He had to take a shuttle to a car-rental agency to pick up a car to drive to his hotel 20 miles away.\"You know those little courtesy phones that you pick up and request a ride?\" Mr. Tucker said. \"Well, between me and my car was this phone. There was no one around and I tried to talk as best I could, but it didn't work.\"Then I saw a janitor and I gestured and he caught the gist, but he wasn't fluent in English, so it took him some time to convey what I wanted to the operator. I lost 30 minutes and my blood pressure probably rose by as many points. My nightmare is a late plane, or an early plane, and no telephone access.\" Want More Information?

Galloway, as superintendent of the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf, was the latest in a series of hirings of deaf superintendents sought by lobbyists for the deaf community across the nation.Ms. Galloway, the assistant principal of the Maryland School for the Deaf, Columbia Campus, will take over on Jan. 1 as the ninth superintendent of the Katzenbach School in West Trenton. Formerly called the New Jersey School of the Deaf, the 275-student institution covers pre-nursery through 12th grade.Ms. Galloway was selected from 48 candidates and three finalists, at least one of whom was hearing-impaired. \"Katzenbach's students will benefit from her two decades of distinguished work as a teacher and administrator in deaf education,\" said the New Jersey Commissioner of Education, John Ellis. 'Things Long Overdue'\"We're very pleased with what we accomplished,\" said Phillip Nicoll Moos, a member of the Alumni Association. He participated in a rally at the Department of Education in Trenton, a letter-writing campaign and a petition drive to press for consideration of deaf candidates. \"Its the first deaf superintendent and the first woman in 107 years, both things long overdue.\"\"We felt that a role model was very important to the students,\" Mr. Moos said.\"It indicates from now on, it is not a matter of how a person looks,\" Dr. Harvey J. Corson, provost of Gallaudet University in Washington, and the former superintendent of the Louisiana School for the Deaf, said through an interpreter. \"It shows a change of attitude in people, and hastens the day when deafness will no longer be considered a hindrance.\"According to educators, the matching of deaf or hearing-impaired superintendents to schools for the deaf has been fueled in part by pressure from deaf people who have begun to demand greater representation. In the Last Five YearsIn the last year, deaf candidates have been selected to fill superintendents' posts at state-financed schools in Illinois, Mississippi and Rochester.According to a recent survey by Winfield McChord Jr., the executive director of the American School of the Deaf in West Hartford, Conn., and an adviser to the Katzenbach search committee, nine superintendents of the nation's 65 schools for the hearing impaired are deaf, and all of them have been appointed within the last five years.\"The hiring of deaf superintendents is a phenomenon of only the last four or five years, when 15 schools changed superintendents mostly due to retirements,\" he said.Inspiration for the campaign to consider deaf candidates for the Katzenbach post came from the events at Gallaudet University two years ago, where protestors forced the resignation of a hearing president and the appointment of a deaf one."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/16/us/new-law-will-expand-tv-captions-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "New Law Will Expand TV Captions for the Deaf", "date": "1990-10-16T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 16, 1990, Section A, Page 22Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

It would affect television sets sold in the United States no matter where they are manufactured.Costly decoding devices are now used to turn the signals into captions that convey dialogue at the bottom of the screen, much like subtitles that accompany a foreign film. When the bill becomes law, television sets sold with 13-inch screens or larger will be required to include the technology that displays the captions. The words on smaller televisions are too difficult to read.The television industry and supporters of closed captioning agree that the technology will add $3 to $10 to the cost of a set once the chip is mass produced. About 20 million televisions are sold in the United States every year.A Victory for the DeafPassage of the bill is a victory not only for the estimated 22 million Americans who are deaf or hard of hearing, but also for millions of people who are struggling with English as a second language or have literacy problems.''We are very happy,'' Charles C. Estes, executive director of the National Association for the Deaf in Silver Spring, Md., said through a translator. ''This is one of the parts of life that deaf people have not been permitted access to until the last 10 years, and then only in a very limited way.''While all prime-time programs and an increasing number of other broadcasts are being captioned, few deaf people have decoders, which cost roughly $200. Based on sales of the machines, it is estimated that fewer than 10 percent of those who have hearing problems have access to closed captioning.The legislation, co-sponsored by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, was overwhelmingly supported by members of Congress and a number of actors and actresses who testified on its behalf before Congressional committees this spring. The Senate passed the bill on Aug. 2, and the House approved it two weeks ago.Shift by TV IndustryInitially the Electronics Industries Association opposed the move on the ground that the chip developed by the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation would raise the cost of a television set by $20, imposing a regressive excise tax.But the industry group changed its position in August after lawmakers agreed to give manufacturers more time to develop their own chip technology, lowering the cost, said Gary Shapiro, a vice president of the electronics association.With a grant from the Federal Government, captioning made its debut with Julia Child's ''French Chef'' on public television in 1972.''But it didn't really fly,'' said Larry Goldberg, director of the Caption Center at the public television station WGBH in Boston, one of five groups that caption programs. The first captioning was not closed, he said, so all viewers saw the words on the screen.Decoder Boxes IntroducedCaptioning became more commercailly acceptable after 1980, when the National Captioning Institute of Falls Church, Va., introduced decoder boxes that limited the service to those who wanted it.At first it was a struggle to persuade the television networks that there was a need for captioning, Mr. Goldberg said, but today the service is part of the media mainstream. All prime-time programming is captioned, and cable and home video are slowly adding the service to their selections.Captioning has also been a windfall for those who have no hearing problems. Educators say captioning is a highly effective tool in teaching adults to read and in teaching English as a second language.In a study of Asian-American students in the seventh and eighth grades with a poor grasp of English, researchers at the University of Lowell in Massachusetts found that the students learned significantly more new words when closed-captioning was used in conjunction with instructional television segments.A New Pool of Viewers''They see the word 'respiration' on the screen; they see the visual context of the word; then they hear it in the course of the dialogue,'' said Susan B. Neuman, now an associate professor of reading at Temple University. ''After watching these segments over a three-week period, students learned 76 percent of the words, far more than the other students.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/13/business/ibm-system-to-help-the-deaf-use-telephones.html", "headline": "I.B.M.

The synthesized voice is transmitted through the phone system, and the listener spells out a response on a push-button telephone keypad. The responses appear on the deaf person's computer screen.The system is expected to increase the tasks that deaf people can perform at home and in the workplace, allowing them to conduct conversations with anyone who uses a Touch-Tone telephone. Similar System DiscontinuedAlthough I.B.M. said the device was the first of its kind, a similar system was introduced in 1980 by Ultratec, one of the largest makers of telephone products for the disabled. That company quickly discontinued its product after users complained that it took too long for people to type responses on telephone keypads. In addition, the company said people who were not deaf were reluctant to use the system.An I.B.M. spokesman said the company was unaware of the Ultratec device.The I.B.M. system will compete with existing telecommunications devices for the deaf, known as T.D.D.'s. These allow deaf people to communicate with one another through the use of small video screens with keyboards that are hooked into the telephone network. To conduct a conversation, both the caller and the person being called must have a T.D.D.The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, a leading distributor of telephone systems for the deaf, said it plans to offer a service within its long-distance network early next year that will translate a deaf person's typewritten words from a T.D.D. into synthesized speech. Operators as Go-BetweensA number of phone companies, including A.T.&T., have begun relay services in which an operator acts as a go-between for a hearing-impaired person using a T.D.D. and someone who can hear who has a regular telephone. The operator receives a message typed by the deaf person on a computer screen and the operator reads the message to the person on the other end of the line and then types the response back to the T.D.D.''If the new technology is effective in facilitating communication, it should increase employability of deaf persons, particularly at the managerial level,'' said Merv Garrettson, interim executive director for the National Association of the Deaf, based in Silver Spring, Md.He continued: ''Will it enhance their regular lives? Most deaf people lead very busy, exciting and happy lives. Of course, the added accessibility to the telephone would be helpful for both hearing and deaf people.''More than 21 million people are classified as deaf or hearing-impaired. I.B.M. said its market research indicated that the device could allow about a million people to be employed in jobs in which they were previously unable to work. Uses Keys to Spell WordsBusiness & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0Feb. 4, 2022, 1:43 p.m. ETHere\u2019s what you need to know about the January jobs report.Architects at a prominent New York firm drop their unionization bid.Hertz hires a former Goldman Sachs finance chief as its C.E.O.The I.B.M. system, which is called Phonecommunicator and runs on an I.B.M. personal computer, begins each new conversation by explaining that a deaf person is on the line. The system also gives instructions on how to communicate with the deaf person using the Touch-Tone keypad.The computer system is designed to identify words spelled by callers pressing keys, corresponding to the alphabet, on the Touch-Tone keypad. Since each key represents three letters, a caller might press keys that spell more than one word. If this occurs, the computer presents the various words and allows the deaf person to choose the appropriate word for the sentence being formed.For example, a caller wishing to spell ''dog'' would press 3-6-4; but the letters corresponding to those keys could also spell ''fog,'' so the computer would present both words to the deaf person in the sentence that has already been formed, as in ''Please feed the fog/dog.'' The deaf person would choose the appropriate word.''It's a very long and tedious way to communicate, and I am skeptical that many people will get involved in long conversations, but at least it's a good start at developing contacts between deaf people and the general population,' said Al Sonnstrahl, executive director of Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf Inc., a group that advocates communications improvements for the deaf and that publishes a telephone directory of people with T.D.D. numbers. ''The device that deaf people really need is one that is portable and translates and recognizes voices - but that's a long way off.''I.B.M. said the new system was immediately available at a cost of $600; the cost of an I.B.M. or I.B.M.-compatible personal computer, also needed to use the system, would start at roughly $800. A.T.&T.'s telecommuncations devices for the deaf are priced between $185 and $480.I.B.M. said the technology was developed to meet the needs of its hearing-impaired employees. The company has also marketed Screen Reader, which uses a synthesized voice to read to blind or visually impaired people the information that appears on their computer screens. Little Profit SeenMore than 20 companies manufacture telephone products for the deaf, and analysts estimate that there are about 200,000 devices in use. Because the market is fragmented and relatively small, analysts said I.B.M. stands to make little profit from the device.Philip Bravin, an I.B.M. product administrator who is deaf and uses the Phonecommunicator in his work, said I.B.M. had decided to develop specialized products ''to use its technological strength to give handicapped people as fair of a chance to participate and work in society as anyone else.''Cindy Hanfon, a spokeswoman for Ultratec, which took its similar Superphone off the market several years ago, said I.B.M. was ''reintroducing something that wasn't very popular a decade ago.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/30/nyregion/school-district-is-ordered-to-assist-deaf-parents.html", "headline": "School District Is Ordered to Assist Deaf Parents", "date": "1989-11-30T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 30, 1989, Section B, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

He said most school districts willingly supply sign-language interpreters.The parents, Kenneth and Karen Rothschild, are deaf, Mr. Charmatz said; their children, a fourth grader and a high school senior, are not. Parents Paid for InterpretersSince the early 1980's, the parents have sought an interpreter so they could participate in parent-teacher evenings and consult with school district personnel concerning their children. They have also retained sign-language interpreters at their own expense, paying an estimated $2,000 through the 1988-89 school year, the decision says.They sought relief under the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which says any organization receiving Federal aid cannot discriminate against the handicapped.The school district claimed that the parents did not qualify under the act because they were not students.Judge Goettel said that the act's regulations define reasonable access as including a sign-language interpreter for a deaf person otherwise qualified to participate in an activity. He added, however, that the district's obligation ''is limited to school-initiated conferences incident to the academic and-or disciplinary aspects of their child's education.''''To the extent that the plaintiffs wish to voluntarily participate in any of the plethora of extracurricular activities that their children may be involved in,'' he wrote, ''we think they, like other parents, must do so at their own expense.''Reacting to the decision, Mr. Chamatz said, ''It's a pleasure to have parents interested in programs and interested in their kids these days when there's so much talk about lack of interest.''Lawyers for the school district did not return several calls to their offices."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/11/us/health-psychiatry-treatment-plan-for-deaf-overcomes-language-culture-barriers.html", "headline": "HEALTH: Psychiatry; Treatment Plan for Deaf Overcomes The Language and Culture Barriers", "date": "1989-05-11T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 11, 1989, Section B, Page 17Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Shapiro, coordinator of the program. She is a clinical social worker who counsels deaf patients and their families.Dr. Alvin I. Gerstein, director of the program, said about 10 percent of the 500,000 people who are profoundly deaf have mild to major mental health problems. The problems range from depression to serious psychoses.Mental health care workers say deafness does not cause mental illness, but there are some problems, like isolation and depression, that are intensified by deafness.One concern of the doctors is that deaf people are less likely to seek treatment, for a variety of reasons. In particular, Dr. Gerstein said many deaf patients worry about confidentiality, especially if an interpreter is used. In many areas, the number of deaf people are relatively small and a patient may know the interpreter.On a more practical level, deaf people often have trouble, especially if they live outside major cities, in finding mental health professionals capable of helping them. The Philadelphia center is one of only about a dozen private in-patient mental health care programs for deaf patients in the country. Separated by ProblemsUnlike some mental health hospitals that take deaf patients but segregate them, the Philadelphia center mixes the deaf patients with the hearing patients in treatment. The patients are separated by problems. Deaf gamblers, for instance, are treated with gamblers who can hear.Hospital officials say the keys to their program for the deaf are the use of sign language and a sensitivity to the culture.The program for treating deaf people employs about 10 staff members who know American sign language; they wear special signs on their hospital badges to make it easier for the deaf patients to identify them.The program can accomodate up to six deaf patients at a time. Their treatment can include individual and group therapy as well as other types of treatment. At night, the deaf patients are given time to be with each other. After their release, the patients are usually involved in regularly therapy sessions at the hospital on an outpatient basis.Deaf people were often misdiagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic or psychotic in the 1950's, said Patrick Brice, the director the mental health counseling program at Gallaudet University in Washington, the nation's only college exclusively for deaf students. He said that a standard question on pschological tests ask if the patient hears voices. Some deaf people will answer affirmatively because the have hearing aids and think the question is asking them if they have the ability to hear.Dr. Knast said he helped create the program after he grew frustrated because area hospitals could not handle the deaf patients he sent them. 'They Gave Me Hassles'Others have also encountered similar frustration when trying to find adequate mental health care. One woman who sent her troubled deaf son to the program remembered her anxiety when she initially could not find a hospital that would admit him.''They sort of gave me hassles,'' said the woman, who did not want her name used. ''I was saying the kid needed help.'' Fearing that her son was suicidal, she kept a vigil over him for a few nights while he slept, until a high school counselor helped her find the Philadelphia treament center.For Ms. Shapiro and other therapists who hear, providing therapy in a foreign language to people from a different culture is perhaps the greatest challenge.Although Ms. Shapiro considers herself fluent in sign language, she said, ''There are times when I feel I am missing some of the nuances that are so important to good therapy.'' Hearing therapists must spend time in the deaf community, she said, because ''you have to find out what is and is not in the range of normal.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/03/us/help-for-deaf-jurors.html", "headline": "Help for Deaf Jurors", "date": "1989-05-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 3, 1989, Section A, Page 20Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

At the same time, Mr. Yonaiyama's lines are being spoken by another actor in English - and immediately translated into American sign language. In the actual performances, though, the only spoken words are in Japanese.When Mr. Yonaiyama's American co-actors from the National Theater of the Deaf in Chester, Conn., speak or sign their roles in the Tokyo International Theater Festival here, the whole process is reversed. The festival continues through Wednesday; the theaters of the deaf will perform in Osaka for one night. 'Somehow, It All Works'''When you think about it, it should all be a confusing mess,'' the American group's artistic director, David Hays, said during a rehearsal. ''But somehow, it all works.''In fact, it does, and the success of this largely deaf cast from India, Japan, China and the United States seems to prove that sign language is less of a barrier on stage than the spoken word.Although spoken Japanese and English have about as much in common as sashimi and hot dogs, American and Japanese sign languages share fundamental concepts.''I think it must be easier to understand English sign language than English itself,'' the 36-year-old Mr. Yonaiyama said through a sign-language translator.The deaf actors in the American and Japanese acting companies were soon chatting, and by late afternoon during one recent rehearsal it became clear they were already on each other's wavelengths. Festival Is in IkebukuroThe festival is in the Seibu Theater in Ikebukuro, a jammed commuter hub and shopping area in northwest Tokyo. The Japan Theater of the Deaf, a small company founded eight years ago, opens its part of the program with a Kyogen, a traditional Japanese comedy often performed during the intermission of Noh, or dramatic, plays.The American actors perform improvisations based on spoken and sign-language suggestions from the audience, with Mr. Yonaiyama and another deaf Japanese actor, Tetsuya Izaki. Both trained with the American group in Connecticut.The highlight of the program is ''In a Grove'' by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, a tale of rape, betrayal and suicide that was the basis of Akira Kurosawa's film ''Rashomon.'' The story is told through the testimony of a woodcutter, a priest, a policeman, a bandit and others involved in a bizarre encounter in the woods. The one-at-a-time nature of the testimony - in which each of the participants gives a different version of the truth - helps to simplify the problem of multiple translations. Selecting the Play''I chose the play because the testimonies are individual, and the parts can be developed,'' said Mr. Hays, a former set designer for George Balanchine who first came to Japan in 1960 as a technical adviser to the Kabuki theater.But Kabuki is one thing to the Japanese, and deaf actors are another. It is rare to see physically disabled people on the subways and buses in Tokyo; physical handicaps are viewed here as a family stigma, and the disabled are often kept at home.That is changing slowly in Japan, and Mr. Hays and his troupe are trying to speed the process. ''When we first planned to come here, agents told me that Japanese would not come to the theater to see deaf actors,'' Mr. Hays said. ''They would be afraid that if they were seen, people would assume their families had someone at home in the closet.'' Popular Actress AppearsSo far, the crowds have been encouraging. And this performance has an added drawing card: Tetsuko Kuroyanagi, an immensely popular actress and talk-show host, who has become a major force behind the Japan Theater of the Deaf. She appears in one of the few speaking roles.Along with her are a few actors and actresses from theaters of the deaf struggling to begin elsewhere in Asia. Among them is Wang Ling, a young business school graduate from Beijing who is fulfilling the dream of his late father, Wang Zhentai.When the National Theater of the Deaf went to China in 1986, Wang Zhentai spoke in Mandarin as the company performed in sign language. He then started a theater of the deaf in China and brought several Chinese performers to the National Theater's summer school in Connecticut. He died last August, shortly after returning to China, and his son picked up the effort as a tribute to him. Winning Recognition''The Chinese bureaucracy is so huge, and they had never heard of a theater for the deaf before,'' Wang Ling said. But he has begun to win recognition for the group, and he persuaded the Chinese authorities to allow a young deaf factory worker, Yang Ling, to join in the Ikebukuro festival.An actor and an artistic director from India, which uses the American sign-language system, are also involved.''I've never seen anything quite like this,'' said the artistic director of the Indian group, Zarin Chaudhuri, an actress from Bombay.''Yesterday it looked impossible,'' she said. ''Today it is all coming together.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/27/theater/dramatic-presentations-by-theater-of-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Dramatic Presentations By Theater of the Deaf", "date": "1988-07-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 27, 1988, Section C, Page 17Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

In testimony before a Senate communications subcommittee this year, he accused the Corporation for Public Broadcasting of, among other things, being unprofessional and often using panel processes that virtually guarantee mediocre programming. ''Personal politics, the buddy system, jealousy and pop ideology dominate the panel deliberations,'' Mr. Wiseman maintained.The point here is that Mr. Wiseman is passionately dedicated to his work and is no pushover for those who might impede him. There is an unquestioned integrity about the man and his films. Public television's feelings may be bruised, but the system winds up carrying Mr. Wiseman's latest nine-hour-plus opus. ''Deaf and Blind,'' a project that began in 1984 at the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, consists of four parts, each running over two hours. They are being shown on Channel 13 over four consecutive evenings. ''Blind'' was broadcast last night. ''Deaf'' is being offered at 10 tonight.The basic Wiseman techniques have changed hardly at all over the years. The subjects are institutions: a high school, a hospital, a welfare center, a race track and a monastery, among them. Using no narration, the films wander about their settings, picking up representative details and listening in on conversations and conferences. Viewers are not told about these places; they are taken there and made privy to their inner workings and dynamics. Inevitably, reactions vary dramatically. For some, the excursions, lacking the standard guideposts of familiar news documentaries, can be exasperating. For others, including this writer, the cumulative experience is nearly always memorable.It's not as though Mr. Wiseman cannot seem almost perversely challenging at times. There are long scenes in ''Deaf and Blind'' that are just about incomprehensible, as students communicate with one another through sign language or a combination of signing and inarticulate sounds. And there are drawn-out scenes with multi-impaired youngsters that can be truly painful to watch. There is occasionally the suspicion that the film maker is trying to saddle his audience with guilt, making a holier-than-thou accusation that if you can't take it, there is something lacking in you. But then again, no one has ever accused Mr. Wiseman of being easy or mindlessly comforting.In ''Deaf and Blind,'' he has composed an extraordinary document that opens up worlds far removed from the prime-time television universe of eternally happy and healthy faces beaming radiantly while consuming soft drinks and burgers. The Alabama Institute, which has five campuses in Talledega, has 1,300 students, all deaf or blind or both. Some are retarded and will need help all their lives. Many, however, will learn a vocation that will let them live independently. The staff of 600 teachers and administrators includes disabled people.On the surface, this is a special and very different world. But Mr. Wiseman is constantly discovering how ''normal'' it is. The ''Deaf'' segment tonight has an extended scene in which a boy, after threatening to commit suicide, is called to a conference with his mother, a counselor and the school director. The conversation goes round and round, gradually touching on everything from divorce and demanding children to frustrated parents and concerned outsiders. It's a scene that could take place at any school across the nation. But in this instance, the student is deaf.And so the series goes, focusing on vocational training in ''Adjustment and Work'' tomorrow and on more difficult situations in ''Multi-Handicapped'' on Friday. Small triumphs are recorded in learning how to make change in coins or how to fold a washcloth. Passing faces are allowed to become familiar. The interracial harmony of the school is a model for all institutions. And the devotion and skills of the staff are positively inspiring.If a time capsule were prepared today for opening in a couple of hundred years, ''Deaf and Blind'' would be an ideal choice for inclusion. There's no doubt that a society is reflected in its institutions. The Alabama Institute catches us at our most caring and compassionate moments."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/21/movies/review-television-inside-a-school-for-the-blind-and-deaf.html", "headline": "Review/Television; Inside a School for the Blind and Deaf", "date": "1988-06-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 21, 1988, Section C, Page 20Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

But you wouldn't know it from the documentaries of Frederick Wiseman. Beginning in 1967 with ''Titicut Follies,'' which was filmed at a Massachusetts institution for the criminally insane, Mr. Wiseman has developed a personal film-making style that is as uncompromising as it is distinctive. There is no narration. There are no collages. The camera simply opens up on a scene and stays there, watching for as long as it takes to convey what Mr. Wiseman judges to be the essence of the situation.Over the years, Mr. Wiseman has visited contemporary institutions ranging from a welfare center to a high-fashion modeling agency. Now, in a series of four films running for a total of more than nine hours, he brings us inside the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, which was founded in 1858 and is a model in education for the disabled. The series, called ''Deaf and Blind,'' will be shown over four consecutive evenings on Channel 13. Tonight's premiere, a 2-hour-12-minute film (Mr. Wiseman even resists tidy time slots) entitled ''Blind,'' begins at 10 o'clock.It would, admittedly, be easy to convey the basic facts about the Alabama Institute in the kind of typical 15-minute essays that can be found on television's standard ''news magazine'' programs. Mr. Wiseman is after something else. With John Davey as his cameraman, he doesn't simply tell you about the school. He takes you inside and makes you feel what it is like to be one of the teachers or administrators. He even conveys a sense of what it is like to be disabled. He comes as close as is probably possible to producing a television equivalent to what Christopher Nolan, the mute, spastic and brain-damaged Irish writer, accomplishes in his extraordinary book ''Under the Eye of the Clock.'' These documentaries draw us into the world of the disabled, helping us see and feel what it is like to be blind or deaf or multiply handicapped. The experience is certainly not designed for easy consumption.Each of the four ''Deaf and Blind'' films begins with brief scenes outside the school, scenes of the ''normal'' life that seems blithely oblivious to the extraordinary things taking place inside the school. Tonight, ''Blind'' opens at a car race, the Winston 500, where the school's concert band is part of the pre-show entertainment. A minister tells the blind musicians, ''Christ is the one that can fill you, even if you're blind, or whatever.''Entering the school, we find Jason, a small bundle of determination who would be perfect for all those movies Mickey Rooney made as a child. Jason is blind. From the second floor of the building, he has to deliver something to a teacher on the first floor for the first time. ''I can find the way,'' he says, and the camera follows him all the way down and back, simply staying close to him as his fingers flick the walls for a sense of direction and place. In normal circumstances, the scene would be commonplace. In this context, Jason is heroic.And so Mr. Wiseman begins wandering the corridors and classrooms, stopping to watch lessons in Braille or sewing or the piano. There are the model students and the troublemaking students. Some are completely blind; some are partly sighted. They write patriotic essays about ''What America Means to Me,'' and they express concerns about having manners and respecting the elderly. They learn how to walk with a cane and how to clean a kitchen table after a meal. Throughout, they are taught, counseled and guided by what appears to be in most respects a remakably capable and dedicated school staff, some members of which are blind themselves. Amid the soft Southern drawls of both students and staff, racial integration is simply taken for granted.The series continues at 10 P.M. tomorrow with ''Deaf,'' at 10 Thursday with ''Adjustment and Work,'' and at 10:20 Friday with ''Multi-Handicapped.'' That is undoubtedly a lot of Wiseman to digest in a relatively short time. Weekly or even monthly broadcasts of the ''Deaf and Blind'' would probably have been better. Mr. Wiseman does indeed continue to be demanding and difficult.

They also said that, contrary to the past view of many doctors, the devices can safely be used in children who are only 2 years old, after careful evaluation.Cochlear implants have been a subject of research and controversy since the early 1960's, when they were developed. In recent years their use in patients has increased substantially. To date, more than 3,000 of the devices have been implanted in patients throughout the world, most of them in the United States.The device is primarily for people whose hearing is so profoundly impaired that they get virtually no benefit from conventional hearing aids. The experts said there was still a controversy on many issues concerning the devices, but for some patients they provide significant benefits. Draft Consensus Report''Cochlear prostheses are good and are going to get better,'' said Dr. Robert I. Kohut, chairman of the conference at which the implants were discussed. He is a professor of otolaryngology at the Wake Forest University Medical Center and the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C.The panel's conclusions were set forth in a draft consensus report issued today at the end of the conference at the National Institutes of Health. The two-and-a-half-day meeting was part of the institutes' long-standing program of inviting panels of experts to develop consensus statements for the medical profession on important, rapidly changing fields of medical and surgical practice.Cochlear implants offer the hope of some sound perception, and even speech recognition, to people who, as one speaker phrased it, might or might not hear pistol shots close to their heads. But there are some limitations to the hearing improvement.For a profoundly deaf person it is an important benefit to be able to hear a car approaching or a door slam, conference participants said. Moreover, the device enables some patients to carry on at least limited telephone conversations. Most have significant improvement in their ability to hold face-to-face conversations with the help of lip reading.At a news conference, a patient who had a cochlear implant in 1981 spoke warmly of the benefits. Although profoundly deaf for several years, he is now able to communicate effectively, he said, and he demonstrated it at the microphone. The patient, Irwin Schumacher of Washington, said voices sounded a little like radio broadcasts that were full of static. And he said a phrase such as ''How are you?'' was likely to sound like, ''Ba ba boo.'' Auditory Nerve StimulatedThe cochlea is a structure in the inner ear shaped like a snail shell, where sound vibrations are translated into nerve impulses that then go to the brain through the auditory nerve. The implants essentially bypass hair cells in the cochlea to stimulate the auditory nerve directly.Typically, the device consists of a receiver, like a conventional hearing aid, a speech processing minicomputer and a receiver implanted under the skin behind and above the ear. The processing computer, carried on the belt or in a pocket, translates sound signals into an electrical form that is picked up by the receiver.In some devices the internal receiver protrodes through the skin; in others it does not. From the internal receiver a thin wire cable is threaded through the mastoid bone and into the cochlea. Electrodes transmit electrical signals, which stimulate nerve cells and are interpreted as sound by the brain.Some of the devices are called single channel because they stimulate in only one location. Others are multiple-channel devices that break sound down into different frequencies and then provide electrical stimulus to various parts of the cochlea.There is still some difference of opinion among experts as to the relative merits of the designs, but the draft statement said that for adults the multiple channel implants ''may have some superior features'' over the the single-channel devices.Two devices have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the last two years: a single-channel implant developed by the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles and the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company of St. Paul, and a multi-channel device developed by Nucleus Limited, an Australian company with subsidiaries in the United States.There are many other devices in various stages of development and testing. The total cost of an implant, including the device, the surgery required and various aspects of patient evaluation and testing, is often as much as $20,000, speakers at the conference said. Use in Children DebatedIn the early years of cochlear implant development their use in children was controversial. Some doctors argued that the devices might hinder the child's natural physical and psychological development.But the panel of 14 experts said implants in children as young as 2 years old were permissible provided there was careful evaluation of the child's needs and problems before the implant. Among other things, the panel recommended a minimum trial of six months with a conventional hearing aid for a child before deciding to go ahead with the implant. It is estimated that about 300 children throughout the world have received such implants.The panel said it was still not possible to predict which potential recipients would benefit most from cochlear implants, but candidates are generally restricted to patients too profoundly hearing impaired to benefit from conventional hearing aids.Of the 15 million people in the United States with significant hearing impairment, the panel said less than 1 percent were potential candidates for a cochlear implant.The meeting was sponsored primarily by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke, a unit of the National Institutes of Health, and the institutes' Office of Medical Applications of Research. SOUNDS FOR THE TOTALLY DEAF An implanted device can bring sound to people whose deafness results from defects in the minute hair cells in the inner ear that normally convert sound vibrations into electrical signals. The device translates sounds into electrical signals and transmits them directly to the auditory nerve, which carries information to the brain. A microphone picks up sounds and a processor divides them, in this model, into four frequencies. Signals are radioed through the skin to antennas and, after processing, are sent as electric impulses to the cochlea, where they are transmitted to the auditory nerve. The person may hear little more than static, but this can help with lip-reading, and newer models that break sound and signals into many frequencies are improving sound quality."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/27/nyregion/return-of-children-to-deaf-mother-is-ordered.html", "headline": "Return of Children to Deaf Mother Is Ordered", "date": "1988-04-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 27, 1988, Section 2, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The mother had had trouble finding housing after leaving her husband, who lawyers said was abusing her and the children. The city removed the children after she moved back in with him.The release yesterday followed a ruling last week by the judge, Justice Elliott Wilk of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, that faulted the city for failing to help keep the family together and avert the need for foster care. 'Systemic Deficiencies'''Even with court intervention, the city is unable to meet its constitutional and statutory duty to provide preventive services,'' the judge said. ''It appears that this inability is attributable to systemic deficiencies, including inadequate programs, procedures, training, staffing and coordination, rather than individual worker error or misjudgment.''The children were first taken away from their mother last November and held for three weeks after reports that she was having trouble caring for them in a shelter for battered women where she had been living.They were returned to her after city officials said the workers who removed the children had not followed proper procedures and had not tried to explain to the mother that her children were being taken away.Marcia Robinson Lowry, the director of the Children's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the children, said that since then city foster-care workers had made almost no effort to help the mother find an apartment or take care of her children. ''They have never had a sign interpreter to talk to her,'' Ms. Lowry said. ''They communicate with her through her mother.'' Appeal May Be FiledAnn Ormsby, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources Administration, said that the city was considering filing an appeal in the case and that it had tried to help the mother.According to an account given by Ms. Lowry, the woman, identified in court papers as Mrs. F., stayed in the shelter for battered women for three months, the maximum permitted by the state, and then moved back into her mother's overcrowded apartment, which she shared with a sister and the children.When she sought city help in finding an apartment, a city worker took her to look at a building in which no apartments were available. When she found an apartment on her own, the city was unable to provide money for rent and security until after the apartment was rented to someone else.Last week, after problems in the mother's apartment, the woman decided to move back with her husband, who, Ms. Lowry said, had been abusive to the woman and her children. Given a ChoiceAt a hearing before Justice Wilk last week, the city gave the woman a choice between moving into a welfare hotel or placing her children in foster care. When the woman refused to go to a hotel and moved in with her husband, the city removed the children.Last week, after Justice Wilk ordered the children returned, the city appealed and began separate proceedings in Family Court seeking an order authorizing placement of the children in foster care.When lawyers from the Civil Liberties Union objected, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ordered the city to hold a hearing on the city's decision to take the children or release them by yesterday.But at the hearing yesterday, Judge Richard M. Palmer of Family Court decided to defer to Justice Wilk's decision and ordered the children released.Ms. Ormsby said that city workers has shown the woman ''three or four'' apartments and that she had turned down a city-owned apartment, according to the case worker. Ms. Ormsby also said city workers had helped the woman find a program for deaf parents at New York Foundling Hospital."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/21/books/books-for-deaf-find-a-wider-market.html", "headline": "Books for Deaf Find a Wider Market", "date": "1988-04-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 21, 1988, Section C, Page 29Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

''Our sales have just boomed because of that,'' Dr. Costello said.The reason for the recent popularity, she added, is that ''the stigma of deafness is fading.''''People are really fascinated with sign language and the idea of deafness, and bookstores and book clubs are recognizing that,'' she said. Moreover, only a handful of companies publish for the hearing impaired. Leaving Red Ink BehindAs a result, the Gallaudet press was self-supporting last year, for the first time. 'Before, we'd always gotten subsidies from Congress through the university,'' Dr. Costello said. ''But sales were well over $1 million last year and we'll do $1.5 million this year.''It publishes about 10 new titles a year, and its 125 titles in print include everything from ''Legal Rights of Hearing-Impaired People'' to ''The Hispanic Deaf'' to ''Ear Gear,'' the last a student workbook on hearing and hearing aids. Gallaudet took over publication of ''The Comprehensive Signed English Dictionary'' by Harry Bornstein, Karen L. Saulnier and Lillian B. Hamilton, a book that had been published on campus some years before, and more than 100,000 copies are now in print.Most Gallaudet books sell to libraries and to professions in the field of deafness and in such related areas as speech pathology and audiology. But sales to general audiences continue to increase. ''The bookstores and book clubs haven't bought everything we've published, but they have taken thousands upon thousands of copies,'' said Pat Hurt-Rienburg, director of marketing for the press. For the Young and the OldThe Literary Guild bought ''My First Book of Sign,'' by Pamela J. Baker, illustrated by Patricia Bellan Gillen, a full-color alphabet picture book for introducing sign language to children.Waldenbooks bought ''Belonging'' by Virginia M. Scott, a novel about a popular student who became deaf at age 15. After the book's 3,000 hard-cover copies sold out, Gallaudet published 10,000 paperback copies.A Macmillan book club bought almost 4,000 copies of ''Communication Disorders in Aging,'' edited by H. Gustav Mueller and Virginia C. Geoffrey.Moreover, book clubs as well as general bookstores are likely to be interested in ''I Didn't Hear the Dragon Roar'' by Frances M. Parsons. Ms. Parsons, who teaches art history at Gallaudet, crossed China in 1986 by plane, train, cart, riverboat and on foot, visiting not only the major cultural sites but local schools for the deaf as well."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/13/us/deaf-actress-s-use-of-speech-proves-divisive-among-peers.html", "headline": "Deaf Actress's Use of Speech Proves Divisive Among Peers", "date": "1988-04-13T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 13, 1988, Section A, Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Misrepresentation FearedGary W. Olsen, president of the 26,000-member National Association of the Deaf, which was founded in 1880 to fight a proposed ban on sign language, applauded Miss Matlin's use of sign language, but he expressed concern that her sudden and complete switch to speech might ''misrepresent the success of oral education.''Tom Humphries, associate dean of San Diego Community College, and himself deaf, said some criticism of Miss Matlin from the deaf was even harsher.''She's choosing to focus on a stereotype that deaf people had tried to avoid, the whole idea that deaf people have to speak to be successful,'' Mr. Humphries said. ''That's offensive to many people, including me, but I understand it, that it was the way she was raised and the way she feels.''A spokesman for Miss Matlin said the actress had carefully planned her presentation to draw attention to the abilities of the deaf.In ''Children of a Lesser God,'' Miss Matlin, who lost her hearing as a child, played a deaf woman who resists efforts to teach her to speak. She is also to play a deaf person in the CBS Television movie ''Bridge to Silence,'' to be filmed this summer.But she plays a hearing woman in the Paramount motion picture ''Fox,'' to be filmed this fall, her spokesman said. Pivotal Issue of LanguageDavid Wolfe, a representative of Gallaudet University, said the debate has shifted among the deaf from whether to use sign language or speech to what form of sign language to use. Supporters of American Sign Language, an original language with its own grammar, oppose the use of hand codes that recreate English.The importance of the debate is not to be underestimated, said Harlan Lane, a psychologist and author of the 1984 book ''When the Mind Hears: A History of the Deaf.''''Language is the pivotal issue among the deaf,'' Mr. Lane said. ''The question is whether English will be the only way for them to communicate or whether they will be allowed to use their minority languages, much as in the debate over bilingual education.''While the ability of the deaf to use their voices is limited by the severity of their hearing impairment, many deaf people now prefer to combine speaking and sign language as conditions demand or permit, said Marcella M. Meyer, president of the California Association of the Deaf.''We have to accept deafness and be interested only in bringing up healthy children if they are deaf,'' Ms. Meyer said, adding that, though she is able to speak, she always uses sign language as well ''for clarification.''''I prefer to be understood,'' she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/22/us/panel-calls-education-of-deaf-unsatisfactory.html", "headline": "Panel Calls Education of Deaf Unsatisfactory", "date": "1988-03-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 22, 1988, Section A, Page 32Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Bowe, chairman of the Commission on Education of the Deaf, said in testifying on a report by the commission that made 52 recommendations in educating the deaf. ''We still have high school graduates reading below a third-grade level,'' Mr. Bowe told the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee's Subcommittee on the Handicapped.The 13-member commission, established by Congress in 1986, concluded that the Department of Education should consider placing deaf students in special schools or centers for the deaf instead of forcing them to compete with their hearing counterparts.''Those of us who are deaf have had access to some form of education, but it's not been a good one and it's not getting better,'' said Mr. Bowe, a regional commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration. Gains in Techniques SeenBesides Mr. Bowe, two-thirds of the panel's members are deaf. The panel is made up of Government officials and educators of the deaf.The report also recommended that a majority of the board of trustees of Gallaudet University be hearing impaired, which was a demand made by students at the school for the deaf in protests earlier this month.The commission concluded that significant improvements had been made in techniques for educating the deaf since 1965, when a Federal panel last suggested changes. But it also said that ''the actual implementation of these changes has been inadequate and sometimes misguided, and that progress has been at best sporadic.''The panel found that 95 percent of the nation's deaf students have had no hearing since birth or have been deprived of it in infancy; it recommended improvements in identifying these children and teaching them English. Post-Secondary EducationThe commission also called for expansion of post-secondary education programs, including vocational and technical training as well as junior college and college programs. There are now two colleges in the nation for deaf students, and four regional post-secondary programs.In addition, the commission recommended that the department include American Sign Language, the language of most of those born deaf, under the Bilingual Education Act, which would treat it like any other foreign language. This would give deaf students access to special training programs other foreign-language students now receive.Establishment of a National Institute on Deafness as part of the National Institutes of Health is another priority of the commission, along with the creation of a National Technical Insititute for the Deaf at Gallaudet.The commission also urged Congress to pass legislation requiring the Federal Communications Commission to issue rules making new televisions capable of decoding closed-caption broadcasts. Until those sets are common, decoders should be distributed free, the commission said.The commission took 20 months to interview deaf education specialists, students and school administrators before making its 144-page report.A House panel will hold hearings on the study next week, and Senate and House committees will work with the Department of Education to establish some of the proposed changes."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/16/obituaries/rev-john-fletcher-87-ministered-to-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Rev.

The deaf - not just students but also faculty members and alumni and, in the end, people around the nation - demanded that the hearing surrender to them control of what is perhaps the foremost university in the world for the deaf. Remarkably, they achieved almost all their demands, and in the just a single week. How? Why? Complex Explanation Their campaign was well planned. It was run with sophistication. The opposition seem alternately insensitive and impolitic. But the explanation for the success of the protest is considerably more complex than that.At first glance, it seemed to center on Gallaudet and academia. In fact, Gallaudet was only a convenient symbol, a bitterly ironic place that boasted of a special ability to train deaf people for the working world but itself refused to hire a deaf person for its top job.Gallaudet, which had been set up to help solve a problem, had become part of the problem. In acting, the protesters served notice from its grounds that deaf people everywhere, not just at Gallaudet, were weary of being treated like children, that they were tired of paternalism and condescension, even ''oppression'' by the hearing.They said they wanted control of their own destiny and that Gallaudet University, run by people who could hear for all its 124 years, was where they intended to take the first step toward seizing that control. The Appeal SnowballsIt turned out to be an exceptionally appealing call to arms, appealing to an extent that fooled even the protest organizers. Within hours the students who had started the protest had been joined by a majority of the faculty. Then the Gallaudet alumni climbed on board, followed by consumer groups, labor unions and politicians.Gallaudet, in the larger sense, was a protest whose time had come. It is now clear that the protesters, particularly the students who initiated the demonstration that shut down the campus for the week, were the shock troops in the first major battle of a national campaign to obtain more civil rights and opportunities for the nation's millions of deaf people.Specifically, the protesters took strong exception to an effort by the university to install still another president who had no hearing impairment and did not know sign language. She was Elisabeth Ann Zinser, a highly regarded North Carolina educator.The protesters were unmoved by her considerable reputation. How, they asked, could someone like that, however qualified as an academician and administrator, truly understand Gallaudet? How, they asked, could such a choice be made? Inadequate ResponsesThe answers that came back not only did not satisfy the protesters but also infuriated them. In retrospect, they were answers that also helped the protesters achieve their victory. At best many were tinged with unawarenessabout the deaf and, at worst, with outright insensitivity.The chairwoman of the Gallaudet board, Jane Bassett Spilman, argued steadfastly that a person who was not deaf could run a university for the deaf as well as anybody. She steadfastly maintained that the board, made up like most university boards of the wealthy, influential and issue-oriented, need not be reconstituted even though only four of its 21 members had hearing difficulties.Then, in what was perhaps one of two break points in the dispute - the other came when more than half the faculty came out against Dr. Zinser's appointment - Mrs. Spilman was quoted as saying that ''deaf people are not ready to function in a hearing world.'' Initially she denied the quotation. Later she said she had mistakenly used a ''double negative,'' mistakenly leaving the impression she held such an opinion.Then came the faculty vote, a well-timed move that Dr. Zinser subsequently acknowledged made it almost imperative that she pull out. She did, announcing her decision at 1 o'clock one morning, in keeping with the confusion surrounding the Gallaudet situation. What the Protesters WonThe results of Sunday's board meeting were perhaps the most surprising development of all. For in the end, the protesters won almost all of their demands.They got a new president, I. King Jordan, dean of the Gallaudet School of Arts and Sciences, and a new board chairman, Philip Bravin, a New York business exceutive, both of whom are deaf. They also won a promise that the board would be restructured to include more deaf people. And they even won a promise of amnesty for all who had participated in the protest.But this time an explanation was offered for the board's actions, and it could not have been a more rewarding one for the protesters. The board said it had misread the situation.The Gallaudet protest victory has given heart to the deaf all across the country and, because of the national coverage the protest received, the protesters say the hearing people of the country now know and understand considerably more about the deaf and their problems and needs."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/14/us/school-for-deaf-picks-deaf-chief.html", "headline": "SCHOOL FOR DEAF PICKS DEAF CHIEF", "date": "1988-03-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 14, 1988, Section A, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

King Jordan, Dean of the Gallaudet college of arts and sciences, to be the eighth president of the 2,200-student institution. The 124-year-old university has never before had a deaf president.The board, in meeting nearly all the demands of protesting students, alumni and faculty members after a week of unrest on the campus, also elected a new chairman, Philip W. Bravin, who has a hearing impairment. It also set up a study commission to consider ways to restructure the board. Changing the WorldThe outgoing chairwoman, Jane Bassett Spilman of Bassett, Va., resigned, acknowledging that her leadership had become too controversial and that she needed to ''remove the obstacle.''After the announcements, Greg Hlibock, a New York City resident who is president of the student body, said in sign language, ''I feel out of this world.''Roz Rosen, Dean of the College of Continuing Education, said: ''God made the world in seven days. We changed it in seven days.'' The protests that shut down the school and sparked a national movement for rights for the deaf began a week ago after the board tried to install a president who had no hearing problems. Dr. Jordan was one of two hearing-impaired candidates passed over when the Gallaudet board chose Dr. Elisabeth Ann Zinser to be Gallaudet's seventh president and the first woman in the post. Faced with the vehement protests and a vote by a majority of the faculty members siding with the students' demands, Dr. Zinser resigned Friday.In announcing the appointment of Dr. Jordan, the new president of the board, Mr. Bravin, an International Business Machines Corporation executive from New York, said the 44-year-old dean had told him earlier in the evening ''he is really pleased and ready to work.''Later, Dr. Jordan appeared at a student rally and said: ''It's a historic moment for deaf people in the world. We will no longer accept limits on what we can achieve. Students showed us that we can seize an idea with such force that it becomes a reality.''While elated student leaders told the new administration that they wanted to begin discussions to bring the campus back to normal, it was not clear when they would begin because the school has begun spring break. But most students seemed to have remained on campus. End of Protests PromisedMr. Bravin said he also had been told by the leaders of the protest that the unrest would end, ''not tomorrow but now.''In a statement, the board reiterated Mrs. Spilman's promise that there would be no disciplinary action against the protesters.During the protests, Dr. Jordan initially backed Dr. Zinser but later, after a majority of the Gallaudet faculty had come out in opposition to her, sided with the protesters.In the weeklong impasse at Gallaudet, a federally chartered and supported institution situated on a 100-acre campus about a mile northeast of Capitol Hill, the coalition of protesters had demanded not only that Dr. Zinser be replaced by a hearing-impaired president but also that Mrs. Spilman be replaced and that the board be restructured so that at at least half of its members are hearing-impaired. Only four of the 21 trustees have hearing problems.Mrs. Spilman said initially that she would not resign unless asked to do so by the board. Tonight she said she went ''willingly'' but did not elaborate except to say her departure was ''in the best interest of the university'' because she had become so controversial.She had contended throughout the protest period that a person who is not deaf could run an institution for the deaf effectively. But she acknowledged she was surprised by the outburst the Zinser appointment caused. Protesters Praise ZinserDr. Zinser resigned the president's post after being on the job for only five days and without setting foot on the campus. She returned to her previous position as vice president of academic affairs at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, saying the Gallaudet protest was a ''civil rights movement'' whose time had come.This morning, the protesters released a copy of a letter they sent to Dr. Zinser in which they praised her for a ''graceful exit'' and wished her ''great success in future endeavors.''''History as it evolves is often difficult to grasp, but this time is the time for a 'revolution,' '' the letter said. ''You were, of course, an innocent victim and an unfortunate target of our collective anger. We will continue to fight for our cause until our demands are met. We will have our day in the sun.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/10/us/many-in-faculty-back-protest-by-deaf.html", "headline": "Many in Faculty Back Protest by Deaf", "date": "1988-03-10T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 10, 1988, Section A, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Others in attendance abstained.Despite the faculty move, the university's governing board refused to back down from its decision, which has become a focal point for a national movement seeking more opportunities and rights for the deaf and hearing impaired.The protesters say the time has come to give hearing-impaired people more leadership positions in the United States. They have chosen for their battlegound a university that prides itself in being one of the world's foremost training centers for the deaf but has never itself had a president with hearing problems. Campus Is Shut DownGallaudet, a 124-year-old school on a 100-acre campus a mile northeast of Capitol Hill, is fully accredited, has a major sports program and looks like many universities except for the constant sign-language exchanges among students and faculty.For a third day, the campus was shut down by the protest, in which most of Gallaudet's 2,200 students have demanded the resignations of the new president, Elisabeth Ann Zinser, and the chairwoman of the Gallaudet board of trustees, Jane Bassett Spilman.They also called for a new board, with a majority to be people with hearing problems. Four current members, the minimum under the school's by-laws, are hearing impaired. All but three of the 21 board members are appointed by the board itself on a revolving schedule.The students have also insisted that once protests end, no reprisals be taken.Shortly before the faculty meeting, Dr. Zinser, who was vice president of academic affairs at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro when on Sunday she became the first woman chosen as Gallaudet's president, told a news conference that she would not step aside, whatever the faculty decision.Dr. Zinser, who has said she is learning sign language, pleaded for an unfettered opportunity to work with the school's students and faculty to show that she could do the job. But she also warned that she would not tolerate protests indefinitely, answering ''not long'' when asked how long she would wait. 'Best Candidate' SoughtAt the same news conference, Mrs. Spilman, declared that the board also had no intention of backing away from its decision. ''The board continues to reaffirm its support for Dr. Zinser,'' Mrs. Spilman told reporters, saying it sought ''the best qualified candidate, not necessarily a deaf candidate.''The faculty decision came at the end of a third tumultuous day on the Gallaudet campus, where demonstrating students have shut down classes and blockaded most campus entrances and buildings.''It's our Selma,'' Kathy Karcher, a 29-year-old graduate student said tonight as she stood near the university's main gate with fellow demonstrators, referring to the 1968 civil rights protests in Alabama. ''We're going to keep this up until we win.'' Support for StudentsBesides faculty members, many Gallaudet alumni and leaders of many national organizations that serve the deaf have sided with the students. Some members of Congress, which founded the university and provides it with most of its money, have publicly called upon the school's board to pay attention to student demands.A number of student and faculty leaders, as well as the Dr. Zinser and Mrs. Spilman, went to Capitol Hill today to meet with key legislators. Under the school's charter, three of the 21 trustees must be members of Congress. The current trustees from Congress are Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, Representative Steve Gunderson, Republican of Wisconsin, and Representative David E. Bonior, Democrat of Michigan.Today's faculty decision meant, in effect, that when Dr. Zinser was installed, she would face not only a solidly hostile student body but also a faculty that is, at a minimum, split evenly over whether to support her.''This is going to make it very difficult for Dr. Zinser to lead because she won't have at least half of us with her,'' said Prof. Frank Zieziula, chairman of the Department of Counseling, after the vote. ''In the eleven years I have been here, I've never seen such support for any issue. And I know of nothing else like this in academia.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/09/us/campus-protest-by-the-deaf-is-widening.html", "headline": "Campus Protest by the Deaf Is Widening", "date": "1988-03-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 9, 1988, Section A, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

But they said their concerns were larger than the appointment of the school's president. The message was that, like the civil rights movement and the women's movement, theirs is a cause for reform. 'This Is Our Time'''I'm not going to let my deaf rights get hurt,'' Eric Spanbauer, a 26-year-old student, told The Associated Press today. ''I've been waiting too long. This is our time.''Among those from outside the universitywho showed up, seemingly serving notice that the protest was becoming a national cause, was Gary W. Olsen, executive director of the National Association for the Deaf.''The board doesn't understand the people it's governing,'' Mr. Olsen said, speaking in sign language that an interpreter put into speech. ''The board is further behind on this issue than the population of the country in general. The school educates the deaf to lead, then won't give deaf people a chance to lead. We're tired of oppression and we're going to fight this all the way and make the issue a torch of hope.''Classrooms at the university, a fully accredited institution with a broad curriculum and a competitive sports program, reopened this morning after being closed Monday because of demonstrations. But it appeared that few of the university's 2,200 students and only a scattering of its faculty members showed up. Board Stands by DecisionThe protest began late Sunday night shortly after the Gallaudet board announced that it had chosen Elisabeth Ann Zinser, vice president of academic affairs and a professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, to be the seventh president of the 124-year-old university, whose 100-acre campus lies about a mile northeast of the Capitol. Two candidates for the position who had hearing impairments were passed over.The protests have been almost non-stop since then. But the 18 members of the Gallaudet board, three of them deaf, have given no indication thus far that they intend to back off. ''The board of trustees has made its decision, has announced it and stands by it,'' Jane Bassett Spilman, the board's chairwoman, said late this afternoon in a telephone interview from her home in Bassett, Va.According to Mrs. Spilman, the board looked at the qualifications of 67 persons before deciding on Dr. Zinser. ''I'm not saying there is no one out there who is hearing impaired who can do the job,'' Mrs. Spilman said. ''I'm saying that the board found no one who was hearing impaired in the group of names that was brought forward who met the needed qualifications.''Late tonight, the university announced that Mrs. Spilman and Dr. Zinser would be in Washington on Wednesday for a news conference. ''They will explain the reasoning behind the board's decision,'' a school spokesman said. Appointee Learning to SignThe school has about 275 full-time faculty members; about a third are deaf or hearing impaired. It has never had a president with serious hearing problems, according to school officials.All staff and faculty members are required to learn sign language. School officials said Dr. Zinser was learning to sign. Jerry C. Lee, who was the sixth president, left the university at the end of 1987 after three years as president to become vice president of Bassett Furniture Industries Inc., which is run by Mrs. Spilman's husband.When it became known that Dr. Lee would be leaving Gallaudet, some students and faculty members began to press openly for appointment of a deaf or hearing impaired person as the next president.One of the leaders of the most recent protests, Jerry Covell, a 23-year-old senior from Bowie, Md., said that demonstrations would continue as long as it took to force the board to reverse its decision. ''We will stay out of the classroom forever if we have to,'' he said, speaking, like most students, in sign language through an intepreter.Many of the protesters are looking to Congress for help. Gallaudet is a federally chartered school and receives more than three-fourths of its operating budget from Congress. As of today, however, Congressional reaction had been limited.During one rally in front of the main gates of the school today, protesters vowed not to end their demonstrations until four demands had been met. First and foremost, they said, the seventh president of Gallaudet would have to be hearing impaired. They also called for Mrs. Spilman's resignation from the university's board and appointment of a new board with one half of its members deaf. And they said the school administration must promise that there would be no reprisals against any student or staff member involved in ''our historical movement.''Among those who joined the protesters today was Gerald Burstein, the president of the Gallaudet University Alumni Association. ''The Gallaudet University Board's decision to select a hearing president is a setback for deaf people everywhere,'' he said. ''If Gallaudet does not exert leadership in this area, no one else will.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/08/us/college-for-deaf-is-shut-by-protest-over-president.html", "headline": "College for Deaf Is Shut by Protest Over President", "date": "1988-03-08T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 8, 1988, Section A, Page 20Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Dr. Zinser, who is 48 years old and the first woman chosen for the post, was named over two other finalists, both of whom are deaf.Immediately after the board's announcement Sunday night, hundreds of students marched from the college's campus in the northeast section of Washington to the Mayflower Hotel downtown where trustees were meeting.Jane Bassett Spilman, chairwoman of the board, told the protesters that Dr. Zinser had been selected because ''she is a uniquely talented educator who would best lead Gallaudet as we face very challenging times.'' Monthslong EffortShe acknowledged that Dr. Zinser has had no experience with deaf people, but said she was a ''caring person.''Dr. Zinser, who has a doctorate in educational psychology from the Unviversity of California at Berkeley, a master's in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a bachelor's in nursing from Stanford, said Sunday night that she was learning sign language, and that she did not consider the protest a personal attack. Repeated telephone calls to her home today were met with a busy signal.Harlan Lane, visiting professor at Gallaudet and a professor at Northeastern University in Boston, said that a campaign to have a deaf person appointed as president has been underway for months. ''There were two very qualified deaf applicants,'' he said.I. King Jordan, 45, dean of the college of arts and sciences, and Harvey J. Corson, 44, superintendent of the Louisiana School for the Deaf in Baton Rouge and a Gallaudet trustee, were the other finalists.Material distributed by students said the appointment of another hearing president at Gallaudet was as ''unacceptable'' and ''paternalistic'' as having a white president appointed at Howard University, the predominantly black college here.Dr. Zinser is the third president named at the university in the last four and half years. Her predecessor, Jerry C. Lee, left last September to become a vice president of Bassett Furniture Industries Inc., in Bassett, Va., which is run by Mrs. Spilman's husband. Mr. Lee's predecessor, Lloyd Jones, served three months at the end of 1983. 'Not Ready to Function'In her remarks Sunday night, Mrs. Spilman justified the selection, saying, ''Deaf people are not ready to function in a hearing world.''Students noted that Mrs. Spilman does not know sign language and cannot communicate with the deaf.This afternoon, after the administration decided not to hold classes, Mrs. Spilman spoke to more than 1,000 students in the university's field house. She reiterated her support for Dr. Zinser and declared that the decision was final and that the other demands had been rejected by the board.Students had given the board a list of demands that included, in addition to the appointment of a deaf president, that a majority of the trustees be deaf people, that Mrs. Spilman resign, and that there be no retribution for students or faculty participating in the protest. Appeal to Congress''Yesterday, the board selected a new president,'' Mrs. Spilman said, reading from a prepared statement to a chorus of foot stomping, shouting students. ''The process was lawful, proper and final.''With that, nearly all of the students, visibly agitated by Mrs. Spilman's statement, stormed out of the meeting and marched to the Capitol to solicit Congressional support. The cause for a deaf president has had strong support in Congress.''She won't listen to us and if we can't have a deaf president, we won't listen to her,'' Kim Harris, an undergraduate student, said in sign language.Although the Senate was in recess and the House was not in session, Michael O'Donnell, assistant manager of telecommunications for the deaf in the Senate's seargent-at-arms office, spoke with students and agreed to deliver their concerns to Congressional representatives. 'We Won't Give Up'Gary Olson, executive director for the National Association of the Deaf, which had sought for months to persuade the board to appoint a deaf president, was among the demonstrators.''We won't give up until we win,'' Mr. Olson told the protesters as they left the Capitol this afternoon.The students marched down Pennsylvania Avenue to Lafayette Park across from the White House as a police escort protected them from rush-hour traffic. The police said there were no arrests and described the protesters as orderly. After a series of speeches, student leaders said they would return to the campus to plan more protests.The liberal arts college, which was founded in 1856, is federally chartered and received $61 million from Congress this year, has an enrollment of 2,200 college students, 10 percent of whom are foreign students."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/07/us/new-president-protested-at-school-for-deaf.html", "headline": "New President Protested at School for Deaf", "date": "1988-03-07T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 7, 1988, Section A, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Zinser, vice chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, to be the president.''Neither of the other two candidates had the breadth of her experience,'' said the board of trustees' chairwoman, Jane Bassett Spilman, of the 10 to 4 vote for Ms. Zinser.Ms. Zinser, who is not deaf, said it was important for her now to develop skills to communicate with the deaf community.Hundreds of students who had wanted a deaf appointee immediately took to the streets in protest, marching two dozen blocks from the university to the Mayflower Hotel, where the meeting was held, the police said.Earlier, throngs of students, faculty members and alumni gathered at the school's gates and waved signs urging ''Deaf President Now.''

But an experimental device developed by four mechanical engineering students at Stanford University offers hope of enabling the deaf-blind to receive messages and even read on their own.Today such people - including almost 15,000 Americans - can communicate only through hand-to-hand fingerspelling in which there are hand and finger configurations for each letter of the alphabet. This method, though, ''allows interaction only with others who are both knowledgeable in sign language and willing to participate in hands-on-hands communication, which is both restrictive and fatiguing,'' said a report in Soma, a publication of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.The report describes a sophisticated mechanical hand called Dexter that is programmed by computer to finger-spell. A phone link to other computers can let the user receive messages, probably even read. It is not the first mechanical hand developed for finger spelling, but it is by far the most advanced. A finger-spelling glove is also being developed to allow the deaf-blind to send messages via computer.The authors of the report are Deborah Gilden of the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Foundation in San Francisco, and David L. Jaffe of the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Medical Center's Rehabilitation Research and Development Center.They said the device still has trouble signaling the letters J and Z. It also needs improvement in signaling the transition from one letter to the next. But it already has some important advantages over previous devices: Its uniform signals are helpful for people who are trying learn the language, and it never gets tired.Dexter looks like a large robot hand projecting out of a box. It has four jointed aluminum fingers and a thumb capable of motions comparable to those of human fingers. It is powered by compressed air through electrically controlled valves that function at the command of a microcomputer. A sighted person can signal with Dexter by using a typewriter keyboard. The hand can now produce about two letters per second, starting from and returning to a partly flexed neutral position.Dexter was designed by John Danssaert, Alan Greenstein, Patricia Lee and Alex Meade of Stanford in a class project sponsored by the Smith-Kettlewell Foundation."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/26/nyregion/social-worker-took-children-of-deaf-woman.html", "headline": "Social Worker Took Children of Deaf Woman", "date": "1987-11-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 26, 1987, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Lack of Consent FormAn attorney for the city, Ronald Younkins, said the social worker who visited the family Nov. 5 at a private shelter for battered women in Brooklyn did not have a consent form that would have allowed the mother to agree to foster care, but that the children were removed that same day anyway.A spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services, Suzanne Trazoff, declined to comment on the case or how the children might have been taken without proper authorization.According to an affidavit filed by Lauren Farber, executive director of the Center for the Elimination of Violence in the Family, which operates the shelter, social service workers came to the shelter in response to reports from officials there that the mother was having trouble caring for the children.Once the social workers arrived, however, they ''made no attempt to explain to her what was happening,'' Ms. Farber said, referring to the mother. 'Maybe She Didn't Understand'Under state law, New York City's Department of Social Services may place a child in temporary foster care if a parent consents in writing or if a Family Court judge authorizes the removal.''Maybe she didn't understand,'' Mr. Younkins said, referring to the mother, who was identified only as Frances F. ''As soon as we understood that she wanted them back, we immediately acted.''According to court papers, the children were to be taken temporarily until a ''homemaking'' helper could be assigned from the Department of Social Services to help the mother care for the children while she is in the shelter. In a signed affidavit, however, the mother said simply that nothing was ever explained to her.''I never signed permission for them to be taken,'' she said. ''I believed they were being taken to school.'' When they did not return in the evening, I became very upset and I have been very upset ever since.''The court order, signed by Acting Justice Elliott Wilk of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said the city had to return the children by 3 P.M. yesterday and that the promised ''homemaking'' help had to be at the shelter by 9 A.M. this morning. Mr. Younkins, an attorney of the office of the Corporation Counsel, said the city would adhere to the order."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/14/nyregion/articulate-friend-of-deaf-is-recalled.html", "headline": "Articulate Friend of Deaf Is Recalled", "date": "1987-09-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from September 14, 1987, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

''She acted as a speaker, a P.R. person, a guidance counselor and also a jill-of-all-trades.''Mrs. Nash, a spirited woman who was 4 feet 10 inches tall, was born in the Ukraine and immigrated to Brooklyn as a child. She learned sign language and went to work for the society in the late 1920's, when her husband, Rabbi A. Felix Nash, became its director. After his death in 1932, she took over for him. Court Appearances as InterpreterUnder her leadership, the agency helped find jobs and housing for scores of deaf people, and she worked as an interpreter for deaf people in state mental hospitals and psychiatrists' offices.Lester J. Waldman, another society board member and a longtime friend of Mrs. Nash, remembered her appearances in Federal court as an interpreter for deaf immigrants hoping to become United States citizens.''One of the favorite questions was who was the third President of the United States, and you had to answer correctly to pass,'' Mr. Waldman said. ''And no matter what the deaf person signed out, her answer was always, 'Jefferson!,' and the judge banged down his gavel and said, 'Admitted.' ''Mr. Waldman also recalled Mrs. Nash's remark to Helen Keller after the famous woman, who was an acquaintance, had to have a toe amputated.''Tanya said, 'Tell Helen Keller we're all glad that they removed a toe and not a finger on one of her hands,' '' Mr. Waldman said. '' 'Because if they had, she would have spoken with a speech defect for the rest of her life.' ''Mrs. Nash's niece, Julia Mallach, spoke of her aunt as a ''funny, eccentric, generous, stubborn and always loving lady'' and recalled ''the time she threw her purse in the incinerator and took the trash to work.''''I'm sure we'll all be telling Tanya stories for years to come,'' she said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/15/obituaries/tanya-z-nash-89-a-carrer-dedicated-to-helping-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Tanya Z Nash, 89; A Carrer Dedicated to Helping the Deaf", "date": "1987-07-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 15, 1987, Section B, Page 6Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.The society in 1974 dedicated its new community residence on East 13th Street in honor of Mrs. Nash and her long service to the deaf. The residence was named Tanya Towers. The 132-unit high-rise building near Avenue B is a home for the elderly, about half of whom are deaf.Born in the Ukraine, Mrs. Nash immigrated to Brooklyn as a child. She became involved with the Society for the Welfare of the Jewish Deaf in 1929 when her husband, Rabbi A. Felix Nash, became its director.Mrs. Nash was a social worker and Rabbi Nash was equally involved in that field. They learned sign language from deaf people at the society. Humble OriginsMrs. Nash worked for many years as an interpreter for deaf people at religious services on Ellis Island as well as for deaf patients in state mental hospitals and psychiatrists' offices.In 1932, after Rabbi Nash's death, Mrs. Nash was asked to take over leadership of the society in a caretaker role, but she soon was appointed executive director. Under her stewardship, the society provided a social setting for deaf people and helped them in such practical matters as finding jobs.The society, founded in 1911, changed its name to the Jewish Society for the Deaf in 1951. It assumed its present, nonsectarian identity 15 years later.At the opening Tanya Towers, Mrs. Nash spoke of the poverty her relatives faced when they arrived in this country in 1904. She recalled that when she won a citywide spelling contest at the age of 13, she was unable to attend the award ceremony because her shoes were in tatters.Mrs. Nash is survived by her sister, Ruth Schreiber, and a niece, Julia Mallach, both of Manhattan.A memorial service will be held at a date to be announced."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/08/nyregion/a-deaf-dance-student-takes-a-leading-role.html", "headline": "A DEAF DANCE STUDENT TAKES A LEADING ROLE", "date": "1987-06-08T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 8, 1987, Section B, Page 4Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Portraying humans and fairies, squirrels, bees and plants, they were two days away from performing in the National Dance Institute's Event of the Year, and it was a nervous time - their first rehearsal on the big stage.Scrambling into line with the other children was one girl, Natasha Honore, who had had to work a little harder than most to get there.Cast in the lead female role as the Queen Mother, Natasha is an exuberant 13-year-old from Brooklyn who likes playing the piano and skating, and who is deaf and partially blind.Every year since 1976, Jacques D'Amboise, the dance institute's founder and director, has introduced dance to scores of New York City public school children through his classes and his Event of the Year. This year's program, ''A Celtic Tale,'' features 1,000 children, a handful of parents, and a group of New York City police officers. It will be presented at 8 P.M. tonight at the Felt Forum. A Step Toward Her DreamFor Natasha, a student at Junior High School 47, a school for the deaf on the East Side of Manhattan, the show is a way to challenge herself and a step toward her dream of becoming a professional dancer, a dream she has had since she was 3.Wearing a long yellow shirt over pink pants dotted with pictures of tiny people, braces flashing as she smiled, Natasha said through sign language and an interpreter that she wanted to be ''either a jazz, ballet or tap dancer - maybe all three.''In her role as Queen Mother, her baby is stolen from her by wicked fairies on a quest for a perfect human child. The role requires both acting and dancing, and Natasha is on stage for a good part of the show.Dancing along with the music is difficult but not impossible, Natasha said, because with a hearing aid she can feel its vibrations and beat. ''Sometimes I fall a little behind,'' she said, ''but I really try to connect with the music.''''I could not believe with all the learning challenges facing Natasha that she's as accomplished as she is,'' said Mr. D'Amboise, who met Natasha last fall when she was brought to one of his dance classes, held throughout the year at public schools around the city.Twenty of Natasha's classmates are also in the show, cast as sprigs of holly, after having shared dance classes for a year with five hearing children from Public School 40. Their teacher is Adrienne Ehrlich, who is also the founder and director of the Light Waves Dance Theatre, a dance company for the deaf. Natasha is that company's youngest performer.Speaking of Natasha's classmates at J.H.S. 47, Ms. Ehrlich said that ''for most of them, it's the first time they ever danced, and the demands are a lot.'' She said she asks a great deal from her students.''People immediately have lower expectations of deaf people,'' she added ''for absolutely no reason whatsoever. I work them even harder, just to compensate.''During the performance, the P.S. 40 students are helping those students who cannot hear the music by watching them closely and providing visual cues. They said the deaf students have taught them the basics of sign language and helped them discover, in the words of Ms. Ehrlich, that ''deaf people are exactly the same, only without hearing.''Back on stage, Mr. D'Amboise was directing a group of children portraying Fairy Thieves, shepherding them into line as he clapped in time to the music. The police officers, who play the king's bodyguards, lumbered in, twirling gamely and making graceful gesticulations with their hands.''Well done! Well done!'' Mr. D'Amboise said. It was time for Natasha's entrance, and on she ran, giggling with her friends, and began to dance."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/18/nyregion/guard-at-li-school-for-deaf-is-found-dead-after-beating.html", "headline": "Guard at L.I.

She has been deaf since birth.Kathy has studied with speech therapists all her life, but lately she has begun to work with a combination of electronic tools that some experts believe will revolutionize the way deaf students learn to speak.She is enrolled in the Model Secondary School for the Deaf at Gallaudet University, where teachers are using computer technology originally developed for musicians to help deaf students practice their vocal skills. Using a personal computer, a synthesizer and new software, Kathy can ''see'' her voice.''I want to learn more words, and now I enjoy learning them,'' Kathy said in labored but recognizable speech.Teachers caution that their program only began six months ago, but they say it has captured students' attention and has given them a new and powerful tool for communicating.Teachers record phrases and sentences. The synthesizer uses a computer to store and recreate them with remarkable precision. Stroke of Key Recreates SoundThe student or teacher can then retrieve the stored sound by hitting a particular key on the synthesizer's keyboard. Kathy, with Maureen Nichols, a speech therapist at the school, recently played back a sentence - ''I will order the pizza'' - over and over again, each time with slightly different intonation until Kathy could mimic it.Teachers also turn to the computer for students whose hearing is even more limited than Kathy's. Using a software program created to allow musicians to produce highly precise sounds, the computer creates a visual display whose peaks and valleys represent different sounds.''When they look at the computer screen, they see a representation of sound that is as close as they have ever come to actually hearing it,'' said Howard Schlieper, an audio engineer at the Model School. ''It's not the same as hearing, but these students are perceiving sound in ways that they can use.''The computer displays wave forms for sounds in either two or three dimensions, presenting the sound in terms of its frequency and amplitude and measured over time. The computer operator can then pinpoint a particular part of the word - the high frequency ''z'' sound in ''pizza,'' for instance - and let the student practice it. Debate Over Teaching SpeechAlthough educators agree that computer technology is likely to become an ever-greater part of teaching deaf people to speak, not everyone is convinced that speech should be at the center of education for the deaf, and some experts condemn the use of computer in the curriculum.Arden Neisser, author of ''The Other Side of Silence'', a 1983 book on education for the deaf, said electronic systems for teaching speech are ''great grant-winners,'' but, she added, ''I don't have a lot of confidence in them.'' Ms. Neisser and many other experts on education for the deaf favor curriculums that emphasize sign language over teaching speech.About 17 million Americans are estimated to have notable hearing loss; 2 million of them have severe hearing loss. Less than 10 percent of them ever learn to speak well enough to rely on it to the exclusion of sign language, Ms. Neisser said. Because deaf students so often are unable to learn to communicate effectively through speech, Ms. Neisser said educational techniques that focus on speech often rob time from other skills that could be more important for the students to learn.Teachers at the Model School acknowledge the ''oral-manual controversy'' but they say their program tries to give students the tools they need to communicate with anyone, deaf or hearing. They contend that teaching sign language exclusively limits deaf people from communicating with the vast majority of people who hear.Teaching the deaf to speak has often meant years of laborious, frustrating work. Deaf students work with therapists to break the complex sounds of words into small, more easily mastered pieces. Students build up their speech slowly, concentrating on each of the component parts of words before joining them together in recognizable speech.But educators at the Model School say the novelty of working with a computer holds students' attention, and some of the software package's features make it possible for students to see how their words sound.Students can use computer terminals to display visual representations of phrases they pronounce along with those of the same phrase spoken by their teachers.Ms. Nichols said the computer holds out most promise for certain areas of speech therapy, such as distinguishing between syllables and identifying stresses in words, that are most easily represented by the computer's graphics.One Model School student, for instance, recorded the word ''Calico,'' her cat's name. She had been having trouble recognizing that the stress fell on the word's first syllable, but the computer, which displays each syllable as a distinct sound ''event,'' isolated the first syllable and showed her where to place the stress. Words as PicturesWhen she first tried to pronounce the word ''Callico,'' the student said ''Cacco,'' omitting the middle syllable. But with the help of the computer, she was able to see that she had left out a sound, and a speech therapist helped her turn the picture into the word.Other students have taken their computer work even further. One student who had studied mathematical and theoretical aspects of composition used the computer and the synthesizer to write music. Another group of students produced an educational video called ''Don't Drive Drunk.'' Deaf students filmed the video, narrated it and scored the sound track.The computer software that the school uses is produced by Digidesign, a company in Palo Alto, Calif. A spokesman for the company said the firm never envisioned that the program would be use to teach the deaf.''We're delighted, of course,'' said Rob Manning, a product specialist at Digidesign. ''But we're really a music software company, so this is something of a surprise.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/15/style/the-family-children-of-deaf-share-their-lives.html", "headline": "CHILDREN OF DEAF SHARE THEIR LIVES", "date": "1986-12-15T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 15, 1986, Section C, Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them.Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.''I say to my brother now, 'Why couldn't we ever talk about these things?' '' said 22-year old Annjoy Marcus. ''It's been such an important part of our lives.''''It's hard to explain, but it was something you just didn't ever discuss,'' said her 26-year-old brother, Alan. ''It's so liberating, now, to be able to deal with this.''What they were discussing - in words and in the graceful pantomime of sign language - was the experience of growing up as the hearing children of deaf parents. They shared that experience last week with other adult children of the deaf at a conference that marked the latest public expression of a movement that is focusing new attention on deafness in the family.No statistics exist on the number of Americans with family members who are hearing-impaired, but their numbers are believed to be large. Census studies cited at the conference estimate that 2 million people in the United States are profoundly deaf and that more than 18 million Americans have some hearing impairment. Other studies suggest that 90 percent of children born to deaf adults can hear normally.The meeting at Marymount Manhattan College in New York, the first of its kind on the East Coast, offered insights about both the benefits and the burdens of growing up in the families of the deaf. The gathering was the most recent evidence of a trend toward increasing communication between the deaf, their parents and children, and the educators and practitioners who work with them.The 100 participants included the hearing-impaired, their family members and experts in the field. Marked occasionally by tears and often by laughter, the daylong meeting offered simultaneous translation for both the deaf and the hearing.''It's only during the last two years or so that children of deaf adults 'came out' in any numbers,'' said Nancy Frishberg, a linguist at I.B.M. who has conducted research on sign language. Dr. Frishberg cited the influence of dramatic portrayals of deaf people and their families, such as the movie version of ''Children of a Lesser God'' and the Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of ''Love Is Never Silent.''However, Dr. Frishberg and others at the meeting said the primary impetus for the new focus on families of the deaf was the work of an education and advocacy organization, the Children of Deaf Adults (CODA), a sponsor of the conference. The group, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., has attracted 500 members since its founding in 1983, and now has five chapters around the country.Many hearing children of deaf parents said at the meeting that sharing insights about the culture of the deaf had enabled them to appreciate an experience they had undervalued. ''It is a culture that some try to reject as adults,'' said Mike Jacobs, president of an executive search firm in Manhattan. ''But now many are realizing that it's an experience that gives us so much in common - well, it just takes your breath away.''As a young child, Mr. Jacobs began signing to his deaf parents during radio broadcasts. When he was 5, he said, ''family legend has it that one night, while I was interpreting what was on the air, I turned to the radio and said, 'Wait a minute!' ''He added, ''We children of deaf parents share many stories of assuming early responsibility.''Mr. Jacobs stressed that this had its positive aspects, and Mr. Marcus agreed that it could foster maturity and independence. ''But I also feel that I had no childhood,'' Mr. Marcus said. A Need for Research''We need much more research into the roles we take,'' said Lou Ann Walker, the author of ''A Loss for Words,'' her memoir of living in a family with deaf parents. Some at the conference said the book, published last fall, was the catalyst for re-examining their own childhoods.One of the roles Ms. Walker referred to was that of mediator between parents and society, a role she likened to that of children of immigrants who do not speak English. ''Sometimes we were annoyed by all the questions,'' she said. ''Can your parents talk, can they drive a car, can they work? Of course they could! But people felt that somehow if your parents couldn't hear, they were totally disabled.''Society's insensitivity toward the deaf was often infuriating, Mr. Marcus said. ''The other kids would ask about my grandmother, 'Oh, is she the lady that's deaf and dumb?' '' he said. ''And I'd get angry and explain that the word 'dumb' means stupid, and that my grandmother wasn't.''He added: ''Dealing with my parents' deafness wasn't the problem. The problem was dealing with the world's perception of their deafness.''The conference was also sponsored by Gallaudet University in Washington, a 180-year-old school for the deaf, and Marymount Manhattan College, which offers the only certified undergraduate program for educators of the deaf in New York State. The address of Children of Deaf Adults is P.O. Box 30715, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93130.A 19-year-old Marymount sophomore at the conference, Marcella Mitchell, said she had learned signing from a cousin. ''A lot of people look at the hearing-impaired as deaf people, instead of people who just happen to be deaf,'' said Ms. Mitchell. ''I wish people could just look at them as human beings.''At the conference, some adult children of the deaf movingly described evidence of their parents' love. ''My parents slept every night with their hands reaching through the railings of the crib so they would know when I was crying or moving,'' said Mary Ann Klein of the New York Society for the Deaf.''Being here, it's been fascinating, and it's made me wonder whether my children will suffer some of these effects,'' signed Samuel Landau of Manhattan. He and his wife, Rachelle, who is also deaf, have three children, aged 7, 5 and 1, all of whom can hear. ''I think it's so necessary for us to be talking about these things,'' he said.''I don't feel guilty, though, that I've involved my kids in the deaf culture,'' said Howard R. Busby, a professor and administrator at Gallaudet University. He is the father of four hearing children, aged 6 to 26. ''I think it's been a very positive experience for them.''In fact, many of the deaf participants took delight in sharing the humor they sometimes find at the junction of the hearing and nonhearing worlds. One of the more amusing moments came when Dr. Busby described the antics of his 6-year-old. ''He's very proud of showing off my deafness to his schoolmates,'' he signed. ''To prove I'm deaf he stands behind me and yells - and I don't respond, to his great delight.''''But one day when he was trying this, by chance I did happen to look around while he was yelling. You know, I think he's still wondering whether I'm a faker or not!''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/obituaries/mack-scism-director-at-theater-of-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Mack Scism, Director At Theater of the Deaf", "date": "1986-11-06T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 6, 1986, Section B, Page 18Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

It will begin to air on network television tomorrow.Roy T. Bergold, vice president, advertising, in the company of Beth Ann Bull, one of the spot's stars, and several other interested parties showed up for a screening at Carl Byoir & Associates, the public relations firm, Monday morning.The 30-second commercial itself is about an engaging couple of college students who, at the urging of the young man and despite the fact that it is exam week, decide to go to McDonald's and get some takeout for a picnic on the beach. The dialogue is conducted in sign language against a background of a fairly muted musical score.Strangely, there are also printed subtitles as if the hearing impaired were being given an option on which way to receive the message. That is not the case, Mr. Bergold said. It is just that regular hearing viewers get confused by the signs, don't get enough selling symbolism from the golden arches and need to be kept abreast of what is going on.The agency is the Leo Burnett Company of Chicago.The commercial will run as one of a pool of more than 150 different commercials that will be supported by well over $300 million in advertising spending this year by both the corporation and its co-op associations of franchises.May is National Better Hearing and Speech month.Miss Bull is 21 years old and is from San Gabriel, Calif. Her co-star is Andrew Rubin, 17, of Tuckahoe, N.Y. She is a student at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester.There has been a growing movement toward reaching the nation's approximately 22 million hearing impaired people with close-captioned commercials and programs. A leader in this effort is the National Captioning Institute, which has reported that there are 280 advertisers that so caption their commercials, as do some 70 hours of programming a week. This organization also helped McDonald's research the commercial's acceptance among the hearing impaired.Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0Feb. 4, 2022, 1:43 p.m. ETHere\u2019s what you need to know about the January jobs report.Architects at a prominent New York firm drop their unionization bid.Hertz hires a former Goldman Sachs finance chief as its C.E.O.McDonald's, Mr. Bergold said, is interested in getting its message specifically to as many types of consumers as possible. That's why there is advertising designed especially for the black consumer, others for the Hispanic consumer and, more recently, for the handicapped consumer.As for the handicapped, Mr. Bergold explained, the company has been doing special spots with them in mind since 1980. But in the past McDonald's and its agency took the easy way out by simply recognizing the fact that there are handicapped people by showing people in wheelchairs among the hordes of customers.Meanwhile, the advertising for the black market is done by Burrell Advertising in Chicago and the Spanish-language advertising by Conill Advertising in New York. The latter's output generally runs on the Spanish International Network.Burnett became the national agency for McDonald's in 1984 and for a while used the ''You deserve a break today'' theme developed by its predecesor, Needham, Harper & Steers. It replaced it briefly with ''Together, McDonald's and you,'' and then, seeking to get across a good-taste story, introduced the current ''It's a good time for the great taste of McDonald's.''McDonald's is not only the world's largest fast-food chain, but it was also the most advertised single brand name in America last year, according to Marketing and Media Decisions Magazine.The advertising it gets, like those of auto and soft drink companies, comes not only from the headquarters, but also groups of franchisees (or dealers or bottlers) and also individual restaurants.All can advertise. As a matter of fact, the groups or co-ops have joined together specifically to advertise. Usually they have their own agencies including some big ones like Lawrence, Charles, Free & Lawson, which generally make ads for special groupwide promotions. Otherwise the groups use the commercials from Burnett."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/09/arts/love-is-never-silent-on-deafness-in-a-family.html", "headline": "'LOVE IS NEVER SILENT,' ON DEAFNESS IN A FAMILY", "date": "1985-12-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 9, 1985, Section C, Page 21Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

We get all this in ''Love Is Never Silent'' on NBC at 9 P.M. tonight.To be sure, ''family entertainment'' has a slightly pejorative connotation. We think of sentiment and uplift. Actually, there's nothing wrong with either of these qualities, and they're present in the production tonight. The sentiment, however, isn't saccharine, and the uplift isn't cloying. ''Love is Never Silent'' is tough-minded.The production, based on Joanne Greenberg's novel, ''In This Sign,'' is the story of a young woman (played by Mare Winningham) and her deaf parents (Phyllis Frelich and Ed Waterstreet). The story begins in 1931. There are hard times. We get a tenement neighborhood, the details faithfully recreated. At the same time, much of this is filmed in a soft, golden haze. ''Love is Never Silent'' is an extremely good-looking production.Miss Winningham is her family's bridge to the speaking world. Miss Frelich and Mr. Waterstreet, both members of the National Theater of the Deaf, live in a world of silence. Their daughter - we see her first at the age of 10, when she is played by Susan Ann Curtis - must even arrange the funeral of her younger brother. She is burdened, and her feelings of guilt, shame, love and duty are in collision.Miss Winningham, a fetching actress, uses sign language to communicate with Miss Frelich and Mr. Waterstreet. She speaks the lines aloud as well. With the help of Joseph Sargent, the director, she creates a touching character: a young woman torn between her own needs and those of her parents. ''Why can't you understand that - I'm not different,'' she shouts at Miss Frelich. But she is different, of course; her family ensures that.Thus sacrifices are made. Costs are extracted. For much of the production, Miss Winningham has only Sid Caesar to rely on. Mr. Caesar plays the owner of a pawn shop, supposedly a Greek immigrant. It's nice to see Mr. Caesar on television again, although he does speak in bromides. ''People laugh at me because I talk different,'' he tells Miss Winningham, and ''Where is your life - your happiness?'' Nothing about this seems Greek, incidentally, except that Mr. Caesar wears a fisherman's cap and at one point mentions ouzo.Meanwhile, Miss Winningham grows up. It is World War II. She meets a nice young man (Fredric Lehne) who, before he goes overseas, proposes marriage. Miss Winningham is reluctant. She says there are things about her he doesn't know. He implores; she finally confesses. Her parents, she says, are deaf.''Is that it? Is that all?'' he says incredulously. Actually, he's touching on a weakness in ''Love Is Never Silent.'' As touching as much of it is, the family problems do grow a little tiresome. We're hoping Miss Winningham will clear out and lead her own life long before she does. Part of the problem here is that Miss Frelich, who proved in ''Children of a Lesser God'' on Broadway that she is an extremely versatile actress, is giving us a sullen and suspicious mother. She has a wonderfully exuberant scene toward the end, but it's an awfully long time coming.Still, it is a handsome production - the executive producer is Marian Rees - and it also gives us Cloris Leachman, seen in the small part of Mr. Lehne's mother. Watch Miss Leachman, using one of her agonized smiles, take a dinner-table scene and steal it. ''Love Is Never Silent'' is intelligent and sometimes moving, but it doesn't quite touch us the way it should."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/27/arts/tv-reviews-film-about-an-ape-who-knows-sign-language.html", "headline": "  FILM ABOUT AN APE WHO KNOWS SIGN LANGUAGE", "date": "1985-03-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 27, 1985, Section C, Page 26Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

It's all about this boy and an orangutan named Casey. Young - very young - audiences should be delighted.Casey has been raised by a scientist named Dolly McKeever and has learned a system of sign language. Following a highway accident, Casey wanders off from the wreckage and ends up prowling around the rural home of the Wyler family. The orangutan is spotted by young Toby Wyler, who has been left deaf and mute by meningitis and who is played nicely by Sean Gerlis, himself deaf from birth. A large chunk of the movie is taken up with Toby's efforts to persuade his mother (Tess Harper) and new stepfather (James Farentino) that he has really seen the animal wandering around the house. Casey's disappearance has not been publicized because Dr. McKeever is afraid of triggering public panic.With his feisty kid sister (Bridgette Andersen) as his single, unwavering ally, Toby copes with everybody from his dubious and seemingly impenetrable parents to the nasty owner (Burt Young) of a sleazy circus that just happens to be traveling through town. Among the gimmicks worked into the plot is the theme from ''Sesame Street,'' which turns out to be one of Casey's favorite songs. Eventually, using sign language, Toby saves Casey from a trigger-happy searching posse, and the final scene features a generous quota of lovingly tear-filled eyes. More irascible viewers may moan a bit, but the kids are likely to cheer. Scott Swanton's teleplay was directed by Robert Lewis. The producers are Micheline H. Keller and Edward Gold.For grownups seeking, presumably, more elevated fare, tonight's telecast of ''Live From the Met,'' beginning on WNET/13 at 8, is offering the new production of Puccini's ''Tosca'' that has been designed and directed by the always flamboyant Franco Zeffirelli. Depending perhaps on one's mood, the sheer sumptuousness of Mr. Zeffirelli's methods can be either awesome or infuriating. Certainly, the incredible lavishness of the sets in this production is not likely to be forgotten soon.In an intermission film feature, Mr. Zeffirelli, accompanied by a young man who appears determined to jot down his every word, wanders through some of Rome's architectural glories, observing how everything is larger than life and how he wants to bring this quality to his interpretation of the opera. For him, Tosca is Rome. Their grandeur, he declares, ''makes you feel so small'' and ''realize how little you can accomplish today.'' He describes his working process as ''an accumulation of correct things which makes a production respectable.''One problem with Mr. Zeffirelli's passion for bigness is that the sets are evidently cumbersome and the intermissions are unusually long as the removals and installations proceed. But the overall theatrical effects should work handsomely on television. At a performance last week, used as a run- through for this broadcast, the sets and costumes looked quite spectacular on a small black-and-white monitor used on one of the cameras. In addition, Placido Domingo's Cavaradossi adds up to one of the best performances of this distinguished tenor's career. Hildegard Behrens is Tosca and Cornell MacNeil is Scarpia. The conductor is Giuseppe Sinopoli.The television host will be Joanne Woodward, and the program will be simulcast in stereo over WQXR-FM."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/14/garden/telephone-for-the-deaf-uses-television-images.html", "headline": "TELEPHONE FOR THE DEAF USES TELEVISION IMAGES", "date": "1985-03-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 14, 1985, Section C, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Television images of the speaker are to be transmitted through telephone lines and displayed on a screen at the receiving end. The device would have cameras and screens at both ends for two-way communication.When Bell invented the telephone in 1876, he was seeking a way for his wife, who was deaf, to communicate. His device revolutionized communications but was no help for her.''At present,'' said Mr. Nadler, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science, ''deaf people converse with one another using a teletype. It's not very personal. Facial expression, eye and lip motion are very important in sign language. But the only way the deaf can communicate that now is in person.''Professor Nadler, whose 34-year- old daughter, Maia, is legally deaf, has $440,000 in grants from the National Science Foundation and the state of Virginia to build and test his telephone during the next two years.Gallaudet College in Washington, the national college for the deaf plans to test his first model next year. ''We regard this device as having considerable potential importance,'' said Raymond Trybus, dean of graduate studies and research at Gallaudet.Professor Nadler said he had problems designing the phone because an image of photographic quality contains too much detail to be sent quickly through telephone lines, but computer simplification of the images and a new A.T. & T. transmitting system with larger capacity solved the problems.Mr. Nadler said he began working on his telephone at his daughter's request while he was living in France. He got a $75,000 grant from a French agency for a feasibility study and worked with a French institute for the deaf on the project."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/10/business/technology-phone-device-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Technology;   Phone Device For the Deaf", "date": "1985-01-10T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 10, 1985, Section D, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

And, unlike an artificial ear recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the device does not try to give a handicapped person a sense of hearing.What the mechanism does, rather, is to convert tones generated by a Touch-Tone telephone to letters that a hearing-impaired person can see.If someone wants to ''talk'' by telephone with a hearing-impaired person who owns the new device, the caller sends his message by pressing his push- button phone's keys. Thus the keypad is used like a typewriter keyboard. On the receiving end, the varying tones are translated electronically into characters that flow across the device's liquid- crystal display screen. Instead of hearing his caller, the hearing-impaired person sees the caller's words in ticker-tape fashion.''The significiant idea is that the world is getting full of Touch-Tone phones,'' said Edwin C. Underkoffler, the G.E. computer scientist who invented the device to help a colleague communicate with his deaf son. ''This enables people who might otherwise be unable to telephone the deaf or hearing-impaired to do so.''For more than two decades, deaf people and others with severe hearing ailments have been able to communicate over telephone lines. In general, however, there have been drawbacks to the available methods.Users have relied mainly on a Teletype system called Telephone Devices for the Deaf. To make a call, someone with such a device would type out a message, which would go via phone line to another person's Teletype.But this requires both the caller and the individual being called to own a Teletype, which is a bulky and often costly machine. And in the few large cities with so-called relay stations - centers where a volunteer sitting at a Teletype relays a caller's message to a handicapped person's machine - users have complained that intimate conversations through a go-between are difficult.The new, pocket-size device is aimed at overcoming such problems. General Electric has licensed the device for manufacture to Palmetto Technologies Inc., a small engineering concern in Duncan, S.C., outside Greenville. Stephen L. Fowler, the founder of Palmetto Technologies, says that all a caller needs to use the system is a Touch-Tone phone. The system, called the Echo 2,000, is priced at $250.''The Teletype method demands that a person with no handicap spend a considerable sum of money to talk with a person who is deaf,'' said Mr. Fowler, an electrical engineer whose mother is deaf. ''That's unreasonable. This device puts the responsibility on the deaf person to overcome his handicap.''Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0Feb. 4, 2022, 1:43 p.m. ETHere\u2019s what you need to know about the January jobs report.Architects at a prominent New York firm drop their unionization bid.Hertz hires a former Goldman Sachs finance chief as its C.E.O.The technology is much like that used by banks and brokerage firms to let customers get account information by using push-button phones. In that case also, tones are changed into signals a computer can understand.Many banking applications pose a problem for hearing-impaired people, however, because replies to their Touch-Tone queries are usually audible (in the form of a computer-generated synthesized voice) rather than visual. A Veterans Administration office in California is exploring ways to use the new unit to help the hard of hearing. Banks' computers, for example, might generate tones that would be converted to account balance numbers that could be read.The G.E. invention relies on a coding system to change tones into letters. To ''talk,'' a caller depresses two telephone keys for each letter. The first key is the one on which the letter is located; the second is the 1, 2 or 3 key to indicate the position of the letter on the first key pressed.To transmit ''P,'' for example, the caller would press the 7 key (on which the letters PRS also appear) and then the 1 key. The information then flows over the phone line to the Echo 2,000's tiny screen, which can display 16 characters. A microprocessor inside the device with 2 kilobytes of memory can store an additional 800 characters. A little more than half of its memory is devoted to internal programs, such as the operating system, that regulate the Echo 2,000.The device, which a hearing-impaired person attaches directly to his phone, is not without its problems. Learning the code could be difficult for some persons. And Mr. Fowler concedes that his device, which can transmit only about 30 words a minute, is slower than Teletypes.For these reasons, organizations representing the deaf are not convinced that the Echo 2,000 is a panacea.''The typing is very, very slow,'' said Joel D. Ziev, an executive at the New York Society for the Deaf, who has studied the new machine. ''We're interested, but we'd like to know more before we pass judgment.''''It might be an advance for short conversations or in areas where there aren't relay centers,'' said Clifford R. Rowley, president of New York/New Jersey Phone-TTY Inc., a service group providing communications devices for the deaf. ''My impression is that it might be O.K. for a percentage of the deaf population but not for the majority.''Still, Mr. Fowler hopes his device will succeed. To compensate for its drawbacks, he has installed fast-forward and reverse features so that users can review what has been said. And he has programmed the device so that callers need punch only two keys to transmit common words such as ''yes,'' ''no,'' ''hello'' and ''goodbye.'' But callers would have to memorize these shortcuts.With $51,000 invested in his venture, Mr. Fowler has sold about 100 Echo 2,000's and has not yet made a profit. But that may come soon, he said.''So far it has been an expensive hobby,'' he said, ''but it's rapidly becoming a full-time job.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/20/garden/a-santa-for-deaf-youngsters.html", "headline": "A SANTA FOR DEAF YOUNGSTERS", "date": "1984-12-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 20, 1984, Section C, Page 9Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Schiffer, advertising marketing manager of the Salem Mall. The mall, a 110-store shopping center in suburban northwest Dayton, began the program for the hearing-impaired this year. Mr. Schiffer estimated that of the 8,000 children who have thus far visited Santa Claus at the mall, about 250 of them have been hearing- impaired.Mr. Shaffer, 22 years old, admitted that he learned sign language for the wrong reasons: to cheat on tests in high school.Now his ingenuity is being taxed in new ways.''Most of the kids who come up to me who have been to another Santa Claus think I'm the same Santa Claus,'' he said. ''There was one kid that came up, and the only thing I could do was convince him I was the real one. I said that when you go to New York, there are people dressed up just like Santa, ringing bells, but I came down here special.''So far, no deaf child has asked why the Saturday Santa understands sign language when on other occasions Santa did not. ''Santa would probably say, 'One of the elves we have is deaf, and I started talking to him,' '' Mr. Shaffer said.Deaf youngsters asking for toys they see on television do not always know what to call them if the brand name is not printed on the screen or if they cannot read. ''They know what the commercials look like,'' Mr. Shaffer said, and will ask for the toy in generic terms - Army or muscle men, for example.So far, the biggest problem has been Santa's bushy beard, which hides his mouth from visitors who rely on lip reading.The mall's St. Nick said he has seen ''miles and miles'' of children. ''I never believed you could get tired from sitting down all day,'' Mr. Shaffer added. ''I've wanted to say the elves are on strike a few times.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/27/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-rosh-ha-shanah-services-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Rosh ha-Shanah Services For the Deaf", "date": "1984-09-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from September 27, 1984, Section B, Page 3Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

They told her she was a very special student who answered voices that told her she had a very special song to sing.Miss Gregory smiled and ran her right hand up her left arm in small, choppy stops. ''I have upgraded myself,'' she said, voicing the words she had expressed with her hands.Claudia Gregory is deaf. Spinal meningitis caused a loss of hearing when she was 2 years old; with the help of a hearing aid, she can discern background noises. But it is not so important to Miss Gregory that she does not hear professors lecturing and doors closing and typewriters hammering. What is important, she says, is that she listened when a voice told her she had more to give.''I was a key punch operator for 12 years,'' said the 36-year-old Miss Gregory, who graduated from La Guardia yesterday with an associate's degree in psychology. She plans to continue her education at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. 10th Anniversary''I enjoyed it, but I realized I would never get a promotion,'' she said. ''I knew there was a different person I could be, so I decided to go back to school. I chose La Guardia because I wanted my deafness to be treated as a factor, not an obstacle.''La Guardia, in Long Island City, Queens, is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its programs for deaf adults, which since 1975 has given Miss Gregory and many others a college education they otherwise might never have had. The program is the largest academic program for deaf adults in the New York area.This year there are 160 hearing-impaired students among the 16,000 students enrolled at La Guardia, up from 40 students in 1982. School officials expect that rate of growth to continue as children who became deaf as a result of a rubella epidemic of the mid- 1960's - about 11,500 nationwide - reach college age.''It tears at you,'' said Joseph Shenker, president of La Guardia. ''The need is there, the need is growing. But there is no other college in the city that services the deaf in a consolidated program of counselors, support staff, interpreters and course choice.''Four schools nationwide have been targeted for major Federal financing for undergraduate programs for deaf students: the University of California at Northridge, Seattle Community College, the St. Paul Vocational Technical Institute and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. Difficult to FinanceIn addition, two colleges are specifically for the deaf, Gallaudet in Washington and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester. Some schools make provisions on an individual basis for deaf students.La Guardia's program is financed through Federal and state grants and allocations from the school budget. ''Serving deaf students is the single most expensive program, and the hardest to get funding for,'' Mr. Shenker said. ''As a lobbying group, the deaf community is a silent group. They do not speak well in public and they are unable as a population in general to make a vigorous case for their own needs.''On top of that, serving the deaf is not a one-cost item, fix-the-problem issue,'' he continued. ''With wheelchair students, you can build a ramp and widen doorways. For blind students, you put Braille plates on the elevators. But for the deaf student, you need an interpreter in every class, at every event.''The program started informally in 1973 after some La Guardia students who were interns at the Lexington School for the Deaf in Jackson Heights told their college administrators about the need of deaf students for post-secondary education. Learning Where to Begin''It struck a chord, it interested us,'' said Fern Khan, director of community service programs, which oversees the programs for deaf adults. ''But we didn't know what to do or where to begin. So we decided to go to the deaf community to ask what they wanted, what they needed.''The administrators found interest in academic courses like literature and in self-improvement courses like tennis. So they designed a program of credit and noncredit courses, including some just for deaf students and some that would put deaf students with hearing students.They established a specially trained staff of counselors and advisers, a career development office and an organization for deaf-student activities. A course in sign-language was offered for hearing students.And the college, Mrs. Khan said, made a commitment to regard a student's deafness as a consideration, not a handicap. Technical courses, like word processing and office skills, are taught in all-deaf classes, but deaf students can register for any course. Every deaf student is entitled to a sign-language intepreter in class.''To sit among fellow students, both hearing and deaf - that is freedom,'' said Carole Lazorisak, coordinator of programs for deaf adults, who has been deaf since birth.Hearing students and teachers at La Guardia are accustomed to seeing people using sign language. They have learned to speak slowly and distinctly so their lips can be read. Miss Gregory recalled with affection a teacher who trimmed his mustache so she could read his lips more easily.Miss Gregory said she was nervous about leaving La Guardia, about leaving her family in Brooklyn and moving with her 12-year-old daughter, Shea, to attend school in Tennessee. But she said she would return when she has her degree in psychology, and would teach other deaf students.''There is a special person inside everyone,'' she said. ''They just have to look for it and listen to it.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/20/theater/dewhurst-adapts-to-language-of-deaf-theater.html", "headline": "DEWHURST ADAPTS TO LANGUAGE OF DEAF THEATER", "date": "1984-08-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 20, 1984, Section C, Page 19Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The makeshift stage is full of characters in motion, but only one voice is speaking, that of a curly haired young man watching the others from a corner. Otherwise there is silence, save for the noisy splashing of the brook and the droning of a fly.Following the action intently is Colleen Dewhurst, the actress. At the moment, her role is that of director, and when the actors have run through their scenes, they will gather around for her to give them notes on their work. However, in this case her comments will be delivered in sign language by the interpreter sitting at her side.For the actors working with Miss Dewhurst are deaf; they have been acting out their parts in sign language. The actual words of the text are spoken aloud by the curly haired young man and another hearing performer, a young woman.The play they are rehearsing is ''All the Way Home,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama adapted by Tad Mosel from James Agee's novel ''A Death in the Family,'' which also won a Pulitzer Prize. The company is the National Theater of the Deaf, and its choice of Miss Dewhurst to direct this year's program is particularly apt; the actress won a Tony Award for her starring role in the original Broadway production of ''All the Way Home'' 24 years ago.Performed at Olympic FestivalFounded in 1967 as part of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., the National Theater of the Deaf became an independent nonprofit corporation in 1982 and moved to its present home beside the Pattaconk Brook in Chester last year. This summer has marked another milestone in the company's history: It was invited to perform at the International Olympic Arts Festival, where it staged last season's major production, ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces,'' last month.Although the individuals change, each season's company consists of 9 or 10 actors and 2 hearing actors; the current production has required the addition of a third hearing actor to play the little boy. ''All the Way Home'' will open in Denver in September, travel on the West Coast and in the Southwest during the fall, and arrive in the East next winter. A Brooklyn date is planned for February, but New Yorkers have a more immediate opportunity to see the troupe at work; the National Theater of the Deaf is presenting a weeklong ''Storytelling Program,'' ending Aug. 24, with performances of poems, fairytales and fables held in libraries in each borough and in Central Park.The company was founded by David Hays, the artistic director, who brought the idea to the Eugene O'Neill center. ''There were such wonderful actors with so much potential, and I just wanted to start a company of deaf actors and do good work,'' he says.As it does for Miss Dewhurst, ''All the Way Home'' has a special resonance for Mr. Hays as well; he was the scenic designer for the 1960 Broadway production. When he chose the play as this year's undertaking for the National Theater of the Deaf, he had no doubt that he wanted Miss Dewhurst to direct.Miss Dewhurst Resists at First''When he asked me, I said, 'You've got to be crazy!''' Miss Dewhurst reports with a throaty chuckle. ''Having failed so brilliantly in my first directorial effort, I sort of wondered, were we all being fair, bringing Colleen in to direct?''Actually, Miss Dewhurst's 1981 debut as a director was a partial success; her production of ''Ned and Jack'' received good reviews at the Hudson Guild, but when it moved to Broadway it closed after one performance.Mr. Hays was not dissuaded. ''We did this play over 20 years ago, and we've all lived a lot since then,'' he says. ''This is the kind of play we want to do here, and I felt that no one in the world could see more deeply and clearly into the hearts of the characters than Colleen. And that's what we're about, is seeing these perceptions.''To communicate those perceptions to its audiences, the company has developed an unusual synthesis of spoken and signed language. ''Our audience has always been 80 to 90 percent hearing people,'' Mr. Hays explains.For their benefit, the two hearing actors speak all of the parts in a free- flowing narrative that is unexpectedly lucid, despite the fact that the roles are not divided in any structured way. The hearing actor voices both male and female parts, as does the actress, and they often switch roles, depending on the demands of a scene; frequently one speaking actor will voice all the parts in a long portion of text, jumping from one character to another with ease and clarity.'It's Like a New Art Form'''To me it's very exciting, because it's like a new art form,'' says Charles Homet, the 24-year-old actor who does much of the speaking in ''All the Way Home.'' ''It's such a beautiful manner of presentation; it's like seeing another layer. Because of the influence of naturalism on theater, what you get is often very limited. But with sign language, which is heightened here for the stage, it's like you're getting more information, and it becomes more theatrical.''For the first few minutes of the play, hearing audiences tend to watch the actor who is actually talking, but the deaf actors acting out their characters in sign language soon become more compelling, and the spoken voice recedes into a kind of narrative. ''At its most successful, what really happens is that I'm almost invisible,'' Mr. Homet notes.Most of the deaf actors come to the company through the four-week training program offered by the National Theater of the Deaf every summer. Deaf students apply from all over the country, and of the 30 who are accepted for the summer school, one or two are chosen each season to fill any openings in the permanent company. For them, the ensemble offers a chance to work and develop their craft - a valued opportunity for any actor, but especially precious for those whose handicap severely limits their choices.Elena Blue, a deaf 27-year-old actress, is one of two company members alternating in ''All the Way Home'' in the starring role of Mary, the part played by Miss Dewhurst on Broadway. In the past, Mrs. Blue had performed in small community theaters for deaf audiences. She calls working with the National Theater of the Deaf ''the ultimate experience I've ever had in my whole life.''Helping to Change PerceptionsThrough an interpreter, she explains, ''Now I'm an actor for hearing people as well as deaf people. It's like opening a door. One of the things we're doing is showing, 'here we are' - we're deaf actors, we're good, as good as hearing actors. People out there perceive deaf people as different, but I say no, because I can stand up for two hours and give a performance and I can make them say, no, they're not different. I can cry, as you cry; I can laugh, the same as you can laugh. That's a wonderful feeling, showing how we're all the same.''New to the method and to sign language, Miss Dewhurst was initially apprehensive about working with the company. ''I was very frightened,'' she says. ''I think you're always frightened of the unknown.''Her concerns were twofold: ''that I would not be able to communicate and that in some way it would be a lost cause,'' she says.Instead, she has found that signing enhances rather than detracts from the play, becoming ''another dimension.''''Signing is a language, a very sophisticated language,'' she says, ''and with some of these actors you'll see great beauty in their signing. The signing can become aggressive, or loving; it has a great deal to tell us about body language.''Highly Expressive Sign LanguageThe form of sign language used by the actors is highly expressive. ''It's not the same sign language you'll see on the street,'' Mr. Hays says. ''It's elevated, intensified, broadened, enlarged. It's a very physical communication; the stage is full of motion.''The mode of presentation did necessitate certain changes in the text, mainly small cuts which Miss Dewhurst made herself after informing Mr. Mosel of her intentions. ''I told him there would be changes, and he said, ''I unconditionally surrender,''' she reports with a grin.Miss Dewhurst has a very clear view of what she as an actress wants in a director - and what she as a director wants to be for her actors. ''You're there to take the actors to a danger area they've never been to before,'' she explains, ''to pull them that one more inch beyond what they can do easily. You want a director who forces you to go there, who lets you go there - whom you trust.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/27/science/implant-brings-sound-to-deaf-and-spurs-debate-over-its-use.html", "headline": "IMPLANT BRINGS SOUND TO DEAF AND SPURS DEBATE OVER ITS USE", "date": "1984-03-27T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 27, 1984, Section C, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Everyone was overjoyed, because the man had been totally deaf for more than a year. Now he had been brought back into the world of sound at least sufficiently to respond to the human voice, although he did not quite recognize the sound as ''Charles.''This scene at Bellevue Hospital last week illustrates the hopes as well as the limitations of cochlear implants, electronic devices implanted surgically in the inner ear, to aid people whose hearing is profoundly impaired. The cochlea is a structure of the inner ear, shaped like a snail shell, where the vibrations of sound are translated into nerve impulses.Although the field is still considered in its infancy, cochlear implants have become the focus of considerable enthusiasm - and controversy - in the medical community. Such implant operations are being done more widely today than ever before.The hopeful side in the recent case was that the man could again hear the human voice, and presumably the sound of a door slamming or a truck approaching a crosswalk. He was no longer deprived of all the auditory cues that people with normal hearing take for granted, but which are vital in social interactions and even safety. He had been deprived of all these cues when his hearing was destroyed by meningitis.But the treatment had important limitations. The patient responded automatically to his name, but he did not quite recognize the sound. He heard something else that sounded at first like ''a bunch of Martians.'' He was delighted to recognize, after a moment, that he was hearing his own voice. But he was far from being able to understand conversational speech.Specialists consider anything close to normal hearing to be a hope only for the future of cochlear implants. No one knows just how far in the future or what type of patient might achieve it. Indeed, there is much disagreement over what benefits can be claimed from cochlear implants, who should receive them and even whether today's models are worth the expense, the time and the trouble for any purpose beyond research.Typically such a device consists of a receiver, like that of a conventional hearing aid; a speech processing minicomputer that translates the sound signals into electrical form and can be carried in a pocket; a re ceiver for those electrical signals implanted under the skin behind and above the ear, and a thin wire cable inserted surgically through the mastoid bone into the cochlea to transmit the electrical signals.A decade ago most medical specialists in hearing problems had little hope for such implants, according to an article in the American Medical Association's journal Archives of Otolaryngology. Even a few years ago such treatment had few supporters, according to the authors, Dr. Josef M. Miller and Dr. Bryan E. Pfingst of the University of Washington in Seattle. Today, they said, there are many supporters.Over a year ago the A.M.A. approved use of cochlear implants in some circumstances, and those experienced in this relatively new and expanding field tend to be hopeful but cautious. They are all concerned that prospective patients may have hopes too high to be realized.''The patients should not expect, at all, to hear the way they did prior to deafness,'' said Dr. Noel Cohen of New York University and Bellevue Hospital during a recent interview.Viewed as Aid to Lip Reading''The key thing is that it will greatly aid lip reading,'' said Dr. Susan Waltzman, audiologist of the Bellevue cochlear implant team. This, although limited, is considered an important achievement in itself.But the doctors say that some prospective patients have unrealistic hopes from the operations before the facts are explained to them.Several varieties of cochlear implant devices have been developed in recent years, each representing a different strategy but all designed to help the profoundly deaf. Clinical research projects to test several models of the implants in patients have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.The patients who might benefit from such devices are often described as having ''nerve deafness,'' but most of the cases do not actually involve damage to the nerve trunk that transmits the signals representing sound to the brain. If the problem really is nerve damage, an implant will not help.Dr. Cohen said most ''nerve deafness'' cases actually represent damage to the cochlea resulting from infections, from the use of some medicinal drugs needed to treat life-threatening illness and from physical injury.The devices are inserted surgically in the cochlea, a structure in the inner ear, which translates sounds from mechanical vibrations into electrical signals. The electrical signals are produced by cells in the cochlea that are topped by a fringe of minute hairs and are called hair cells. The hairs, bending in response to vibrations from the outer and middle ear, produce electrical signals that stimulate the auditory nerve and, through that nerve trunk, send the messages that the brain interprets as sounds.The natural system is incredibly sensitive and versatile, able to accommodate the full range of human speech, the whisper of wind in the trees, the blare of a trumpet and the blast of artillery. But, when the hair cells in the cochlea are damaged by disease or injury, the signal transmission is shut off and the person's world goes silent.Conventional Aids Are UselessMore than 200,000 Americans are believed to suffer from this profound kind of hearing loss. For them, conventional hearing aids are useless. These external devices simply transmit sounds as physical vibrations to the inner ear. If the cochlea is not functioning, the transmission stops there and never gets to the brain.The purpose of a cochlear implant is to transmit electrical signals directly to the nerve fibers, bypassing the damaged hair cells.The group at N.Y.U.-Bellevue has done two implants, the most recent one last week, with a highly sophisticated device developed in Australia by scientists at University of Melbourne and an Australian company called Nucleus Limited. The device is now being tried in patients in F.D.A.- approved clinical research at N.Y.U. and other American medical centers.Dr. Cohen and Dr. Waltzman believe present use of such devices should be limited to carefully chosen adults who had learned to speak before illness or injury left them totally deaf. Any patient who derives benefit from any conventional hearing aid is eliminated as a cochlear implant prospect in their program. Elsewhere, however, specialists have implanted the devices in congenitally deaf children and even in persons who are deaf in only one ear.One unanswered question is whether or not long-term electrical stimulation might, itself, damage tissues in the ear.Medical Guidelines DevelopedMedical scientists at Yale University and the West Haven Veterans Administration Hospital in Connecticut expect to do their first cochlear implant soon in another F.D.A.-approved program. They are also doing research, under a Veterans Administration grant, for what is to be a comprehensive set of medical guidelines for the use of such implants, according to Dr. Frederick Richardson of the Yale team.The cochlear implant the Yale group will use was developed at the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles, primarily by Dr. William F. House, a medical scientist who has had great experience in the research and use of such devices. About 300 adults and 100 children and adolescents have received implants in his program, Dr. House said in a recent interview.His group is collaborating in F.D.A.-approved clinical trials with 30 medical teams thoughout the country that are implanting the devices in adults, and with seven groups inserting implants in children and adolescents. They are using a model made by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company of St. Paul. It is known as the 3M-House device.Dr. House's youngest case was a child not yet three years old at the time of the operation. Although he concedes that use of the implants in children is controversial, Dr. House considers it important to try. It might prove possible, he said, to give a congenitally deaf child a better ability to speak and even read, since reading usually begins as an auditory skill that depends on a child's interpretation of the sounds that go with written words. To learn language without sound, he said, is much like the problem a person who speaks only English would have in trying to learn to read Chinese ideographs without any exposure to the spoken language.He said it is still too early to tell whether such implants will really help congenitally deaf children. Clearly, he said, the devices help some adults in conjunction with lip reading.The cost of the implants at his center is about $12,000 including the surgery, the equipment, training sessions and related rehabilitation work with the patient, he said.One problem in evaluation, Dr. House said, is that there is great variation among patients and it is hard to draw conclusions from a few.Dr. House, who is a clinical professor at the University of Southern California, has been doing research on cochlear implants for 20 years. He implanted his first one in a patient 15 years ago and, five years ago, decided the time was ripe for a major clinical trial.In the middle 1970's, he said, the field of cochlear implants was at a stage about comparable to that of aviation at the time of Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic. Today the situation is like the earliest days of commercial passenger flying, he said. Dr. House stresses that there is a long way to go before cochlear implants reach the jet age.Multichannel Devices DevelopedThe device developed by Dr. House's group is called a single channel implant. The part that goes into the cochlea is essentially a wire with one electrode to transmit the signal. In multichannel devices there is a thin cable with multiple electrodes.The Australian device in use by the group at N.Y.U.-Bellevue is multichannel. It is considered one of the most sophisticated in use today.Jim Patrick, a Nucleus Limited engineer who visited Bellevue last week, said the human cochlea processes sound signals of different wavelength at different locations along its coil-shaped structure. The multichannel device has 22 electrodes, each of which transmits a different frequency band.The thin cable containing them is threaded into the cochlear coil. Afterward the voice-processing computer package that will provide the signal is programmed so that the signals sent to each electrode match the capabilities of the nerve fibers accessible in that part of the cochlea. It is a complex matter of fine-tuning the signal in the hope of giving the patient the maximum benefit from the device.Specialists say it is still too early to draw firm conclusions on the relative merits of the various devices.Early Results PromisingAnother highly sophisticated multichannel device was developed at the University of Utah and has been approved by the F.D.A. for clinical trials in 20 patients. The university and Kolf Medical Inc., a technology company that is producing the devices, recently announced results obtained with the first few patients who have received the implants.These included two totally deaf patients who, in hearing tests unaided by lip reading, correctly identified 40 percent to 80 percent of random, unrehearsed two-syllable words. The research team in Utah included these scores in the data sent to the F.D.A. The results are impressive, but they, too, fall far short of what would be needed to understand normal conversation, experts say.''The bottom line is that all of these devices are lip reading aids,'' said Dr. Donald K. Eddington, the scientist who did the basic research for the device when he was at University of Utah. He is now at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston.''Basically the patients are able to carry on conversations on a one to one basis with the help of lip reading,'' he said. ''They cannot do it without lip reading.''He and others in the field are not apologetic in making such statements. The progress during the past several years has been substantial, and the help to some patients is undeniable. But the specialists who deal with these difficult cases do not want to add the pain of dashed hopes to the problems with which all profoundly deaf persons must cope today."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/03/business/technologysteven-j-marcus-implant-in-ear-aids-the-deaf.html", "headline": "TechnologySteven J.

Biostim Inc. of Princeton, N.J., calls its device the Bioear. A joint venture of the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles and the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company currently dominates the field with its House-3M Cochlear Implant. And Nucleus Ltd., an Australian entry in the American market, offers a Multichannel Cochlear Implant.The four companies, combining advances in medicine and microelectronics, are seeking to provide some hearing to people whose deafness is too profound to be helped by ordinary hearing aids.The work is based on a new technology that approximates sound signals with electrical impulses delivered by devices implanted in the inner ear.None of the four products is offered commercially; each is at some stage of clinical evaluation under an ''investigational-device exemption'' granted by the Food and Drug Administration. But approximately 450 implants have been performed worldwide, and the results are encouraging enough to predict that some deaf people may soon be able to regain some hearing.For those who are nerve deaf, having suffered damage to the sensory hair cells within the cochlea, or inner ear, that transmit sound to nerve endings and the brain, a cochlear implant can in effect ''reconnect the cut wires,'' says Biostim's president, Lloyd A. Ferreira.There are 300,000 people in the United States whom specialists consider profoundly deaf; damage to their hair cells is so extensive that hearing aids are useless. And it is estimated that about two-thirds of them could benefit from implants. Two million others have suffered partial impairment of the hair cells and cannot understand speech without a hearing aid, but it is still too soon to say how many could do better with implants.The devices, which resemble a Sony Walkman, cost about $5,000. But surgery, hospital charges and therapy raise the total cost to about $15,000, and for a relatively primitive system. People in the field expect that the size of the device will become smaller, more sophisticated and more expensive, and that its application could expand. ''I have absolutely no doubt,'' Mr. Ferreira says, ''that the business will eventually achieve annual sales of $1 billion or more.''Business & Economy: Latest UpdatesUpdated\u00a0Feb. 4, 2022, 6:02 p.m. ETA new inflation figure and Twitter earnings: the week ahead in business.Delta\u2019s chief executive asks U.S. to bar unruly passengers from flying.Here\u2019s what you need to know about the January jobs report.At the moment, says Pieter Halter, executive editor of Biomedical Business International, a journal of the health-care industry, the market is embryonic, with sales in the United States, for research purposes only, of about $1 million. But he says this figure may exceed $40 million by 1988. ''There will be very rapid growth,'' he says, ''but probably not as rapid as Lloyd predicts.''Experts agree that House-3M was first into the field - its device has been implanted in 380 patients - and could be approved promptly by the F.D.A. once application is made. William F. House, president of the House Ear Institute, estimates that it could be commercial within six to eight months. But although such status would allow this implant to have the market to itself for several years, 3M seems disinclined to rush.''We are not in this for a quick killing,'' says Robert J. Oliveira, manager of 3M's Otologic Products program. Greater understanding of the complex hearing process must be gained before the benefits of a device - even a relatively simple one like the House-3M implant - can be assessed. Thus 3M is committed, Dr. Oliveira says, to long- term research that would spare patients from unrealistic expectations and perhaps develop new areas of technology for the company. ''To think in terms of a huge market right now,'' he says, ''would weaken the effort.''Another reason for delay could be the limits of the device itself. With a single channel for electrical signals, the perceived sound ''sounds like a radio that isn't quite tuned in,'' Dr. House says. And although it gives the patient the ability to discern ''environmental sounds'' like footsteps or a siren, and to hear voices, the patient cannot distinguish all the words.Robert K. Jarvik, inventor of the Jarvik artificial heart and now president of Kolff Medical, says patients have been satisfied so far with single- channel cochlear implants simply because it took them ''from nothing to something.'' These enable them to hear tones and improve their lip-reading, he says, but only multiple-channel systems and other advances in speech-processing electronics can provide something akin to real hearing.Dr. House acknowledges that multichannel implants seem to advance the technology. The Nucleus system, he says, ''is the most complex and sophisticated system available.'' But he adds that ''more sophisticated doesn't mean best,'' and that clinical trials have yet to show that the approach will deliver on its promise.Developers of the newer products aacknowledge that their confidence, although not without basis, is premature; the Nucleus system has been implanted in 12 patients and the Kolff in only 4. ''We bear reasonably good news,'' Dr. Jarvik says, ''but we still have a long way to go.''Yet if clinical trials prove successful, he adds, such products could be ''broadly available within two to three years.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/25/theater/theater-of-the-deaf-gets-a-picture-postcard-home.html", "headline": "THEATER OF THE DEAF GETS A PICTURE-POSTCARD HOME", "date": "1983-07-25T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 25, 1983, Section C, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Stark Center, in Chester, Conn., yesterday. Situated in a picturesque spot along the Pattaconk Brook, the Stark Center was established with a $250,000 gift from Irving Stark, a retired businessman from East Norwalk, Conn.''We finally have a home,'' David Hays, founder and artistic director of the theater, said. ''It is justterrific. It is just the right size. This town is so pretty; it's like the backlot of M-G-M. The people here have welcomed us with open arms.''The Stark Center consists of two 19th-century cream-color clapboard buildings, a church and a factory, which have been renovated. The church has been turned into a large rehearsal hall and dining facility, and the factory has been transformed into offices, a classroom and a small rehearsal studio.''We are a touring theater, and we have avoided having to maintain a home base,'' Mr. Hayes said. ''But Mr. Stark has given us buildings and the renovation, which means that our organization is not bound by heavy debt. We don't have to do anything but support our work.'' Synthesis of Speech and SignA professional company, the National Theater of the Deaf is a troupe of 12 actors, 10 of whom are deaf. They perform using a synthesis of spoken English and sign language. The company has an annual operating budget of close to $1 million and tours about 22 weeks a year, including six weeks abroad.''We have toured abroad more than any other American theater company,'' Mr. Hayes said. Among the actors who have trained at the National Theater of the Deaf is Phyllis Frelich, who won a Tony Award on Broadway for her performance as a star of Mark Medoff's play ''Children of a Lesser God.''Miss Frelich is teaching this summer at the National Theater of the Deaf's Professional School for Deaf Theater Personnel, which has trained hundreds of deaf actors. The school is now at the Stark Center.Mr. Hayes once said of his company, ''We are Theater of the Deaf, but not for the deaf.'' He observed that 85 percent of the company's audiences are people who can hear. From Voltaire to ThurberThe National Theater of the Deaf has performed such works as Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'' and Gertrude Stein's ''Four Saints in Three Acts,'' and has adapted works from such diverse sources as Voltaire, Alexandre Dumas and James Thurber. The company also develops its own original material.The Stark Center is a memorial to Mr. Stark's late wife, Hazel, who died last year. She was a lifetime member of the Actors' Fund and was a member of the board of the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn.Founded in 1967, the National Theater of the Deaf used the facilities of the O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., until 1981."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/06/us/deaf-blind-woman-to-get-college-degree.html", "headline": "DEAF, BLIND WOMAN TO GET COLLEGE DEGREE", "date": "1983-06-06T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 6, 1983, Section B, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Kerry O'Brien, a social worker with the Victim Services Agency, asked the students gathered for a special assembly at St. Joseph's School for the Deaf.''It's bad men doing bad things,'' said one boy. ''It's robbery,'' said another. ''It's rape,'' said a girl. ''Kidnapping,'' said a boy. ''Killing,'' said a girl.The children were obviously familiar with the definitions of crime; indeed many of them live in high-crime neighborhoods. But because they are profoundly deaf, which means they cannot hear words at all, they are especially vulnerable to crime.''In deaf children, one of the senses on which we depend to detect the presence of danger is lost,'' said Pamela McDonnell, co-director of the Safety and Fitness Exchange. ''If they were being followed, they couldn't hear noises or footsteps.''The Safety and Fitness Exchange, which is known as SAFE, conducts workshops on self-protection for schools, hospitals, community organizations and corporations as well as individuals in its educational center, a Safe Space, in Manhattan. It is collaborating with the Victim Services Agency in an effort to teach the disabled to defend themselves despite their handicaps. The Victim Services Agency works to reduce the trauma suffered by crime victims. An Earlier ProgramThe two organizations had already conducted a program for elderly people with hearing impairments or cerebral palsy on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and decided to contact St. Joseph's School. The 114-year-old private nursery and elementary school at 1000 Hutchinson River Parkway in the Bronx is supported by state funds and has an enrollment of 210 children 6 months to 15 years old.Miss McDonnell and Mr. O'Brien demonstrated for two groups of children, 10 to 15 years old, several potentially dangerous confrontations and discussed how best to respond. Teachers took turns signing, that is, translating the remarks into sign language.Miss McDonnell strolled into an imaginary subway station, announcing that she had overslept and was not feeling well. ''Maybe you're a mugger,'' she said. ''Look at me; see if I'm a person you might want to pick.'' Clearly, she was an ideal target for she left her handbag open on the floor while she searched for a token. Mr. O'Brien whisked past her and grabbed the bag with ease.Then she tried again. This time she strode energetically into the station and held her bag close. Mr. O'Brien passed her by. ''My body looked stronger,'' she said. ''Even if you're not big, you can look strong.''Enacting a more dangerous situation, Mr. O'Brien grabbed Miss Mc-Donnell from behind and held a knife to her neck. ''Now it is important for me to stay alive, so I will try to cooperate,'' she said. ''Try to tell him that you're deaf, but not too fast because that will scare him. He will be nervous; he might be on drugs. And if you cannot talk, you might gesture to him that you're deaf and mouth the word 'deaf.' Plan ahead.''She explained that sometimes in extreme situations physical retaliation might be necessary, and she showed the children the most effective ways of striking back by aiming at the person's weak spots. She rejected the obvious, such as kicking the offender in the groin, showing how he might grab her leg. ''It's much better to hit him in the neck or the eyes, or just under the nose, which snaps his head back,'' she said. She also advocated a kick to the knees. And if the man held her from behind, as in the demonstration? ''Stamp on his foot,'' she said. She cautioned that such physical resistance should be used only in cases when the victim felt his life was in danger and when it seemed impossible to run away or attract help.Although much of Miss McDonnell's advice was universally applicable, some of it was directed specifically to the deaf. For example, she suggested that if an intruder entered the home when the child was alone and unable to use the phone or scream, throwing objects out the window would be sure to attract attention - and help. ''It is often difficult for the deaf who do speak to make themselves understood on the telephone,'' she said. 'Very Protected by Parents'Between the sessions, Therese O'Connor, an educational supervisor at the school, said: ''Many deaf children tend to view themselves as immune from threats. Deaf children are very protected by their parents until they are adolescents, so they don't match what mother says with actual experience.''Still, more than one student had already encountered danger, and they described their experiences, using sign language and speech. Kathleen Frawley, 13, recalled: ''Last December, I was walking to the bus stop after school and passed a gas station. A man there asked, 'Do you want to ride with me?' I said, 'No.' Then he drove close and waved to me. I shook my head and he left.''Robert Daly, 14, described an encounter he had last year: ''I went to the park alone one morning to play basketball. There was no one else there. Then three strange men came bicycling in and came near me. One started to play ball, while the others went to swing. He asked to borrow my basketball. I said, 'No.' Then they all started to push me, and one man punched my eye. I ran home.''Although they expressed confidence in themselves, the students were also aware of the difficulties created by their hearing disabilities. Ismael Garcia said: ''The deaf are misunderstood, and I fear not being able to communicate. But you have better control if you can see, so I use my eyes a lot.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/28/theater/gift-establishes-first-home-for-national-deaf-theater.html", "headline": "GIFT ESTABLISHES FIRST HOME FOR NATIONAL DEAF THEATER", "date": "1983-04-28T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 28, 1983, Section C, Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The contribution will establish the Hazel E. Stark Center of the National Theater of the Deaf in Chester, Conn.The company is a professional touring troupe of actors, some of whom are deaf, who perform using a synthesis of spoken English and American sign language. Since its founding in 1967, the National Theater of the Deaf has used the facilities of the O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn.Although the site of the center, two 19th-century buildings, will undergo restoration, the theater's administrative staff has already begun to move in. The center will be used for rehearsals; for the training of company aspirants as well as of the company itself, and for exploratory work. The actors continually search for new ways to use sign language theatrically, and they adapt plays as well as develop new ones. 'Lifelong Interest in Theater'In announcing the gift, Mr. Stark said, ''The center will be a fitting memorial to my late wife, Hazel, who had a lifelong interest in theater and the disadvantaged.

''I hated asking them to do me a favor every time,'' she said. ''I was not an independent person.''But for several years now, the 63-year-old Mrs. Solomon has placed her own calls at home, using a typewriterlike telecommunications device for the deaf (known as a T.D.D. to those who use and sell them), which is connected to a conventional telephone. It allows her to conduct conversations in print over phone lines with others who have similar equipment.Mrs. Solomon is one of about 140,000 profoundly deaf people who live in the New York metropolitan area, according to the most recent National Census of the Deaf Population, issued in 1974. The census found that there were 1.8 million such people nationwide. Profound deafness - according to Dr. Jerome D. Schein, project director of the census report and professor of deafness rehabilitation at New York University - is a hearing impairment that makes one unable to carry on a conversation with the eyes closed, or unable to hear more than four of every 10 spoken words.To provide phone service to those with severe hearing impairments, some 100,000 T.D.D.'s are in use nationwide by individuals, government agencies, hospitals and retailers, among others.Also available are devices that use the senses of sight or touch to alert the deaf to such things as ringing doorbells, telephones or alarm clocks; the cry of a baby, or even the noise of an attempted break-in. Special smoke detectors are sold as well; usually, they cause a light to flash or a bed pillow or mattress to vibrate.Much of the equipment is expensive. Most home T.D.D.'s, for example, cost from $400 to $600. But computer technology is gradually reducing the prices and making the machines more compact and versatile. Some are battery-operated and can be carried in a purse or briefcase.Moreover, inexpensive home computers can be used for two-way communication and to gain access to nationwide ''electronic mail'' systems. Some T.D.D.'s can ''talk'' to computers, and special attachments can permit some personal computers to communicate with conventional T.D.D.'s.Many phone companies - including Illinois Bell, New Jersey Bell and Southern New England Telephone, which serves most of Connecticut - lease or sell T.D.D.'s. In California, a 1981 bill requires the state's phone companies to provide the equipment free to people who have been certified by a doctor as deaf. The cost is covered by a 5-cent-a-month surcharge on all phone bills.The National Association of the Deaf, in Silver Spring, Md., supports such legislation. ''Our feeling is that this is not a charity,'' said Muriel Strassler, the organization's director of public information. ''Telephone companies have a license from the government to provide a service to all citizens. And deaf people, as citizens of the state, should have the same access at no additional cost.''Starting next month, the State of Connecticut plans to lend 180 T.D.D.'s each year, at no charge, to state residents who have speech or hearing impairments. The project is being paid for by Southern New England Telephone and administered by the State Commission on the Deaf and Hearing Impaired in Hartford.New York Telephone offers T.D.D.'s for lease or purchase in two communities it serves in Connecticut - Greenwich and Byram - because that state requires it to, but it makes none available to its customers in New York. Robert Harkay, a division staff manager in marketing support for New York Telephone, said: ''We felt it wasn't a good marketing decision, since our distribution costs would require higher charges than people pay to buy the devices direct from manufacturers and distributors. We're unaware of any major demand from the disabled community.''The New York Public Service Commission is studying whether New York Telephone could offer T.D.D.'s at a reasonable price, according to Richard S. Hesser, the commission's chief of rates. And State Senator John E. Flynn, a Yonkers Republican who is chairman of the Select Committee on the Disabled, has introduced a bill to require all the state's phone companies to sell T.D.D.'s to the public at their wholesale cost.Telecommunications devices for the deaf cost from $200 to $4,000, with the most expensive models for commercial use. One of the two types available is the heavy-duty teletypewriter, or TTY, which provides paper copies of incoming and outgoing messages. Because it is large and expensive, it may not be best for home use. However, less expensive models can be obtained, usually older machines donated by businesses.More easily accommodated in the home are machines that are increasingly available in portable models that run either on batteries or on house current. They usually have display screens for messages, and some also produce a paper tape readout.Many users have T.D.D.'s at both home and work. One who does is Michael Schwartz, 29, a lawyer in the Manhattan District Attorney's office. He said his social life, in particular, became more interesting when he got his first one. ''I'm able to contact more of my friends and keep up to date on local events conducted for the deaf,'' he said.Signal-alert equipment for the home, ranging from less than $5 to several hundred dollars, is either @single- or multipurpose. One new computerized, wireless system has several sound monitors transmitting to a receiver. The receiver has as many as eight lights to alert the user to such things as a doorbell, a baby's cough or a smoke alarm.Mary Beth Miller, the coordinator of education at the New York Society for the Deaf, said her new wireless phone- and door-signal system is a big improvement over the handmade arrangement of wires she used to have ''lying around all over the place.''Another electronic aid - closed-caption television programming - has ''probably brought the most significant change in a deaf person's life since the development of sign language,'' according to Joel D. Ziev, executive director of the New York Society for the Deaf. With a decoder that costs $279, viewers can see subtitles on some news and entertainment shows on ABC and NBC and on Public Broadcasting Service stations. Captioned video cassette movies can also be purchased or rented.Both computers and T.D.D.'s that use computer code give the deaf access to ''electronic mail'' systems that are available to the general public, such as the Source, in McLean, Va. Other computerized ''bulletin boards,'' like Deafnet, based in Framingham, Mass., are especially for the deaf.Other devices are still in development. Among them is a vibrating wrist watch that the Electronic Design and Packaging Company of Allen Park, Mich., is working on. Using a transmitter in the home, the watch could alert the wearer to up to a dozen sounds, represented on the watch face by numerical codes or pictures."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/03/garden/organizations-that-assist-the-deaf.html", "headline": "ORGANIZATIONS THAT ASSIST THE DEAF", "date": "1983-03-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 3, 1983, Section C, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The majority opinion was written by Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist, and the dissenting opinion by Associate Justice Byron R. White. For the Majority Justice RehnquistThis case presents a question of statutory interpretation. Petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals and the District Court misconstrued the requirements imposed by Congress upon states which receive Federal funds under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. We agree and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 provides Federal money to assist state and local agencies in educating handicapped children, and conditions such funding upon a state's compliance with extensive goals and procedures.In order to qualify for Federal financial assistance under the act, a state must demonstrate that it ''has in effect a policy that assures all handicapped children the right to a free appropriate public education.'' The ''free appropriate public education'' required by the act is tailored to the unique needs of the handicapped child or means of an ''individualized education program'' (IEP).This case arose in connection with the education of Amy Rowley, a deaf student at the Furnace Woods School in the Hendrick Hudson Central School District, Peekskill, N.Y. Amy has minimal residual hearing and is an excellent lip reader. During the year before she began attending Furnace Woods, a meeting between her parents and school administrators resulted in a decision to place her in a regular kindergarten class in order to determine what supplemental services would be necessary.Amy successfully completed her kindergarten year. As required by the act, an IEP was prepared for Amy during the fall of her firstgrade year. The IEP provided that Amy should be educated in a regular classroom at Furnace Woods, should continue to use the FM hearing aid, and should receive instruction from a tutor for the deaf for one hour each day and from a speech therapist for three hours each week.The Rowleys agreed with the IEP but insisted that Amy also be provided a qualified sign-language interpreter in all of her academic classes. Such an interpreter had been placed in Amy's kindergarten class for a two-week experimental period, but the interpreter had reported that Amy did not need his services at that time. The school administrators likewise concluded that Amy did not need such an interpreter in her first-grade classroom.When their request for an interpreter was denied, the Rowleys demanded and received a hearing before an independent examiner. After receiving evidence from both sides, the examiner agreed with the administrators' determination that an interpreter was not necessary because ''Amy was achieving educationally, academically and socially'' without such assistance.The examiner's decision was affirmed on appeal by the New York Commissioner of Education. The Rowleys then brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.The District Court found that Amy ''is a remarkably well-adjusted child'' who interacts and communicates well with her classmates and has ''developed an extraordinary rapport'' with her teachers. It also found that ''she performs better than the average child in her class and is advancing easily from grade to grade,'' but ''that she understands considerably less of what goes on in class than she would if she were not deaf.''This disparity between Amy's achievement and her potential led the court to decide that she was not receiving a ''free appropriate public education,'' which the court defined as ''an opportunity to achieve (her) full potential commensurate with the opportunity provided to other children.''A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.We granted certiorari to review the lower courts' interpretation of the act. Such review requires us to consider two questions: What is meant by the act's requirement of a ''free appropriate public education?'' And what is the role of state and Federal courts in exercising the review granted by Section 1415 of the act?According to the definitions contained in the act, a ''free appropriate public education'' consists of educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child, supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child ''to benefit'' from the instruction. If personalized instruction is being provided with sufficient supportive services to permit the child to benefit from the instruction and the other items on the definitional checklist are satisfied, the child is receiving a ''free appropriate public education'' as defined by the act.Noticeably absent from the language of the statute is any substantive standard prescribing the level of education to be accorded handicapped children. Certainly the language of the statute contains no requirement like the one imposed by the lower courts - that states maximize the potential of handicapped children ''commensurate with the opportunity provided to other children.''Implicit in the Congressional purpose of providing access to a ''free appropriate public education'' is the requirement that the education to which access is provided be sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child. We therefore conclude that the ''basic floor of opportunity'' provided by the act consists of access to specialized instruction and related services which are individually designed to provide educational benefit to the handicapped child.Insofar as a state is required to provide a handicapped child with a ''free appropriate public education,'' we hold that it satisfies this requirement by providing personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from that instruction. Such instruction and services must be provided at public expense.In addition, the IEP, and therefore the personalized instruction, should be formulated in accordance with the requirements of the act and, if the child is being educated in the regular classrooms of the public education system, should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade. Dissenting Justice WhiteIn order to reach its result in this case, the majority opinion contradicts itself, the language of the statute and the legislative history. Both the majority's standard for a ''free appropriate education'' and its standard for judicial review disregard Congressional intent.The majority read this statutory language as establishing a Congressional intent limited to bringing ''previously excluded handicapped children into the public education systems of the states and requiring the states to adopt procedures which would result in individualized consideration of and instruction for each child.''I agree that the language of the act does not contain a substantive standard beyond requiring that the education offered must be ''appropriate.'' However, if there are limits not evident from the face of the statute on what may be considered an ''appropriate education,'' they must be found in the purpose of the statute or its legislative history. The act itself announces it will provide a ''full educational opportunity to all handicapped children.'' This goal is repeated throughout the legislative history, in statements too frequent to be ''passing references and isolate phrases.''The legislative history thus directly supports the conclusion that the act intends to give handicapped children an educational opportunity commensurate with that given other children.The majority opinion announces a different substantive standard, that ''Congress did not impose upon the states any greater substantive standard than would be necessary to make such access meaningful.'' While ''meaningful'' is no more enlightening than ''appropriate,'' the Court purports to clarify itself. Because Amy was provided with some specialized instruction from which she obtained some benefit, and because she passed from grade to grade, she was receiving a meaningful and therefore appropriate education.This falls far short of what the act intended. The act details as specifically as possible the kind of specialized education each handicapped child must receive. It would apparently satisfy the Court's standard of ''access to specialized instruction and related services which are individually designed to provide educational benefit to the handicapped child'' for a deaf child such as Amy to be given a teacher with a loud voice, for she would benefit from that service.The act requires more. Amy Rowley, without a sign-language interpreter, comprehends less than half of what is said in the classroom - less than half of what normal children comprehend. This is hardly an equal opportunity to learn, even if Amy makes passing grades.Despite its reliance on the use of ''appropriate'' in the definition of the act, the majority opinion speculates that ''Congress used the word as much to describe the settings in which the children should be educated as to prescribe the substantive content or supportive services of their education.'' Of course, the word ''appropriate'' can be applied in many ways; at times in the act, Congress used it to recommend mainstreaming handicapped children; at other points, it used the word to refer to the content of the individualized education.The issue before us is what standard the word ''appropriate'' incorporates when it is used to modify ''education.'' The answer given by the Court is not a satisfactory one."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/14/us/deaf-blind-and-now-phd.html", "headline": "DEAF, BLIND, AND NOW Ph.D.", "date": "1982-06-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 14, 1982, Section A, Page 16Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The complaint said that defendants, Dr. Adam J. Sortini and others, decided that the hearing was normal. It turned out she was deaf because of a hereditary ailment. The record states that the Turpins had meantime conceived a second child, Joy, who was born deaf.The Turpins sued, saying they would not have conceived the second child had they known of the hereditary deafness. The special damages were awarded to cover ''extraordinary expenses for specialized teaching, training and hearing equipment that she will incur during her lifetime.''"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/05/opinion/quiet-diplomacy-deaf-chile.html", "headline": "Quiet Diplomacy, Deaf Chile", "date": "1982-04-05T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 5, 1982, Section A, Page 22Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Please make just some little concession to human rights, asks the Reagan Administration quietly, and Chile can be certified as qualifying for renewed American aid.How does General Pinochet's regime respond? It assigns to its Washington embassy, as military attache, a colonel compelled to resign the same job in Bonn because of charges that he was a notorious torturer of political prisoners.Nor is that the only response. Chile continues contemptuously to refuse help in bringing to justice the murderers of Orlando Letelier, an exiled leftist, on the streets of Washington in 1976. In the pungent judgment of a Justice Department official working on the case, ''Chile hasn't done spit.'' To its credit, Justice refuses to certify otherwise to Congress, which rightly insists on evidence that Chile is moving to punish the assassins.The return to elective government in Chile, meanwhile, has been delayed to the end of the decade - this, mind you, in the country with South America's longest tradition of multiparty democracy. Human rights petitioners are routinely banished. The tempo of official killings seems to be increasing again; Tucapal Jimenez was recently found with his throat cut just after he summoned the trade unions to oppose the regime.The Chilean leaders are no more impressed by the Reagan Administration's private remonstrances than they were by Washington's public concern. Clearly, aid should continue to be withheld, and the Administration should now - loudly - explain why."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/24/nyregion/first-deaf-lawyer-goes-before-supreme-court.html", "headline": "FIRST DEAF LAWYER GOES BEFORE SUPREME COURT", "date": "1982-03-24T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 24, 1982, Section B, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Chatoff, who can speak but not hear, communicated with the nine Justices during oral arguments by reading their questions and then speaking back to them.''This is a tough world, and it is going to be as tough for Amy as it is for every other child,'' said Mr. Chatoff in halting, dissonant speech, as the Justices leaned forward in their seats to be able to hear. ''If she's going to be able to compete she must receive an education equal to those of other children.''First Time for Such EquipmentIt was the first time the Court had permitted the use of special electronic equipment in the courtroom. It did so specifically for this case, in which it must decide whether a Westchester school district may be required by law to provide a sign-language interpreter for Amy Rowley, a deaf fourth-grade student from Cortlandt, N.Y., who is in the top half of her class.It was also the Court's first opportunity to define what Congress meant in the Education For All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which says that all handicapped children are entitled to a ''free appropriate public education.''Raymond G. Kuntz of Bedford Village, N.Y., who represented the Westchester school district, argued that the District Court's ruling in favor of Amy's interpreter had established a costly precedent that could result in an explosion of similar cases.He challenged the jurisdiction of Federal courts in determining the ''appropriate'' educational program of a handicapped child, contending that it was a matter for state education officials. He argued that so far as Amy was concerned, the school district had already exceeded its obligations under law by providing her with a wireless FM hearing aid, a speech therapist and other special attentions, including the installation of a special Teletype machine that allowed the school to communicate with Amy's parents -both of whom are deaf - without relying on the telephone.''I don't know how you distinguish Amy's case from all other cases,''said Mr. Kuntz. Case Could Have Broad ImpactThe case could have broad impact on school districts across the nation that now provide special services for 4 million deaf and other handicapped school youngsters. The districts are grappling - in light of dwindling Federal assistance - with whether school districts can afford what is required of them.The Federal Government now provides about 4 percent of New York State's $1.4 billion special education budget for the handicapped, according to state education officials.As Mr. Chatoff began his argument, the courtroom with its Doric marble columns and heavy maroon velvet curtains was silent. The only people standing were Mr. Chatoff and a sign-language interpreter, who was in the rear of the courtroom so that deaf specators could understand. Mr. Chatoff's uncertain voice echoed through the chamber until Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked him a question.Initially, Mr. Chatoff continued speaking, unaware of the Justice's remarks until an assistant, seated to his right, pulled his arm. The lawyer then leaned over to the video screen to read the Justice's question, paused briefly, then stood erect once again to respond.''Will your interpretation of the statute mean that every school board may be required to have an interpreter for every deaf child in the country?'' Justice John P. Stevens asked at one point. Again Mr. Chatoff paused to look at the screen.''Not every deaf child can be educated in a public school,'' Mr. Chatoff responded. ''This case involves Amy and only Amy.'' The cost of a full-time sign-language interpreter is from $20,000 to $25,000, according to the State Education Department. Amy's signlanguage teacher is paid $8,000 a year on a sliding-scale basis for substitute teachers, according to officials of the Hendrick Hudson School District. System Developed at GallaudetUnder the specially installed system in the Court, a stenotypist in the courtroom typed the argument into a computer system on a terminal set up in an adjoining corridor. The computer then translated the stenographic shorthand into English and almost instantly displayed the transcript on Mr. Chatoff's screen. The system was developed by Gallaudet College, a national college for the deaf in Washington.Mr. Chatoff, who had successfully argued the case in two lower Federal courts with the help of a note-taking assistant, lost his hearing during law school as a result of an illness. He could not use a sign-language interpreter during today's argument because, like most other adults who lose their hearing after childhood, he has not acquired sufficient skill in sign and lip reading.One of the questions before the Court was: Does an ''appropriate'' education mean one that enables a child to become a ''functioning member of society'' as the Hendrick Hudson Central School District in Peekskill, N.Y., argued in opposing Amy's interpreter? Reaching Full PotentialOr does it mean giving a handicapped child such as Amy what the Federal District Court in New York ruled was ''an opportunity to achieve his full potential''?Nancy and Clifford Rowley first approached the Hendrick Hudson School District in 1976 before Amy entered kindergarten. When Amy was in the first grade the school district's committee on the handicapped concluded that she could receive an ''appropriate'' education without an interpreter - a finding that was later supported by the state's Commissioner of Education.Mr. Rowley, who is a research chemist, and Mrs. Rowley, who is trained as a teacher of the deaf, were present at today's argument. They said they had left Amy for the day with friends.The Court is expected to decide the case before the end of its term in June or July."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/23/us/high-court-will-let-deaf-lawyer-utilize-video-display-tube.html", "headline": "HIGH COURT WILL LET DEAF LAWYER UTILIZE VIDEO DISPLAY TUBE", "date": "1982-02-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 23, 1982, Section A, Page 17Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Chatoff's proposal to install a video display screen in the courtroom from which he will be able to read the questions the Justices ask during the argument. Mr. Chatoff, a 35-year-old graduate of Brooklyn Law School, can speak but cannot hear. With the help of a note-taking assistant, he successfully argued in two lower Federal courts the case now before the Supreme Court.In a letter to the Court last month, Mr. Chatoff said that the note-taking system missed as much as half of the argument. He asked permission to install a system developed by Gallaudet College, the national college for the deaf, which is a few miles from the Court. Computer Translates SymbolsUnder that system, a stenotypist in the courtroom types the argument into a computer system on a terminal set up in an adjoining corridor. The computer then translates the stenographic shorthand into English and almost instantly displays the transcript on the screen in front of the lawyer.The Court has never before allowed a party in a case to use a recording system or other electronic equipment. Still-photography cameras as well as television cameras are also barred from the courtroom.The case Mr. Chatoff will be arguing is of considerable interest to the deaf community. The question is whether the Hendrick Hudson School District in Westchester County is obliged under a 1975 Federal law to provide a sign-language interpreter for a deaf fourth-grader, Amy Rowley. Mr. Chatoff won the case in the lower courts and the Supreme Court agreed in November to hear the school district's appeal. The argument is scheduled for this spring."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/14/nyregion/deaf-boy-diagnosed-as-retarded-in-error-is-given-2.5-million.html", "headline": "DEAF BOY DIAGNOSED AS RETARDED IN ERROR IS GIVEN $2.5 MILLION", "date": "1982-01-14T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 14, 1982, Section B, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Amann Jr. of the State Court of Claims ruled that as an infant, Donald Snow Jr. of Selden, L.I., was misdiagnosed as an imbecile and was sent to Willowbrook State Hospital on Staten Island.He spent seven years at Willowbrook before being re-evaluated and sent to a state facility in Suffolk County, the judge said.A year la te r, when he was 11, he was returned to his parents, Donald and Ca thy Snow. The Snows filed a claim against the state for malpractice.Judge Amann, who heard the case without a jury, said last night that ''the boy's years at Willowbrook destroyed him.'' ''Although he wasn't retarded to begin with, he was so diagnosed by a private physician and a private hospital,'' Judge Amann said. ''He was rated at an intelligence quotient of 24 when he was two and a half years old and was classified as an imbecile.''The boy was confined in the children's ward at Willowbrook - now the Staten Island Developmental Center. ''Expert witnesses testified that he never had a chance to catch up,'' the judge said.The child was born prematurely in 1962, and two years later was sent to a school for mental defectives on Long Island. In 1965, he was transferred to Willowbrook.He was not re-evaluated by the Willowbrook staff until 1972. When the improper diagnosis was discovered, he was sent to the Suffolk Developmental Center nearer home. He was released in 1973."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/04/nyregion/notes-on-people-helping-the-deaf-talk-to-each-other-by-phone.html", "headline": "Notes on People; Helping the Deaf 'Talk to Each Other' by Phone", "date": "1982-01-04T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 4, 1982, Section B, Page 6Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The devices, connected to telephones, can ''talk to each other'' by sending and receiving messages.Dr. Levitt expects the portable telecommunicator to be available for about $200.

The appeals court based its ruling on the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which gives handicapped children the right to a ''free appropriate public education'' and requires school districts to prepare an ''individualized education program'' to accomplish that goal for every handicapped child.Because the case gives the Justices their first opportunity to define what Congress meant by the word ''appropriate,'' it has considerable nationwide significance.The school district, Hendrick Hudson Central School District in Peekskill, is arguing that ''appropriate education'' for a handicapped child is one that enables the child to become a ''functioning member of society.'' It opposed the requst for a signlanguage interpreter on the ground that the deaf child, Amy Rowley, was performing in the top half of her class without the special help and so was evidently receiving an ''appropriate education.'' Different View of 'Appropriate'The United States District Court in New York disagreed, interpreting ''appropriate'' as meaning that ''each handicapped child be given an opportunity to achieve his full potential.'' While Amy was adept at lip reading and received some help from a hearing aid, the court ruled that she was entitled to be able to understand everything said in the classroom, a goal that could be achieved only through sign language.The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the lower court's interpretation. The cost of a full-time sign language interpreter is from $20,000 to $25,000 a year. According to the New York State Commissioner of Educaton, who is supporting the district's appeal, the statewide cost of implementing the decision could be $100 million.That figure is somewhat open to doubt, however, because the appeals court explicitly limited its decision to the facts of the individual case. It was not brought as a class action and would not automatically apply to all deaf children.The Justice Department, asked by the Justices last spring for its views on the case, urged the Court not the take the school district's appeal, Board of Educaton v. Rowley, No. 80-1002. The department said that the lower courts were correct in interpreting ''appropriate'' to mean more than merely an ''adequate education for ''an interested and intellectually superior student like Amy Rowley.''Other actions at the Court today included these: Exclusionary RuleThe Court agreed to hear a criminal appeal from Alabama that, at least potentially, gives the Justices an opportunity to speak their minds on the exclusionary rule, which bars the admission at trial of illegally obtained evidence.The case, Taylor v. Alabama, No. 81-5152, is an appeal by a man who was arrested without a warrant and fingerprinted as a suspect in a robbery. The fingerprints matched prints at the scene and, confronted with that evidence, the man confessed to the crime.His lawyer argued that under the exclusionary rule, both the fingerprints and the confession, as products of the warrantless arrest, should be suppressed as evidence. The State Court of Criminal Appeals agreed and overturned the man's conviction.But the Alabama Supreme Court reversed that ruling and reinstated the conviction. The court called the exclusionary rule ''a crude, heavy-handed sanction of doubtful effectiveness'' and said the rule should not be used to suppress valid evidence like fingerprints. Women's CollegeThe Court agreed to hear an appeal by the Mississippi University for Women from a ruling by a Federal appeals court that as a stateoperated institution it is required by the Constitution to admit male students. That ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, led last summer to the admission of the first man in the school's 97-year history.In striking down the women-only policy, the appeals court ruled that the university had not shown that the policy was ''substantially related to important governmental objectives.'' That is the proof that the Supreme Court has required in order to justify sex discriminaton in other cases. The university's appeal, Miss. U. for Women v. Hogan, No. 81-406, argues that the test is too strict and that it should be sufficient to show that the admissions policy bears a ''rational relationship'' to the valid objective of educating women.The Court itself has shown signs of retreating from the stricter test, so today's case could prove significant for sex discrimination law in many other contexts. Mail Order MinistersThe Court refused to hear a challenge to a 1978 New York law that denied tax exemptions on property owned by members of the clergy unless the property was held in trust for the church. The law was enacted in response to a tax crisis in the Town of Hardenburgh, where 200 of the 236 residents became ministers of the Universal Life Church and received property tax exemptions on their private homes. The State Court of Appeals upheld the law last spring. (Hardenburgh v. New York, No. 81-226)"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/23/opinion/better-deaf-than-dumb-allies.html", "headline": "Better Deaf Than Dumb Allies", "date": "1981-07-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 23, 1981, Section A, Page 22Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Only a few months ago the French suggested that the seventh annual meeting in Ottawa be the last. But that meeting's only real decision was to start a new round of summit sessions in France next summer and to improve the year-round, lower-level consultations. They have never been more needed.Not in a generation have the industrial democracies been so badly divided, on political and military as well as economic issues. Yet their consultations fell off after changes of leadership in Washington and three other capitals. Surely the Reagan team now appreciates the need for better contacts, particularly about American economic policies, which heavily affect the allies.But nothing else seems to have been accomplished in Ottawa. The Americans climbed the summit primed more for public relations than for negotiation. They did extraordinarily well in getting their views to the news media. But the impression the allies took away was of ideological rigidity clothed in Presidential charm.As Treasury Secretary Regan revealed, it was a dialogue of the deaf. Recalling the President's refusal to budge on high American interest rates -which keep the Europeans on recession's rack - the Secretary said the other leaders ''recognized his strength and determination, and there was dead silence.''But the silence has not lasted long. Responding to American assertions that the Reagan policies will reduce inflation and bring interest rates down, the president of the European Commission, Gaston Thorn, said: ''Hurry up. We can't wait too long.'' Chancellor Schmidt said he would immediately have to tighten West Germany's austerity belt and cutGovernment spending - without saying whether he would cut the defense programs the United States wants increased. President Mitterrand of France said it would be ''intolerable'' if high interest rates and depressed currencies continued beyond the end of the year. With 24 million unemployed in the industrial countries, including 20 percent of Europe's youth, he warned of an approaching ''flash point'' that could catalyze social upheaval. There was general criticism also of America's refusal to contemplate more economic aid for the third world - even for developing new energy sources for everyone's benefit.The allies believe that more moderate tax cuts and some deflation in the United States would permit a measure of recovery in Europe and the third world and thus contribute to a later American upturn. Mr. Reagan's deep tax cuts, they fear, will not be adequately offset by tight money and high interest rates. And the persisting recession in both the industrial and developing countries, they warn, will only hinder American foreign and military policies.They contend that economic crisis and political instability in the developing countries will only open new opportunities for Soviet adventure. Economic weakness in Europe, they insist, will injure Western defenses and add to the social discontent that breeds neutralism.When expressed in diplomatic cables, these fears are easily dismissed by an Administration focused on domestic concerns. But they cannot fail to make an impression in face-to-face talks. Ottawa gave no guarantee of better allied coordination. But without summits and the foothill consultations that surround them, the chances would be bleaker still."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/18/business/advertising-kenyon-eckhardt-aids-deafness-research-group.html", "headline": "Advertising; KENYON & ECKHARDT AIDS DEAFNESS RESEARCH GROUP", "date": "1981-06-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 18, 1981, Section D, Page 18Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Morrissey, chairman of the agency, to New York from his Detroit office yesterday with three television commercials, two radio commercials and a print ad.The theme: ''Help us help them. They can't hear you.''Louise Fletcher, the actress, appears in the TV and radio spots. When she accepted an Oscar for her role as the icy nurse in ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' she emotionally told the TV audience about her deaf parents.Mr. Morrissey was joined at the K.&E. office in New York by Albert J. Levine, the foundation's director of development. ''This is the first effort to really bring the problem of deafness to the general public,'' Mr. Levine said. There are two million totally deaf people in this country, he said, and 14 million more with hearing problems.He noted that no deafness organization appeared on a list of the 22 health-related groups that were most successful in raising funds. In the past, he said, the Deafness Research Foundation has gotten 90 percent of its help from foundations and corporations - ''the exact reverse of other organizations'' - and has raised only about $500,000. Other organizations with public support generally pull in nine-figure totals.George L. Ball, president of E.F. Hutton & Company, is chairman of the deafness foundation.

Step, kick, arms to the right, arms to the left. The entire auditorium is throbbing to the beat.The teen-aged performers are right in step. Back, back, stay. Turn. Back, back, stay. This might be a feat under ordinary circumstances, but these circumstances are not ordinary. None of the performers can hear the music: They are all profoundly deaf.They are students at the Lexington School for the Deaf, in their final rehearsal for their third annual dance recital. Performances will be given at the large, modern private school in Jackson Heights, Queens, on Friday and Saturday.''For years we believed that dance was not a viable activity for deaf people,'' said Oscar P. Cohen, the school principal and administrative producer of the show. ''What we've learned is that it's a marvelous way for kids to feel good about themselves.''Most of the students have been deaf since birth, some through heredity and many because their mothers were victims of rubella epidemics in 1963 and 1964 when they were pregnant. Other students lost their hearing because of accidents, spinal meningitis or early childhood diseases.Nonetheless they can hear some sound. Mr. Cohen talks of one deaf person who could stand in front of a car blasting its horn and not hear it at all - but who could hear certain bird songs. Harry Groveman, the director of the show, tells of a deaf student who loved to listen to chamber music because he could hear the harp and the flute.All the students in the performance wear hearing aids, which amplify what little hearing they have. In fact, before the start of the show, they all test their hearing aids, looking and sounding just like members of an orchestra tuning up. ''Bah, Bah, Bah,'' they say, scowling attentively as they listen to hear their own words and adjust their hearing aids accordingly.Two loudspeakers are on the stage, amplifying the sound, and the students have all learned the steps by counting. One, two, three, step. One, two, three. During each performance, Mr. Groveman stands in a prompter's box in front of the stage, counting with his fingers, conducting, signaling, giving the beat and keeping everyone together. There are two other prompters in the wings, counting with their fingers for the actors to see. The students also feel the beat of the music through the vibrations of the wooden stage. Complexity Added to ShowMr. Groveman, the school's physical education teacher and wrestling coach, was the first to suggest that students could pull off such a recital. The idea was accepted tentatively, but the first recital two years ago was such a success that it was repeated again last year with more difficult numbers. This year tap dancing was added, even though the students cannot hear themselves tap.There are no tryouts. Everyone is accepted. Because Mr. Groveman is such a popular teacher, the show has even drawn members of the wrestling team who managed to abandon the idea that dance was only for sissies. Several of the wrestlers are outstanding dancers.The show is entitled ''Apple Pie,'' and it is about New York - its ethnicity, its excitement, its past and, above all, its difficulties. The show is about obstacles overcome and survival, and the students who helped to create it, Mr. Cohen says, saw it as a metaphor of their own lives.There are touching moments that purposely draw their poignancy from the fact that the performers cannot hear. In one scene, entitled ''Washington Square,'' four street musicians saunter off, leaving a small xylophone behind. A puzzled passer-by picks it up and takes it to the front of the stage. He puts it on the prompter's box, examines it curiously, and, giving the audience a sly smile, slowly and laboriously picks out ''I Love New York'' - which he, of course, cannot hear.It is a moment to bring down the house."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/03/style/science-watch-telephones-for-the-deaf.html", "headline": "Telephones for the Deaf", "date": "1981-03-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 3, 1981, Section C, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

In fact, it's worse.\u201d\u201cI made more money during the strike as a carpenter than I will now at school, \"said Edward Grossman, whose annual salary is $13,900, adding that he was not certain whether he would be able to support his family after his wife has their first child. \u201cIt is just outrageous,\u201d he said.Source of Salary IncreasesThe teachers, whose contract expired last September, struck Oct. 2 after negotiations broke down over salaries. At issue was whether the school, a private institution that receives state funds, should augment staff salaries with private money.The teachers, who are paid by the state, receive from $7,044 a year for an instructional assistant to $18,500 for a teacher with 20 years of experience. They contend that the salaries are more than 20 percent under those received by teachers of the deaf in New York City public schools. The public school teachers earn between $10,141 and $25,491.Under the latest agreement, the board of trustees at the 112\u2010year\u2010old internationally acclaimed School, at 75th Street and 30th Avenue in Jackson Heights, will pay a 7 percent wage increase and a $500 increase for certain teachers until the additional salary can be reimbursed by the state. While the school management has agreed that its faculty deserves higher wages, it maintains that it is up to the state to pay them.\u201cHearing children are educated at public expense,\u201d said Oscar Cohen, educational director at the school and a spokesman for the board of trustees. \u201cWhy should deaf children be different? It is the state's responsibility to provide for adequate salary reimbursement. The salary reimbursements are not adequate now.\u201dThe state, which annually awards $3 million to the school, bases salaries for it and 11 other private state\u2010financed schools for the deaf and blind on the wages paid to teachers at a school for the deaf in Rome, N.Y. That school is the only one for the deaf in the state that is owned and operated by the state, and has traditionally served as a model for the other institutions for the deaf, which are managed privately.The teachers contend that upstate wages are inadequate to meet the expenses of New York City and that if the state cannot pay them additional funds, the school should. The school has refused to disclose its private holdings and has said that, in any event, its private funds have been earmarked for other purposes.In an attempt to help settle the dispute, parents of youngsters at the school met last week with Governor Carey. He is reported by the parents to have said that 60 days after a contract is negotiated in January with other professional employees of the state, he would look into a reclassification of the teachers at the school In Rome.\u201cWe can't afford to teach here, \"said Barbara Perkins, who has been at the school four years, earns $12,400 and waits on tables to supplement her income."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/10/archives/deafschool-strike-backed-by-parents-they-and-students-join-pickets.html", "headline": "DEAF\u2010SCHOOL STRIKE BACKED BY PARENTS", "date": "1979-10-10T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 10, 1979, Section A, Page 25Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Both sides have been summoned to appear this morning before the New York State Mediation Board at the World Trade Center.\u201cIt takes money to live in New York,\u201d said Elroy Blake, whose 16\u2010year\u2010old daughter attends the school and had come from the Bronx to show his support. \u201cThe state doesn't want to give it. The school doesn't want to give it. And these teachers deserve it.\u201dSalaries Paid by StateThe key issue is whether the school \u2014 a private, nonprofit institution subsidized by the state and Federal governments that caters to deaf youngsters from infancy through high school \u2014 should augment staff salaries with private funds. The salaries, which are paid by the state, range from $7,044 a year for an instructional assistant to $18,500 for a teacher with 20 years\u2019 experience. The teachers\u2019 contract expired Sept. 28.The state, which annually awards $3 million to the 112\u2010year old school, bases salaries for it and 11 other private schools for the deaf it subsidizes on those wages paid to teachers at a state\u2010owned school in Rome, N.Y.The teachers contend that upstate wages are inadequate to meet expenses here and that if the state cannot pay them additional funds, the school should through its private endowment. Through a spokesman, the school refused yesterday to disclose the extent of its holdings. In any event, the spokesman said, this money has been earmarked by the school's board of trustees for other purposes.\u201cIt is the board's position that it is the state's responsibility to educate deaf children,\u201d said Oscar Cohen, the school's educational director, \u201cand that it would prove adverse to the operation of the school in the long run to have a different posture.\u201dThe school is internationally known for its \u201coral\u201d approach to deafness in which youngsters are encouraged to utilize the hearing they do have and learn to speak.For 11 years the school has been at a $9 million, 7.5\u2010acre campus at 75th Street and 30th Avenue in Jackson Heights. The name derives from the school's previous location, at Lexington Avenue and 68th Street."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/06/archives/nonspeaking-deaf-man-caught-in-legal-net-on-murder-charge-to-study.html", "headline": "Nonspeaking Deaf Man Caught In Legal Net on Murder Charge", "date": "1979-08-06T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 6, 1979, Section A, Page 15Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

He neither reads nor writes, and he uses broad pantomime to communicate with his family.\u201cHe didn't know the word law or the words lawyer, court, courtroom, judge, trial, anything to do with the legal proceeding in which he has found himself involved, \u201c said Ann Phillips, assistant director of the Deaf Action Center of Dallas, who served as a court\u2010appointed interpreter at the hearing.\u201cHe did not understand until the hear. ings he was being charged with murder. I think he understands that now.\u201dTo Study Sign LanguageOn Tuesday Mr. Fisher wept in frustration as District Judge James Zimmermann tried for more than 20 minutes to explain the murder charged to him at a pretrial hearing. The next day his bond was reduced to $5,000 from $25,000. His family posted the bond, allowing him to be released to begin the intensive study in sign language he will need if he goes to court.Grand jury proceedings are set for Aug. 21 to determine whether he will be indicted on the murder charges. If he is indicted, lawyers said, it will probably be a year before he will be competent to stand trial.The case has attracted a good deal of attention here partly because of striking similarities to a well publicized Chicago murder trial involving a deaf man.In May, CBS\u2010TV aired \u201cDummy,\u201d a made-for-television movie about Donald Lang, a nonspeaking deaf Chicagoan who was accused of killing prostitutes in 1965 and 1970 but was released when the courts ruled that he was unable to understand the charges or assist in his defense.IliKe Mr. Lang who has been in prisonsince November 1977, Mr. Fisher is black and poor. But his court\u2010appointed attorney, Scott Anderson, said he was hopeful that Mr. Fisher would learn enough sign language to be able to receive a fair trial.`A Quick Learner\u2019\u201cThe average deaf person hasn't been sheltered the way Jerome has,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cWhen I first met him, don't think he understood why he was in jail. But Jerome is very alert, he's quick learner, and I'm hoping that with proper training, he'll be able to pick up the communications skills he needs to assist in his defense.\u201dMr. Fisher is not a shut\u2010in. He plays basketball with his neighbors, rides city buses and spends much of his time watching sports events on television or playing cards or dominoes with relatives or neighbors.His sister, Lillian Mills, with whom he lives, insists he was at home asleep at the time of the killing.\u201cI know he was at home, and if he could I 'speak I'm sure he could tell them that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as for how this is affecting him, I really couldn't say. I'd have to pay more attention to know what he's thinking.\u201dBut the Dallas police said Mr. Fisher was well known by several Dallas prostitutes, and the hotel clerk has identified him as the man who checked into the hotel room where the prostitute was found dead."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/12/archives/deaf-student-loses-high-court-appeal-justices-rule-rehabilitation.html", "headline": "DEAF STUDENT LOSES HIGH COURT APPEAL", "date": "1979-06-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 12, 1979, Section A, Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

It is a setback for both the Federal Government and for the recently organized groups of handicapped individuals whose efforts culminated in passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.In another case the Court agreed today to decide if New York State's latest attempt to provide state aid to parochial schools is constitutional. [Page B1.1The Justices unanimously overturned the obscenity conviction of an adult 15ook store owner in New Hampton, Orange County, N.Y., because of an \u201copenended\u201d warrant that the High Court said led to an unconstitutional search of the store. [Page D19.]The decision on the handicapped student, Southeastern Community College v. Davis (No. 78\u2010711), reverses a ruling of a Federal appeals court, which held that the North Carolina college could not refuse to admit a deaf woman to its nursing program solely because of her handicap. The lower court had further indicated that the college was obliged to give the woman, Frances B. Davis, special help to compensate for her disability.At issue in the case was Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which provides \u2018 that \u201cno otherwise qualified handicapped individual\u201d can be excluded \u201csolely by reason of his handicap\u201d from participation in any program receiving Federal funds.The trial court, interpreting this language to apply to persons who would be qualified \u201cin spite of the handicap,\u201d ruled in favor of the college. Mrs. Davis was not an \u201cotherwise qualified handicapped individual,\u201d the court said, because her dependence on lip\u2010reading would prevent her from functioning \u201csufficiently\u201d as a nursing student or registered nurse.The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, ruling that Section 504 requires an institution to examine an applicant's qualifications without regard to any handicap. Further, the court said, Section 504 requires \u201caffirmative conduct\u201d to enable the handicapped to participate fully\u201d even when such modifications become expensive.\u201dOpinion by Justice PowellThe Supreme Court, in an opinion\u2010by Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., agreed with the trial court. \u201cAn otherwise qualified person is one who is able to meet all of a program's requirements in spite of his handicap,\u201d the opinion said.The physical qualifications, Justice Powell said, had to be legitimate ones. In this case, he said, \u201cit is not open to dispute that, as Southeastern's associate degree nursing program currently is constituted, the ability to understand speech without reliance on lip reading is necessary for patient safety.\u201dThe High Court also rejected the second part of the appeals court's conclusion.\u201cNeither the language, purpose, nor history of Section 504 reveals an intent to impose an affirmative action obligation on all recipients of Federal funds,\u201d Justice Powell wrote.\u201cIt is undisputed,\u201d he said, that Mrs. Davis \u201ccould not participate in Southeastern's nursing program unless the standards were substantially lowered. Section 509 imposes no requirement upon an educational institution to lower or to affect substantial modifications of standards to accomodate a handicapped person.\u201dDoubts About the RulingDespite this apparently unambiguous language, however, other portions of opinion leave open to question exactly how sweeping today's ruling is.Justice Powell left open the possibility that, when modifications to accomodate the handicapped can be made \u201cwithout imposing undue financial and administrative burdens,\u201d there would be situations \u201cwhere a refusal to modify an existing program might become unreasonable and discriminatory.\u201d\u201cWe do not suggest,\u201d the opinion said, \u201cthat the line between a lawful refusal to extend affirmativeactitn and illegal dis erimination against handicapped persons always will be clear.\u201dJustice Powell said that the drawing of such a line \u201ccontinues to be an important responsibility\u201d of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The department administers the law and has issued regulations requiring educational institutions to provide \u201cauxiliary aids\u201d for handicapped students.There is also language in the opinion suggesting that today's holding can be confined to professional training programs with particular physical requirements, as opposed to general liberal arts programs. The opinion also appears to apply only to educational institutions, rather than to the array of social services also covered by Section 509. The 15\u2010page opinion was unusually short for such a relatively unexplored subject.Associated PressFrances B.

A coalition of deaf persons and organizations of the handicapped, protesting the lack of captions, started a boycott that forced the film to close after only a one\u2010week run.M\u2010G\u2010M says it was first commercial run of a feature subtitled especially for deaf.The coalition also charged that the film exploited the deaf because the lead role was not played by a deaf woman and her role was a stereotype. The heroine was played by the actress Amy Irving, who is not deaf.\u201cWe had distributed over 20,000 leaflets in this area,\u201d said the boycott leader, Albert Walla, an employee of the Deaf Counseling, Advocacy and Referral Agency in Oakland. \u201cWhen the captioned version came out last week, it was too late.\u201d\u201cBesides, it was a lousy movie,\u201d said Mr. Walla, who is deaf. \u201cDeaf people don't like to see movies where they are portrayed as unable to survive without the support and love of a hearing person.\u201dMr. Walla charged that M\u2010G\u2010M had \u201cput captions on just to quiet us down.\u201d But Mr. Newman said that the captioned print of \u201cVoices,\u201d which cost an extra $30,000 to produce, had been \u201cin the works since late January.\u201d\u201cWe did everything we could to make it a movie for deaf people,\u201d he said. \u201cIn truth, we went to all ends to find a qualified deaf actress for the role and we could not. We hired Martin Sternberg, a deaf professor at New York University, as a technical adviser. And there were a number of deaf people who acted in the movie.\u201dMr. Newman added that M\u2010G\u2010M had given private showings of the captioned print to deaf groups in Tucson, San Diego, Minneapolis, New York and Washington. \u201cOnly in San Francisco have we had trouble,\u201d he said, \u201cand even there we had the support and praise of the Hearing Society of the Bay Area.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/22/archives/device-to-let-deaf-read-tv-speech-financed-by-us.html", "headline": "Device to Let Deaf \u2018Read\u2019 TV Speech", "date": "1979-03-22T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 22, 1979, Section C, Page 23Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

In this case, she (Amy Irving) is a deaf teacher who'd like to dance, although other recent variations on this theme have dealt with a blind ice skater who'd like to become a champion (Lynn-Holly Johnson in \"Ice Castles\") and an about-to-be-crippled ballerina who hopes to give one last great performance (Anne Ditchburn in \"Slow Dancing in the Big City\").In each of these movies \u2014 and \"Voices,\" which opens today at the Baronet, is about the best of a very lackluster bunch \u2014 the situation takes the place of a plot. His optimism and her infirmity are the only well-established signs of character, and the action creeps inexorably toward a happy ending that is at least as tired as it is triumphant. \"Voices\" is full of details about the young man, played by Michael Ontkean, and his family (three generations of contentious men) and their house (in Hoboken) and their business (dry cleaning). But it all manages to seem either trumped-up or extraneous, as does the fact that he has a dream, too. (He wants to be a rock singer.)Movies in this mold tend to be so preoccupied with pie-in-the-sky that they scant the everyday activities that might hold an audience's attention. (Perhaps the most powerful surprise in \"Coming Home\" was its matter-of-fact depiction of how a paraplegic might accomplish simple household or hygienic chores.)\"Voices\" includes one very effective scene of Miss Irving conducting a telephone conversation \u2014 using a kind of typewriter keyboard \u2014 with a deaf friend, and it devotes some attention to sign language. But the director, Robert Markowitz, is so poorly equipped to render his deaf heroine's experience inventively that the best he can do is simply shut off the soundtrack from time to time. The screenplay, by John Herzfeld, is equally insensitive, particularly when it means to be funny. Someone in hero's family: \"Is she deaf and dumb?\" Hero: \"She is not dumb. She's smarter than all of us. She's a teacher.\"Mr. Ontkean is considerably more likable than his material. But the character is so nebulous \u2014 and so noisy and frantic, as a clumsy counterpoint to the silent, demure heroine \u2014 that his performance never takes shape; \"Slap Shot,\" in which he was cast as a funny, disillusioned hockey player, provided a much better indication of what he can do.Miss Irving's role is just as ill-defined, but she is agile and interesting even when the screenplay merely calls for her to look shy. And in the last part of the film, when a frustrated and embarrassed Miss Irving \u2014 who has made a dramatically convenient secret of her deafness \u2014 auditions with a dance company, though she can't hear the music or the directions, she is given a welcome opportunity to be something other than an ing\u00e9nue. She has an appealing uneasiness that might work better in less sugary roles.Alex Rocco, Herbert Berghof, Viveca Lindfors and the city of Hoboken also appear in the film, although only Hoboken accomplishes this with any success. Mr. Markowitz has also recruited some emphatically disagreeable bit players (one of them throws his false teeth on a table, to emphasize something he has been hollering about).And the script, which is mysteriously full of references to meat, is also overloaded with unlikely coincidences. Mr. Ontkean first spies Miss Irving, for instance, in a train station where she has been playing with one of those machines that engrave a name on a little good-luck charm, and tracks her down after she leaves the charm behind. Speaking of unlikely, her name is Rosemarie Lemon.\"Voices\" is rated PG (\"Parental Guidance Suggested\"). It includes one very mild love scene and a little bit of angry language.They Shall OvercomeVOICES, directed by Robert Markowitz; written by John Herzfeld; director of photography, Alan Metzger; edited by Danford B. Greene; music by Jimmy Webb; produced by Joe Wizan; released by United Artists. At the Baronet Theater, Third Avenue near 59th Street. Running time: 107 minutes.

School for the Blind in Winnetka, Ill., died Monday of a heart attack at Eyanston Hospital in Evanston. Ill. Mr. Kinney, a resident of Winnetka. was 55 years old.He was the third blind and deaf person to graduate from an American university, after Helen Keller and \u2018Robert Smithdas.Born in East Sparta, Ohio, on June 21, 1923, Mr. Kinney began life as a normal child but, for reasons that have never been fully understood, lost his sight at the age of 7, after completing the first grade.He spent the next four years quietly at home. \u201cRest, radio and my parents\u2019 reading were my three R's at this time,\u201d he observed later. In 1934 he entered the Braille class at the Waring School in Cleveland, where he passed grades two, three, four and five in a single winter.Hearing Began to FailAlthough his hearing had already begun to fail, he re\u2010entered the East Sparta School at the age of 12. His parents read his lessons to him in the evenings, and he did his written work on a portable typewriter bought from a door-to-door salesman.The next fall Mr. Kinney entered Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, relying on a powerful hearing aid to augment his hearing. Active in campus life, he became a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and served as poetry editor of the college newspaper. In January 1944 he became totally deaf and returned to his home in East Sparta.It was not until seven years later that Mr. Kinney was able to return to college. By that time he had heard of a student named Robert Smithdas who had attended St. John's University in Brooklyn by listening through his hands.Like Mr. Smithdas, he found companions who could help, accompanying him to lectures and using his hand as a sort of typewriter \u2014 a knuckle for one letter, a fingertip for another \u2014 reading hiin everything that he could not find in Braille.To continue his education, he enrolled in home\u2010study courses with the Hadley School for the Blind, where his instructors recognized his exceptional promise and urged him to attempt to return to college. With the help of a Helen Keller Scholarship and the Ohio Rehabilitation Service, he returned to Mount Union in 1951 and in June of 1954, graduated summa cum laude. Again he was valedictorian of his class.lie later became an instructor at the Hadley school, where he moved up gradually in administration to become president in 1975. He was also chairman of the committee on services to the deaf\u2010blind of the Paris\u2010based World Council for the Welfare of the Blind.On June 16, 1962, he married a blind teacher. Evelyn Davis Warmbrodt, who died in 1966.Mr. Kinney received two honorary doctorates, one from Mount Union College in 1966 and the other from Loyola University in 1977. He was a recipient of the Helen Keller gold medal for literary excellence, the Man of the Year award for the National Home Study Council in 1978 and the Francis Joseph Campbell award from the American LibraryHe is survived by a son, Clark, 15, and a sister, Rosemary of St. Paul, Minn.A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M. today at the Hadley School.Associated Press, 1860Richard Kinney"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/06/archives/cities-once-deaf-to-rock-turn-on-to-concert-revenues-concerts-real.html", "headline": "Cities, Once Deaf to Rock, Turn On to Concert Revenues", "date": "1979-02-06T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 6, 1979, Section A, Page 12Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

An estimated $50,000 worth of property was destroyed and 150 people were arrested after the rock group Sly and the Family Stone failed to show up fora free outdoor concert.\u201cThere was an understanding after the incident that we would not book rock concerts,\u201d said a spokesman for the Chicago Park District, which runs the city's outdoor facilities. \u201cBut two years ago we were in dire need of money and our Board of Commissioners decided to set up a series of rock concerts as a test. We were very pleased with the results.\u201dConcerts \u2018Real Moneymakers\u2019\u201cWe made several hundred thousand dollars from the concerts and there was very minimal property damage,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cRock concerts are real moneymakers.\u201dThe city receives 12 percent of all gate receipts from concerts at its facilities, about $30,000 more from parking fees and 15 percent of concession revenues. A 3 percent entertainment tax is charged at facilities that the city does not own.\u201cFor a while the promoters were afraid to try to book big concerts because they were held totally liable if anyone got hurt,\u201d said Arny Granat, a partner of Jam Productions, a major promotion concern here.\u201cThe trend,\u201d he said, \u201chas been toward the smaller, more intimate houses seating between 4,000 and 6,000 persons where security is easier.\u201d Spectators are required to submit to a search for weapons, bottles and large quantities of drugs before they can enter the concert facilities, Mr. Granat said.Although Miami did not ban rock concerts, the city did institute a highly restrictive booking policy for its facilities after a performance by a rock group called the Doors.Miami also began using what has become a sophisticated national communications network that allows managers of city facilities to exchange information on rock groups before bookings are made.Richard Roach, assistant director of Stadiums and Marinas in Miami, said that anyone who wants to use city facilities for a rock concert now has to fill out an approval form. \u201cWe send the information to the Police Department and they run their check,\u201d he said.Miami has three major indoor halls that book rock concerts, with capacities ranging from 1,800 to 18,000. But large outdoor rock concerts are held at the Miami baseball stadium, which has a capacity of 30,000.Mr. Roach said the city gets 10 percent of the gross receipts of a concert at the baseball stadium. The city recently took in $26,000 from a concert by Jimmy Buffet that drew more than 25,000 spectators. \u201cThe city is very open to rock right now and even the Orange Bowl is not off limits if someone can come up with acts that will draw the 60,000 people needed to fill it,\u201d Mr. Roach said.In New York City, there has never been a strong movement to ban or restrict rock concerts, although some effort has been made to reduce the size of larger outdoor productions, according to Gordon J. Davis, the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation.The city negotiates each event separately, receiving a varying percentage of the gross revenues. For example, last year the city received 17 percent of the gate receipts from a concert series at the Woilman Rink in Central Park, taking in$147,000. When the concerts are free the city gets nothing.Ron Delsener, a major rock amcert producer in the New York area, said he had never had any trouble from the city. \u201cUnlike other places, you can do anything you want here,\u201d he said.In Houston. there are now about three times as many rock concerts as there were 10 years ago. Rock and other popular shows account for about 50 percent of the Civic Center's income, according to its director, Jerry Lowery. The Civic Center houses the 12,000\u2010seat Coliseum and a 3,000\u2010seat music hall.Charging only 1 percent of gross receipts as rent, the city facilities may be the biggest bargain in town, he said. The city plans to spend about $16 million to renovate the center and make it more at.: tractive.In the late 1960's Los Angeles passed a law discouraging outdoor concerts with amplified music and instituted a tough stance on drug use. Strain between rock fans and the city was exacerbated in 1975 when 511 people were arrested by the police during a five\u2010day concert by the group Pink Floyd at the 15,000\u2010seat sports arena.As a result, the larger and more successful concerts moved to facilities outside the city where they continue to be held today.Rock concerts have never been banned in Knoxville or Johnson City, Tenn., but spectators in both cities have been searched before being admitted to concerts. The policy was discontinued in Knoxville last year but continues in Johnson City.\u201cWe have about 26 rock shows per year, about the same number of shows we had four years ago, and they account for about 25 percent to 30 percent of our income.\u201d said Fred McCallum, manager of the Civic Coliseum in Knoxville, \u201cIn 1978 our income was $1,014,361.\u201dIn Buffalo, N.Y., four facilities are competing for rock concerts because of their large profits. When the Rolling Stones played before an audience of 70,000 at the Rich Stadium in the Orchard Park suburb of Buffalo, Erie County received $90,000 in sales\u2010tax revenues alone. And Buffalo's 17,000\u2010seat Memorial Auditorium has made about $500,000 on rentals for rock concerts in the last eight years.In Seattle, where rock concerts flourished while other cities experienced trouble with them, such shows now gross about $5 million a year and account for about $125,000 of the $270 million the city received in admission taxes on entertainment and sporting events last year.1 he New York TimesRock concerts, once shunned at city\u2010owned facilities for the destruction they sometimes caused, are now being courted in many cities because of the revenues they bring. Such concerts are a multimillion dollar industry."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/26/archives/syracuse-fights-to-keep-deaf-pupils-in-program-no-specialservice.html", "headline": "Syracuse Fights to Keep Deaf Pupils in Program", "date": "1978-12-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 26, 1978, Section B, Page 2Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The words are English. The structure of the language is not.The question is in Ameslan, American Sign Language, the language of the deaf. It might be translated, \u201cAre we going outside or not?\u201dWhen a deaf youngster signs \u201cyesterdaiy soccer me Bruce,\u201d using his hands, the sentence structure does not prevent those who read signs from understanding that the child played soccer with Bruce the day before. The structure does, however, make it especially difficult for him to learn to read, write and speak grammatical English. The learning requires special education.The prograni for deaf children operating within the Stone Hedge Elementary School, a public \u201chearing\u201d school here, provides that education, and the program is considered one of the best in the country.\u2018No Special\u2010Senriee Aid\u2019But the city school district of Syracuse, about five miles east of here, is having to t to keep deaf city youngsters a part it. The obstacle is a financial provision of state education law. The law prevents the state's five largest cities from seeking aid for educational services outside of the cities. Thomas Clift, the director of special education for the Syracuse school district, said, \u201cAccording to state\u2010education law, city school districts in the internal \u2018Big Five\u2019 cities are not allowed to seek Federal reimbursement for contracted educational services,\u201d such as those provided by the Stone Hedge program, the Onondaga County Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) School. The five cities are New York, Yonkers, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.\u201cWe can get no special\u2010service aid or excess\u2010cost aid\u201d or regular state aid for the deaf students, Mr. Clift said. The district, now in financial straits like many others statewide, cannot afford the deafschool program without the aid, he said. For the 11 city school district pupils enrolled in the program, the total yearly bill comes to about $72,000.Mr. Clift said district officials were preparing an amendment to the education law that they hoped to see introduced in the State Legislature early in 1979.If the variance is not approved, the city's other option is to remove its students from the BOCES program and provide services for them within the city school district. The district would then be eligible for aid, and city costs for the youngsters\u2019 schooling would be less.But many officials believe that this option would force staff cuts in the program, which Dr. Hugh T. Prickett, director of teacher education at Western Maryland College, which is nationally known for training teachers of the deaf, called \u201cthe best mainstream program I've seen in anywhere in the country.\u201dIn addition, removal of the city youngsters \u201cwould splinter the deaf population of the region,\u201d Marlee Nicholas, supervisor of the program, said. \u201cIt would destroy that part of the children's lives.\u201d\u2018Total Communication\u2019 TaughtStudents in the program commute to Camillus daily from as far away as Cortland, Auburn and Port Byron. Removal of the city youngsters would reduce the deaf\u2010student population by 25 percent. Of 29 elementary students, seven are from Syracuse. Four of the 17 students at junior and senior high\u2010school levels are city residents.Education of the children involves what teachers call \u201ctotal communication\u201d \u2014 finger\u2010spelling, speech (lip) reading, gestures, auditory training, signing, reading and writing, all in the context of English grammar. In conversation, teachers and students use what they call \u201cSiglish,\u201d a minor variation of highly stnictured signed English.For studies other than language, many of the deaf children are assigned to regular classes far hearing students in the school. Most deaf youngsters, accompanied by \u201cinterpretutors,\u201d join hearing children in classes in physical education, art, home economics, industrial arts and typing.As of the fall of 1977, the deaf\u2010student population of Syracuse totaled 33, with 14 in state schools for the deaf, nine in private institutions and 10 that year in the BOCES program. In 1977, deaf\u2010student populations in the other Big Five cities totaled 26 in Yonkers, 75 in Buffalo, 100 in Rochester and 1,743 in New York City, according to the State Information Center on Education."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/20/archives/religious-leader-from-iran-says-torture-made-him-nearly-deaf.html", "headline": "Religious Leader From Iran Says Torture Made Him Nearly Deaf", "date": "1978-12-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 20, 1978, Section A, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The couple could not refute the charges because they were not represented by a law yer and did not comprehend what was being said in court.Several months later, the couple went to the Southern California Center for Law and the Deaf. Lawyers there made clear in court that the mother was an excellent parent and that all the child needed was training in sign language so that she could better communicate with her parents. Today the family is reunited and the child is doing well in school.\u2018Our center exists to break down the isolation of the deaf.\u2019The custody case was just one of 300 dr?? crimination matters handled by the cent?? since it came into being at the start of the year. Although there are centers in Philadelphia and Washington. D. C., that provide social services for the deaf, the Los Angeles center is the only one in the nation designed to help the deaf overcome legal barriers.\u201cIt is easy to discriminate against the deaf because they are not as visible as other handicapped and minority persons,\u201d said Shelley Paltri, project director and one of four lawyers on the staff. \u201cIf you see a person in a wheelchair, you know that they will need a ramp in order to get into a courthouse; but if you see a hard\u2010of\u2010hearing person, you don't realize that the courthouse should have acoustical tile so that he can use his hearing aid to best advantage. People realize that Spanishspeaking persons need interpreters in court, but they don't realize that the deaf do, too.\u201dThe center has handled a wide variety of discriminalion cases, many of which are set??ed out of court.One of its first involved a deaf man who had taught his cat to signal him when someone came to the door. The apartment budding where the man lived had a no\u2010pet policy. The tenant thought that he might be evicted be cause, all hough thi, law provided that a blind person with a Seeing Eye dog could not be discriminated against. in housing, there was no provision for the deaf who use cats. Instead of filing suit, a lawyer from the center sat down with the landlord and persuaded him to allow the deaf man to remain.Three\u2010fourths of the center's legal cases involve job discrimination.\u201cDeaf people put up with blatant forms of discrimination because they are terrified of losing their jobs and jeopardizing their futures,\u201d said Rokki B. Knee, a former senior staff attorney with the law center. \u201cThe deaf are not politically sophisticated and don't know where to complain.\u201dInterpreter Was BarredCenter lawyers have been working with deaf members of a Los Angeles local of the international Typographers Union whose bylaws provide that only members of the union can be present at union meetings. Because of this provision, a sign\u2010language interpreter has been barred, and the deaf, who make up 10 percent of the membership, have had almost no way of finding out about contract negotiations, grievances and other union business. The center intends to file suit contending that the union's bylaws have created a second\u2010class membership for the deaf.Several deaf teachers faced layoffs this i,:ummer because of Proposition 13, California's controversial tax initiative that slashed revenue to local government by 60 percent. The teachers were afraid that programs for deaf children would be eliminated and that they would be dismissed because they lacked the seniority of teachers, who could hear. However, an administrative law judge accepted the center's arguments that the programs were too vital to be eliminated and that the deaf teachers should be retained because it is important for deaf children to have deaf teachers as role models.Some of the Problems\u201cOur center exists to break down the isolation of the deaf,\u201d said Katherine McDuglad, community education coordinator. \u201cLife can be a big hassle for them.\u201dShe cited these examples:Stores sometimes do not have their policies for return of merchandise, gift wrapping, and mailing prominently displayed so that the deaf person is left confused.Police officers frequently misinterpret the actions of the deaf. They think the deaf are reaching for a gun or knife when in fact all they are trying to do is to get a pad and pencil out of their pockets so that they can communicate with the officer.Courts have been slow in recognizing the rights of the deaf. Although the deaf have the right to an interpreter in juvenile and criminal matters in California, they do not yet have the right to such representation in civil suits. Deaf persons are barred from serving on ??uries although there are suits pending on ??asissue.Few hospitals or large corporations have sign language interpreters or teletypewriters, devices that enable the deaf to communicate by typing messages on a keyboard and trans mitting them over telephone lines. The deaf need sign language interpreters because of the limitations of lip reading. Only 35 percent of what is said on the lips can be lip\u2010read by the deaf. Teletypewriters enable the deaf to inform others when they are ill and unable to work.\u201cThere is still a lot of work to be done be cause California has about two million deaf persons.\u201d Miss Palm said.The center does not charge fees for its all legal work. It is supported by the Greater Los Angeles Council on Deafness, a group of 35 organizations for the deaf that receives funds under CETA, the Federal Comprehensive Training and Education Act, and also gets state allocations and private foundation grants.One of the center's biggest projects has been to try to persuade television stations in Los Angeles to caption their news for the deaf. The stations have resisted because they contend that captions are distracting for persons who can hear.\u2018Why Not the Local News?\u2019\u201cI think that position is ridiculous because millions of Americans go to see foreign language films with captions.\u201d said Miss Knee. \u201cIf they can enjoy a Bergman film with captions, why not the local news.\u201dThe center also works with businesses to develop job programs for the deaf. The Bank of America. for example, is developing a program in which the job of the teller is divided. The deaf person does the bookkeeping and the person who can hear communicates with the customer.\u201cI am optimistic that life will improve for the deaf,\u201d said Miss Palm, \u201cbecause legislators and other public officials are becoming increasingly aware of the communication problems of the deaf.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/23/archives/gibson-is-called-deaf-to-pleas-on-police-vigilante-action-feared.html", "headline": "Gibson Is Called Deaf to Pleas on Police", "date": "1978-11-23T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from November 23, 1978, Section B, Page 11Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Gibson was determined to lay off 200 policemen on Jan. 1 beause of a budget crisis even if an alternative plan aimed at saving some of the jobs could be found.Mr. Gibson, who had to trim the city budget because of a loss of $10 million in Federal aid, has said that the 1,100-officer department accounts for nearly onefourth of the operating budget and that \u201cit will sustain the largest reduction.\u201dThe spokesman for the Mayor said today that the layoffs \u201cwere carefully thought out to keep the balance in the delivery of services and we don't believe shuffling a few jobs will improve an unpleasant situation.\u201dMeanwhile, policemen continued their \u201cfear city\u201d demonstration, which underscores the city's crime statistics, and criticized the transfer of older men to patrol duty as a symptom of deteriorating police service. Shopkeepers and neighborhood spokesmen also talked of an increase of fear in the wake of the announced layoffs.Vigilante Action FearedCouncilman Sharpe James of the South Ward was one of those who said the Mayor's office was resisting efforts aimed at restoring some of the proposed cuts in the Police Department budget and he added that fear was leading to \u201cvigilante\u201d activity in some areas.\u201cI attended a meeting of the neighborhood group and they were talking about arming themselves and patrolling their own streets,\u201d Mr. James said.A total of 950 of the city's 5,000 employees have received pink slips. The other employees are in the Recreation, Health and Welfare and Public Works Departments.Following a seven\u2010hour meeting with administration officials, Councilman Anthony Carrino of the North'Ward said, \u201cI get the impression they don't want to save the jobs of the policemen. They keep putting up roadblocks to all of our suggestions.\u201dNevertheless, both men said the Council intended to restudy the proposed $110 million city operating budget to eliminate appropriations for jobs it feels are less essential than police protection and to transfer these funds to the Police Department.Hubert Williams, the city Police Director, has ordered the transfer of 90 men, including 23 superior officers, to patrol duties to make up for some of the anticipated manpower loss, and Mr. Carrino said representatives of the Fraternal Order of Police believed the move confirmed their fear that the layoffs would hurt police efficiency.\u2018I've Given Up Alt Hope\u2019\u201cThe layoffs affect men who joined the department going back to 1972 and in clude most of those between 20 and 30 years old,\u201d said Mr. Carrino, who has served nine years as a policeman and who is on leave of absence while serving on the Council.\u201cWhat we have left are a lot of men in their 50's being ordered back on patrol,\u201d he said. \u201cI know one man who has one lung and he was taken off the information desk and put back in a patrol car.\u201dDemonstrating policemen were back on street corners today handing out flyers urging residents to write or telephone Mr. Gibson to demand a recision of the layoff notices. However, some of the men were pessimistic about their future.\u201cI've given up all hope,\u201d said John Zajkowski, a 29-year-old officer facing his third layoff since he joined the force in 1972.\u201cMy wife is expecting our first child, but what kind of a Christmas can we have when I'm going to have to look for a job a few days later?\u201d he asked.Thomas Possumato, president of the police union, said that the department had only 1,100 officers, far below its rated strength of 1,900, and that the loss of the additional 200 officers would seriously impair the department's ability to provide protection.\u201cMorale is low, the men are frustrated and who can blame them,\u201d Mr. Possumato said.Part of the pessimism stems from an interview Mayor Gibson gave while attending a mayors\u2019 conference in Atlanta in July.Copies of a news story containing the interview were being circulated at the police union headquarters today. In it, Mr. Gibson is quoted as saying, \u201cI'd cut the Police Department in half if I could get away with it,\u201d and adding that \u201cthe crime rate wouldn't change one 100th of 1 percent\u201d if he made the deep manpower cuts.A spokesman for Mr. Gibson said he had been quoted \u201cout of context\u201d and added that Newark's police strength was among the largest of any comparable city in the United States.Police union spokesmen said one reason for lower crime\u2010rate statistics is that 40,000 police calls went unaswered last year because of the lack of manpower and never became part of the statistics. They said the average time a victim waited for a policeman in Newark was between 30 minutes and four hours.\u2018We Need These Guys\u2019Patrolman Jack McEntee told of being sent out on a report of stabbing at 3 A.M. only to find that the victim had been treated at a local hospital and sent home at 11 P.M. Other policemen told of similar incidents. \u201cWhen you get sent out sometimes you are told, \u2018By the way, this call is four hours old,\u2019 \u201c Mr. Zajkowski said.Rodrigo Ramos, a veteran policeman who is not on the layoff list, said he was supporting the other patrolmen in their effort to roll back the layoffs.\u201cWe need these young guys,\u201d Mr. Ramos said, \u201cespecially if we are going to protect the citizens of Newark.\u201dEven without the \u201ccity of fear\u201d cam\u2010. paign, many local merchants say they fear reduced police patrols.\u201cI'm going to have to keep my door locked and let my customers in one at a time,\u201d said Vincent Custode, the owner of a hair\u2010styling salon on Raymond Boulevard. \u201cIt's tough enough to get a policeman now when you need one.\u201dAnd James Fisher, a security guard at an Academy Street office building, said, \u201cWhen you want a cop you can't get one now, I don't know what will happen next year.\u201dThe New York Times/Edward HausnerOn Raymond Boulevard, Newark, an off\u2010duty police officer distributes leaflets opposing Police Departmenmt layoffs"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/21/archives/illinois-defendant-loses-appeal-on-sign-language.html", "headline": "ILLINOIS DEFENDANT LOSES APPEAL ON SIGN LANGUAGE", "date": "1978-06-21T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from June 21, 1978, Section A, Page 13Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Mr. Lang, then 32 years old, was found incompetent to stand trial and was held by the state for six years until the Illinois Supreme. Court ruled he should stand trial. By that time the key witness in the case had died and Mr. Lang was released.He was convicted in 1972 of murdering a second woman. However, the Illinois Appellate Court reversed the conviction on the ground that Mr. Lang was unable to communicate with his lawyers and therefore could not defend himself. Judge Joseph J. Schneider of Cook County Circuit Court then ordered the state mental health department take custody of Mr. Lang and teach him sign language so he could stand trial.The Appellate Court ruled today. that Judge Schneider erred in his decision and that, under Illnois law, the department is not legally required to treat people who are not mentally retarded. \u201cUntil the legislature enacts approprtiate legislation to deal with situations such as this, we can only endeavor to follow the mandate of present law,\u201d Judge Robert J.

Robert H. Grossberg, a vice president in the office here of Shearson, Hayden Stone Inc., is always looking for ways to increase business.A few months ago. tie found a group that appeared to be untapped by other firms.\u201cI obtained some publications for the deaf and didn't see any ads in them from brokerage firms,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I figured that either the business was not there or nobody had thought of it vet.\u201dWith the help of Barbara Belsky, who handles the internal communication system at Shearson's offices here, he set out to identify and approach potential investors among the deaf.First, Mr. Grossberg and Miss Belsky, who has a hearing impairment herself. wrote to households with teletypewriters hooked up to regular telephone lines. The listings came from the International Telephone Directory of the Deaf. The next move was to install a teletypewriter in the Shearson office.\u201cIt's a very small world with the deaf people,\u201d said Miss Belsky. \u201cAnd the deaf are insecure in the hearing world. Once the word gets spread around, business picks up.\u201dThe first deaf customer invested more than $50,000 through the firm. Since then, another half\u2010dozen accounts have been opened through the teletypewriter system.The only other broker using such a teletypewriter system, according to those who deal with the hard\u2010of\u2010hearing, is Ardys Thayer of the E. F. Hut ten & Company office in Universal City, Calif. Miss Thayer, who also knows sign language, has offered this service for about two years.One of Mr. Grossherg's accounts was opened by Edward and Greta Goodman, who communicate regularly with Shearson via the teletypewriter. \u201cIt is really great,\u201d Mrs. Goodman typed the other day.When one of his deaf customers comes to the office, Mr. Grossberg\u2014a 41\u2010year\u2010old broker who has been at Shearson for 15 years\u2014asks Miss Belsky, who knows sign language, to interpret. Mr. Grossherg's sign language is limited to communica??ng his name.Mr. Crossberg says that the number of deaf people in the Miami area is not a large enough base en whic?? to build a new service. Therefore, he plans to aevelop it nationally. He has advertised in Silent News and other publications for the deaf, asking readers to tell him their teletypewriter numbers and the kind of inves??ment information they want.

There are about 2 million deaf people in the country and more than 13 million others with degrees of hearing impairment.\u201cThe decision is extremely significant because It recognizes that handicapped people should be judged not on their handicap, but on their ability to compete in an academic program,\u201d Sy DuBow said.Mr. DuBow is the director of legal services for the National Association of the Deaf Legal Defense Fund, a two\u2010year\u2010old organization here that took up the cause of Frances E. Davis, a licensed practical nurse, when a Federal District Court in North Carolina ruled against her civil rights suit.Reversed the RulingLast week, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed that ruling, ordering Southeastern Community College near Fayetteville, N.C., to reconsider Miss Davis's application \u201cwithout regard to her hearing disability.\u201dWriting for a unanimous panel, Judge Kenneth K. Hall suggested that the district court, to which he remanded the case, should \u201cconsider that the college could be required to modify the nursing program so as to accommodate the plaintiff and her hearing disability.\u201dThe judge said that there was precedent for requiring \u201caffirmative conduct\u201d by a college to meet the problems of the handicapped \u201ceven when such modifications become expensive.\u201dHe cited rulings last year by appeals courts requiring public transit systems In Minneapolis and in Chicago to modify their equipment so that people in wheelchairs could use them. He also referred to regulations promulgated a year ago, after the District Court decision in the Davis case, by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.The regulations, which implement the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, call for colleges to adapt \u201cthe manner in which specific courses are conducted\u201d so as not to discriminate against the handicapped and to provide \u201ceducational auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills.\u201dMr. DuBow said that such aid might include providing an \u201cinterpreter\u201d to translate lectures into sign language as they are delivered to supplement or to replace lip\u2010reading. At the urging of the legal defense , fund, a Federal District Court has ordered the University of North Carolina to provide such services for a graduate student.Judge Hall did not require the North Carolina college to accept the deaf applicant but only to apply the \u201csame subjective and objective factors utilized in the consideration of other candidates for enrollment in the nursing program.\u201d He conceded that her academic record was \u201cat best mixed.\u201dJudge Hall's decision is now the law in the Fourth Circuit, which includes Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. If the Supreme Court agrees to review the ruling and affirms it, the legal precedent would acquire national effect."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/20/archives/deaf-boy13is-slain-by-landlord-on-failing-to-heed-shout-to-stop.html", "headline": "Deaf Boy, 13, Is Slain by Landlord On Failing to Heed Shout to Stop", "date": "1978-03-20T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from March 20, 1978, Section B, Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

According to the police, the boy, Ciprian Septimo Jr. of SO North Greenwich Street, was struck in the left eye and fell dead into an alley.Mr. Monaco, who was said to be employed in the traffic section of the Sanitation Department, was booked on homicide charges last night.The shooting occurred just before 5 P.M., four blocks from the boy's home, a \u2018large apartment building between Greenwich and Washington Streets, The police said the boy was wearing a bracelet identifying him as deaf and suffering from heart disease.Described as \u2018Quiet Boy\u2019His father described him last night as a \u201cvery quiet boy\u201d who attended a school for the deaf. Mr. Septimo, a checker on the docks who came here from the Dominican Republic in 1960, said young Ciprian had left the house in the afternoon with a baseball to play with some other children.About 15 minutes afer he left, Mr. Septimo said, the police called the house to inform the family of the shooting. which took place in the neighborhood bordered by Chambers and Canal Streets near the Hudson River.Mr. Septimo said his son was born in New York City and had two sisters, one younger and one older.Mr. Monaco was identified as the owner of 426 Greenwich Street, a three- story building near Laight street, with an apartment on the ground floor. The police said he told them he had heard a noise and had seen two boys on the second floor entering the vacant apartment from the outside, where there is a broad ledge in the back of the house.Going back into his apartment, Mr. Monaco loaded his rifle with two shells and went to the second floor, the police quoted him as having said. When he looked ont the window, the police further quoted him as having said, he saw one of the intruders stall on the ledge, heading for a iaclthr to the backyard.According to the police, Mr. Monaco told them he fired only when the boy failed to heed his shouts..The boy then fell, ripping his clothes on some pipes. The bullet probably killed him instantly, the police said.Detectives said an upstairs tenant then called the police to the scene.

Smithdas, director of community education for the Uelenller National Center for DeafBlind Youths and Adults.\u201cIt's a psychological fear.\u201d said Dr. Smithdas, who is deaf and blind himself. \u201cIf there is anything a blind person is afraid of, it's losing his hearing, and if there's anything a deaf person is afraid of, it's losing his sight. So, few of them learn to communicate with the deafblind.\u201dAlthough like Dr. Smithdas they often are able to express their thoughts orally. deaf\u2010blind people can \u201cspeak\u201d with each other by forming sign language symbols\u2022 into a \u201clistener's\u201d cupped hand. When people who don't understand sign language are around, they use interpreters. And at this multilingual conference, the procedure was sometimes elaborated to involve an interpreter from signlanguage into, say, German, and from German into English.The conference is being sponsored by the World Council for the Welfare of the Blind under United Nations sanctions. The Helen Keller Center, a residential and trainitg facility In Sands Point, L.L, is the host agency for the 200 participants, including researchers, rehabilitation specialists and interpreters.A major cause of tilt double\u2010handicap Is a \u2018condition called Ulner Syndrome, in which an individual is born congenitally deaf and later loses his sight through another disease, retinitis pigmentosa.Meta half the cases screened at the Helen Keller Center have been attributed to the syndrome. Parents of congenitally deaf children are just beginning to realize the significance of retinitis pigmentosa, according to Dr. Smithdas.Another leading cause is rubella, or German measles. There were several serious rubella epidemics a decade or so ago, leading many professionals in the field to fear a significant increase in the number of children who would develop deafness and blindness.A national effort is under way to stress to parents the importance of rubella vaccinations and to encourage schools for the deaf to screen their pupils for early signs of retinitis pigmentosa.It is this kind of activity that the conference hopes to see increase and standardize on an international scale, according to Dr. Richard Kinney, the conference chairman.One of the delegates to the meeting is Sergei Sirotkin, a 28.year\u2010old Russian who, according to a spokesman, recently became one of four deaf\u2010blind persons in the Soviet Union to become a university graduate. He was accompanied by Dr. Rassa Mareeva, senior research worker in deaf\u2010blindness at the Defectology Research Institute in the Soviet Union.Mr. Sirotkin, who is the son of a driver and an elevator operator, had the unique experience of being taken into special training for his handicap when he was only 5 years old. Dr. Mareeva said through an interpreter, and as a result he remains the subect of intense study. A Presidential School for the DeafBlind was established in 1963 in Zagorsk, near Moscow, Dr. Mareeva noted.When he returns home, he said in sign language to Dr. Mareeva who repeated his words in Russian to an English interpreter, he will tell his deaf\u2010blind friends \u201cthat they are discussed now on an international scale, and it is no longer a problem just of single nations.\u201dAt a time when other handicapped groups are demanding inclusion in \u201cmainstream\u201d institutions for education and job training, the blind\u2010deaf are seeking more specialized institutions tailored to their particular needs, Dr. Smithdas said. \u2022\u201cWho wants, to live in the mainstream if the mainstream pushes them off to the side?\u201d he asked.How does a deaf\u2010blind person know when a doorbell is ringing?Among the devices that have been tried are vibrators whose motions can he felt through the floor and wrist\u2010vibrators set off by a radio signal.The New York Times/Don Hogan Charles"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/25/archives/us-five-captures-gold-at-world-games-for-deaf.html", "headline": "U.S. Five Captures Gold At World Games for Deaf", "date": "1977-07-25T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 25, 1977,  Page 31Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

At 8 o'clock, \u201cNova,\u201d produced by Boston's station WGBH, has \u201cAcross the Silence Barrier,\u201d a broad and remarkably informative study of deafness. At 9, WNET/13's \u201cDance in America\u201d looks at \u201ctrailblazers of Modern Dance.\u201dPublic television has been a trail blazer itself in trying to make programming accessible to the estimated 14 million Americans with severe hearing impairments\u2014at least one million are \u201cprofoundly\u201d or totally deaf. With various grants over the last few years, the public system has been experimenting with programs using captions or sign language, proving that the cost is not beyond the means of either networks or viewers.By far the most promising result has been the development of a system for encoding subtitles in the television picture that are visible only if the home receiver is equipped with a special adapter or decoder. This would allow the special audience to be served without disturbing the regular audience, which, all altruistic testimonials to the contrary, does not like to be disturbed. Public television recently awarded a contract to Texas Instruments manufacture a technically and economically feasible decoder.\u2022Tonight's documentary, written, directed and produced by Francis Gladstone, focuses on profoundly deaf persons and the various programs that exist for treating them. If nothing else, the program makes quite clear that deafness is far more than a problem of simply not hearing.It can be an impediment to the most basic types of learning. As one man notes, deaf people have special difficulties learning, among other things, language or social customs or the rights of others. For this reason, deafness has frequently been misdiagnosed as mental retardation, and it is thought that several thousand such cases are still undiscovered in the United States.At the core of most treatments for deafness is the question of whether the impairment is viewed as a handicap to be overcome or a difference to be accepted. The purely oral approach, stressing speech skills, is determined to rise above the handicap. The sign language schools openly concede differ ences.This documentary shows both, but implies the purely oral may be too devastating for most students. A combination of the two schools now appears the most satisfactory solution. Along the way, for examples of what can be done, the program interviews an assortment of experts, plus actors from the superb National Theater for the Deaf and workers at a factory called Silent Industries.\u2022\u201cTrailblazers of Modern Dance\u201d begins, of course, with Isadora Duncan, captured in old photographs and film, biographical passages read by Rosemary Harris and a Frederick Ashton Ballet, \u201cFive Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan,\u201d danced by Lynn Seymour. It concludes with Mar tha Graham in a 1941 film of her \u201cLamentations.\u201dIn between, there are Ruth St. Denis. Ted Shawn, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris, just to mention the more prominent. The film footage, rare and invaluable, is fascinating. The esthetic causes are astonishing', both for their dedication and sometimes looney pretentiousness. Isadore, for instance, is recalled fondly by Mr. Ashton for her \u201crevolutionary soul, for instance, and all that sort of thing.\u201dThe hour tells us as much about art and life in America, from Greenwich Village to Hollywood, as about dance in relatively rarefied circles. It's funny and touching and simply wonderful. The producers are Merrill Brockway and Judy Kinberg. The director is Emile Ardolino."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/28/archives/soviet-institute-develops-skills-of-blind-deaf.html", "headline": "Soviet Institute Develops Skills Of Blind, Deaf", "date": "1977-02-28T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 28, 1977,  Page 9Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Mareyeva sat at a table in the Institute of Defectology, for the study of the handicapped, in the Soviet Union the other day holding hands with whitehaired Olga I. Skorokhodova. Their fingers fluttered in an exchange not of affection, though love was certainly there, but of simple conversation.Mrs. Mareyeva is a latter\u2010day miracle worker whose professionalism dissolves into a radiant smile at the first encouraging stutter or gesture from her charges. With formidable patience, she labors to bring forth the talents of those who have entered life devoid of the gifts of sight and hearing.When the first Soviet program for the blind and deaf was set up in Kharkov in the mid\u20101920's, among its earliest pupils was Miss Skorokhodova, who has earned the kind of esteem here that the late Helen Keller held in the United States.Soviet scientists, like their American polleagues, are struggling with the probelms of physical defects. Mrs. Mareyeva, who heads the Laboratory on the Education and Upbringing of Blind and Deaf Children, has already seen her painstaking efforts flourish: Four blind and deaf students are preparing to graduate together from the psychology department of Moscow State university.Problems of Speech and ImaginationOne is Sergei A. Sirotkin, whom Mrs. Mareyeva taught years ago as a child. Now 28 years old, he has undertaken research on the mastery of speech, Which was described as the hardest adtustment. His fellow student, Aleksandr V. Suvorov, 23, is analyzing the probtem of imagination for the handicapped end writes poetry when ha feels the urge.Each week, if Mrs. Mareyeva can, She travels 45 miles north to Zagorsk to visit 54 blind and deaf children who are being educated and taught trades at a special school. At the laboratory in Moscow she works with new referrals and problem cases. Though training of the blind and deaf is free, Mrs. Mareyeva said, some families still do not realize that help is available.Miss Skorokhodova, speaking In gentle, high\u2010pitched voice, recalled how she learned about Miss Keller as young girl. \u201cShe bedtime a kind of lodestar for me,\u201d said Miss Skorokhodova, who is in her early 60's. \u201cAt first I was depressed by my lack of sight and hearing. I thought I could do nothing useful. But when I heard about her I decided there was a place for me.\u201dUnder the guidance of a Soviet pioneer in the field, Ivan A. Sokolyansky, Miss Skorokhodova completed her education and launched a career of passing her experience on to others. She is now concentrating on the moral upbringing of blind and deaf children.Encouragement and CorrectionMiss Skorokhodova stressed that once the handicapped learned to talk, they should be constantly encouraged and corrected by those around them. She has even devised a system to speak with friends by long\u2010distance telephone.Tatyana A. Vlasova, director of the institute, which is an affiliate of the Soviet Academy of Pedagogical Sciences, belhves that the Soviet concept of the collective has fostered public responsibility that encourages a useful role for the physically handicapped. Agreeing, Miss Skorokhodova commented: \u201cThe most important thing is not to abandon blind and deaf people to themselves. They must be brought into society.\u201dIn a laboratory room another technician, Galina V. Vasina, hugged 7\u2010yearold Anya Gornshtein and guided the whimpering child's hands to her throat to feel the strange vibrations of words. Mrs. Mareyeva, looking on, said that when Anya, who was found to have vestigial sight, was brought in a year ago, she could not feed or dress herself and her distressed parents feared that she was severely retarded. \u201cAll she could do was shake objects before her eyes,\u201d Mrs. Mareyeva said. \u201cNow she can perform complicated tasks.\u201dThe Shortcuts Are FewThe techniques that must be used suggest that there are few shortcuts. For example, children are encouraged to sculpture to deevlop their touch, which also allows examination of their perception of surroundings. A communicating machine, called a teletactor, enables a teacher to converse with a class of up to 10 pupils, using a keyboard console to which they respond over neglike terminals. Mrs. Mareyeva said the concept was not unique but its application was.No substitute for individual affection has been improvised. Before the Zagoisk school was opened in 1963 Mrs. Mareyeva reared Sergei Sirotkin herself. Violent at the outset, he once sank his teeth into her arm; she endured the pain until his bite slackened. On another occasion, she recalled, he kept throwing off his blanket during a nap; she counted putting it back a hundred times. But by the time he was 7 they took apart an alarm clock together. \u201cYou should have seen the joy when we reassembled it and it started ticking!\u201d she said with a laugh.Mrs. Mareyeva explained her philosophy: \u201cThe most important thing is to respect each child as a human being. Never deceive him. You should never scold him if he fails to do something. You have to find out the reason for it.\u201d That has not made her demands any less exacting. \u201cNever give him prepared knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cMake him discover it for himself.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1976/05/19/archives/train-kills-deaf-man.html", "headline": "Train Kills Deaf Man", "date": "1976-05-19T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from May 19, 1976,  Page 59Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

At first this seems somewhat like a Clubbed foreign film, but soon the dubbers themselves become part of the action. Like the manipulators of Bunraku puppets, they shadow their alter egos. Occasionally they join them in a dance or a song. The line between speaking and nonspeaking performer is blurred.The result is a doubling and, in some cases, a deepening of performance. The approach is particularly dramatic at the moment of possession. When the dead young man inhabits the body of the young bride\u2010to\u2010be, and the actress, Freda Norman, begins to contort herself and to express her frenzy, her dubbed voice suddenly turns from female to male.Those signs are a show by themselves. As the hysteria increases, the signs seem to become faster aind more frantic. The sign for dybbuk calls for the actor to draw his hands apart, vertically, in a mysterious gesture, as if he is holding a snake, perhaps what the play refers to as \u201cthe primal snake, Satan himself.\u201d The exorcism, as the tormented rabbi attempts to banish the spirit, needs no words as it builds to its anguished climax.John Broome's production is a dark and foreboding (even the lighting is dim). The stage is thickly curtained, the actors heavily costumed. In contrast, and as a relief, following \u201cThe Dybbuk,\u201d the stage is stripped of its draperies, the lights become bright and the evening turns hap pily comic with \u201cPriscilla, Princess of Power.\u201dThis brief cartoon, adapted by the company from a script by James Stevenson (a cartoonist and children's book author), is a pop\u2010art spoof of a high\u2010caloric society. The villain is Dr. Schlock, the world's most evil dentist,\u201d who is the secret head of a supersugary jelly bean factory. The heroine, Priscilla, is a dull cog in the factory treadmill transformed into a high\u2010kicking Wonder Woman (cape flying, the actress Linda Bove gives a sprightly performance).The dialogue, much of it dubbed in balloons drawn in the air, is mostly pow, sock and wham. Narration is provided by Elaine Bromka. The humor is broad and some of it is cute (as in an animated version of Charles Atlas's \u201chero of the beach\u201d advertisement that is spliced into this comic book).But the playlet reminds us \u2014particularly after the somber \u201cDyhbuk\u201d\u2014of the company's talent for antic comedy and improvisation. The actors mime, among other things, a jellybean assembly line, a drive\u2010in movie theater and, most amusingly, a filling station with a pump gurgling gas through a pour\u2010me\u2010out spout."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/26/archives/chimps-learning-signs-faster-with-deaf.html", "headline": "Chimps Learning Signs Faster With Deaf", "date": "1975-02-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 26, 1975,  Page 44Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

After her first six months of training, Washoe had learned only two signs.The baby chimps named Majo and Pill (Swahili for \u201cone\u201d and \u201ctwo\u201d) had learned 15 and 13 words after six months in training.Because Washoe went on to learn more than 165 words in succeeding years, the researchers suspect that Moja and Pili will go on to gain an even more impressive language ability.A Pioneer TeamThe experiment is being conducted under the supervision of Dr. Allan Gardner and Dr. Beatrice Gardner, a husband\u2010wife team of psychologists at the University of Nevada who pioneered this kind of language research by teaching and raising Washoe.When Washoe reached adulthood, the Gardners gave her to one of their students, Roger Fouts, who took her to the Institute for Primate Studies in Norman, Okla., where she is still receiving training under his supervision. Dr. Fouts said he hoped to continue working with Washoe throughout her lifetime. Chimpanzees frequently live into their 50s.The Gardners decided to start anew under more favorable circumstances. When they began with Washoe, the Gardners were themselves just learning sign language and were not very fluent. Washoe was al\u2010 ready much older than the age at which human infants are first exposed to language.This time the Gardners chose to begin with chimpanzees only a day or two old and to place them in homes of either deaf people or of a couple whose parents were deaf. The infant chimps are being raised much as if they were human with their foster parents making signs to them as deaf parents would to a human baby.Earliest ProgressBoth Moja and Pili began making recognizable signs by the time they were three months old. Moja's first signs were \u201ccome \u2010 gimme,\u201d \u201cgo,\u201d \u201cmore,\u201d and \u201cdrink.\u201d Pili's were \u201cdrink,\u201d \u201ccome\u2010gimme,\u201d \u201cmore,\u201d and \u201ctickle.\u201dAs an example of how the chimps use their words, the Gardners said the animals would be asked a question such as, \u201cWhat we play now?\u201d and the chimpanzee would respond, \u201ctickle.\u201dTheir findings were published as an interim report on the project in the Feb. 28 issue of Science magazine.\u201cWhile the age at which chimpanzees produce their first signs seems early compared to that for first words of humans,\u201d the Gardners wrote, \u201cit is not very discrepant from the age at which the first signs appear in humans.\u201dWhile human children seldon begin using spoken words before they are a year old, children of deaf couples often begin making signs when they are five or six months old.It is sometimes said that children pick up sign language faster than spoken language because it is easier to form the gesture than the sound.The Gardners suggest that the apparent discrepancy between the times of acquisition of sign and spoken language exists because it is easier for parents to recognize an infant's poor approximation of a sign than its poor approximation of a spoken word."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/13/archives/new-jersey-pages-deafness-no-handicap-to-jersey-court-star.html", "headline": "Deafness No Handicap To jersey Court Star", "date": "1975-02-13T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 13, 1975,  Page 73Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

His 6\u2010foot\u20102\u00bdinch size dictates that he perform in the forecourt, although he has the dribbling ability and the court sense to play at guard. He has a better than 50 per cent shooting average, scores well off the drive and is a strong rebounder. Goodis, however, is quite different from most athletically\u2010skilled youngsters. He cannot hear, the victim of a nerve defect that left him deaf at birth.Yet, the senior for Marie Katzenbach School for the Deaf in West Trenton has not let that handicap him on the basketball court. Last season, he became the Mercer County high school career scoring leader.And last week, Ernie moved past the 2,000\u2010point mark in career scoring, an achievement shared by only 16 other New Jersey schoolboys. Obviously, it was the highlight of a remarkable career for him and his fans, 300 of whom traveled to South Brunswick to watch Ernie score 26 points.\u201cEmotionally, he never showed he was trying for it and never got overly excited about it, but I know he was,\u201d Coach John Fedorchak points out. \u201cHe was a little fidgety before the game, but he played his regular game. He reacts well under pressure.\u201dErnie is also a pitcher on the baseball team, alternating between first and third base when he is not on the mound, and he's one of the club's leading hitters. This season and last he played wing for the soccer team.\u201cHe can take any game and, after a few days, he has learned it pretty well,\u201d notes Fedorchak, who has been teaching physical education at the school since 1940.Ernie, whose point total was 2,037 through a 6\u201010 won\u2010lost record this season, began honing his basketball talents in a Catholic Youth Organization program and has made his parents, who live in Willingboro, proud of his accomplishments. Last summer, he played in a Burlington County summer league and averaged 25 points a game.Fedorchak, who communicates to the players through the use of hand signs, says that growing up in a family situation probably helped Ernie learn quickly to lip read. He's an above\u2010average student, but he has had some reading interpretation problems one would expect.He would like to attend a regular college, but will also be considering Gallaudet College in Washington, the only college for deaf in the country, or Rochester Institute of Technology, which has a program for the deaf.Hopefully, there will be the chance to continue his athletics, too. They have meant a lot to him and to the people around him."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/11/archives/physicians-describe-auditory-hallucinations-in-the-deaf-as.html", "headline": "Physicians Describe Auditory Hallucinations in the Deaf as Physiological and Not Psychiatric Symptoms", "date": "1975-02-11T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 11, 1975,  Page 18Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

The doctors, for lack of a specific explanation, concluded that a wide variation of physiological mechanisms, similar to those working in normal sensory processes, and perceptions are involved in the hallucinations experienced by deaf patients.Their report, which was published in the issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association published yesterday, was designed to alert more doctors to the little\u2010appreciated phenomenon.5 Substantiated CasesSeveral reports of the condition have been published in foreign languages. But the authors said that \u201cvery few\u201d American doctors were acquainted with the problem because just five substantiated cases had been reported in English language medical journals.In the absence of such reports, most American doctors have come to consider auditory hallucinations as symptoms of epilepsy, brain tumors, brain, damage from chronic alcoholism, and mental disorders such as psychoses and schizophrenia. Auditory hallucinations often affect paranoid patients, who describe hearing voices with messages of a threatening nature.The National Center for Health Statistics says that 3.8 million Americans have hearing problems. Just how many have auditory hallucinations is unknown, but the incidence may well be more common than is generally appreciated, since pa tients may not seek medical attention or may be reluctant to mention the symptom for fear that it would suggest a psychia tric disorder,\u201d the doctors said.Further, the authors, Drs. Elliott D. Ross, Paul B. Jossman, Benjamin Bell. Thomas Sabin and Norman Geschwind, who are specialists in nervous system and ear diseases on the faculties of all three Boston medical schools\u2014Harvard, Boston University and Tufts\u2014suggested that some deaf patients who described hallucinations might be mistakenly referred to psychiatrists or hospitalized in psychiatric wards.An almost stereotyped pat tern emerged as the doctor studied the phenomenon. In contrast to psychotic patients who did not realize that their hallucinations were not real, the deaf patients fully appreciated that what they were hearing did not exist outside of the mind.The hallucinations usually began acutely in the deaf or deafer ear after a long history of progressive hearing loss. The music was a highly organized, vivid and intricate perception that almost always reflected past musical memories.Most patients heard the music as a repetition of the same melody that began on awakening and continued through the day. Though often disturbing, sometimes the hallucinations were pleasing enough so that the patient sang along and harmonized with them.\u2018Do You Think I'm Crazy?\u2019Yet the patients asked the doctors, \u201cDo you think I'm crazy?\u201d after describing their symptoms.A 75\u2010year\u2010old man who had been deaf for more than a decade said he had just begun to hear a soprano or baritone voice or a tenor and baritone voice singing hymns he had previously sung in a church choir.The patient's only control over the hallucinations was his ability to change the tunes by singing aloud or thinking about another melody. Sometimes the experience was so annoying that he would try to suppress it by playing a radio loudly. His sleep was hardly disturbed, but if he awoke during the night, he might hear a melody.However, an 83\u2010year\u2010old woman who had been deaf for 25 years heard a continuous medley of Irish jigs and Christmas carols that did not disrupt daily activities but were particularly bothersome when she tried to fall asleep. The halluciinations occurred whether or not she used a hearing aid, and sometimes they switched to the opposite ear.The doctors noted that the auditory hallucinations evolved in a pattern almost completely opposite to those of the phantom limb, which tends to occur acutely after amputation, disappears with time and never results from a slowly progressive loss of limbs.Because the pattern was closer to that seen in individuals who have visual hallucinations, the doctors suspected that more cases of auditory hallucinations would be detected among Americans if deaf patients were directly questioned about the phenomenon."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/06/archives/swiss-skiers-excel-in-games-for-deaf.html", "headline": "Swiss Skiers Excel in Games for Deaf", "date": "1975-02-06T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 6, 1975,  Page 43Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Y.\u2014Steven Bock's parents have long forgotten the name of the doctor who first diagnosed his deafness. They call him \u201cDr. Clicker\u201d because of the sound made by the instrument he held the baby's ears.\u201cIt went click, click, click. It looked like those little turtle toys the kids play with,\u201d Richard Bock recalled the other day. \u201cThen he said, \u2018Steven's deaf.\u2019 Then we got a bill for $50. No advice on where to go, what to do\u2014nothing.\u201dThis was more than 15 years ago. Soon after that experience, the Bocks visited a more sensitive doctor and received a more precise diagnosis: Steven was classified as \u201cprofoundly deaf,\u201d which meant that, on a scale of 100, his hearing loss was 80 decibels or more. Less than 15 per cent of the country's 1.2 million hearing\u2010impaired children are so handicapped. Theirs is a select and virtually silent world.Speech and Hearing ClinicEarly therapy is vital to such children. So, when Steven was about 18 months old, his mother began taking him to Columbia University's Speech and Hearing Clinic. Later, were private therapists, a series of special nursery schools and, finally, Public School 158 in Manhattan, a school for the language and hearing impaired.In 1969 the Bocks moved to Westhester County and transferred Steven to the New York State School for the Deaf in White Plains. Placed in an advance class, he was making \u201cstraight A's\u201d and \u201calways on the dean's list\u201d when suddenly, about a year ago, Steven rebelled.\u201cHe wouldn't go to school,\u201d Ulrike Bock said, shaking her head. He said: \u201cI want out.'\u201dWhy? Steven, a slim, sandy\u2010haired 16\u2010year\u2010old with a dazzling smile, was reading the conversation from the speakers\u2019 lips. His eyes, blue\u2010gray behind the aviator glasses, grew wide and he replied: \u201cI wanted a better world.\u201dLike many who were born deaf, Steven has a blurred speech. His message was clear, however, as he spoke of days at the deaf school, of classmates working on different levels, of teachers distracted by \u201cmany problems,\u201d of feeling bored and frustrated.His brother, Lawrence, just 11 months younger, was reading adult books at Horace Greeley High School. Steven's books were \u201cbabyish.\u201d Now a Greeley student himself, Steven is reading \u201cOf Human Bondage,\u201d by W. Somerset Maugham.But it wasn't simply the school work. Over and over, Steven referred to the \u201cbetter world\u201d and then, grabbing notebook, he wrote furiously: \u201cI was consumed by emotions, by moods \u201dAlthough Steven probably didn't realize it at the time, he was espousing the latest in educational concepts\u2014a trend toward \u201cmainstreaming\u201d the handicapped into the regular school system. His parents were not nearly so provessive. In fact, for the first time in Steven's life, the Bocks tried to discourage him.\u201cUp to this point our philosophy with Steven was sink\u2010or\u2010swim,\u201d said Richard Bock, a 41\u2010year\u2010old stockbroker who refuses to leave Wall Street where he sinking a bit himself these days.\u201cWe knew we couldn't pity or baby Steven,\u201d Mr. Bock said. \u201cWhen he was 10, we sent him to a hearing camp, not a deaf camp. He was forced to communicate. If he didn't talk, he didn't eat.\u201dAnd how did Steven communicate at Camp Pok\u2010O\u2010Moonshine in the Lake Champlain region? \u201cI wrote in the dirt,\u201d he said.At 12, Steven began to show his father's talent for investment. Not in stocks, especially. Steven was a collector of rare coins and a tireless writer of letters to coin companies that he signed with a flourish: \u201cSteven Bock, The Silver Investor.\u201dAt 13, he was boarding trains for New York City, where he delighted in dickering with the sellers of silver coins and bars, \u201cIt's a scary city,\u201d his mother said. noting that some Chappaqua parents won't allow their hearing children to venture into the city alone. Yet Steven Bock, a boy with limited speech and an inability to use the telephone, was about the city on Saturdays, a subway map in his jeans.Despite years of prodding Steven into independence, the Bocks found themselves \u201cterribly frightened\u201d when he announced that he no longer wanted to learn through sign language, that he wanted to go to school with hearing children.Mr. Bock's first reaction: \u201cThat's like taking a blind kid to an amusement park and saying, \u2018Here's the tickets. See you later.'\u201dWorried that Steven would fail, or worse yet, be ridiculed, Mr. Bock spent hours \u201ctelling him how tough it would be.\u201d\u201cOh, God, did we tell him how tough it would be,\u201d Mrs. Bock murmured.In his first semester, Steven, with grades of A\u2010minus and B\u2010minus, also found time for dates and football games. \u201cWhat's so tough?\u201d he said.Things have not always gone so smoothly for Steven. As an infant, he had to wear a heavy \u201cbody aid,\u201d boxed hearing aid suspended from his shoulder in a harness. He hated that.Then, when Steven was about 3, his mother had to go to the hospital for few days. Mr. Bock recalled that the separation made his son deeply fearful and that when Mrs. Bock came home \u201cSteve would come into our bedroom, 20, 30 times a night and wake us up to make sure we were there. It was wild.\u201dOn the advice of a child psychiatrist, Mrs. Bock slept for several months on beach chair in front of Steven's door. \u201cDo you remember that, Steve,\u201d his father asked.Steven grinned as though he'd never heard of anything so silly. No, he does not remember those times. He thinks he was about 7 when he realized what it means to be deaf.The Unnoticed OneAbout that same time, his brother, Lawrence, who often acted as Steven's interpreter, \u2010began showing the classic signs of a normal child whose needs go unnoticed because of a handicapped child.\u201cLawrence made a key remark when he was about 6,\u201d Mr. Bock said. \u201cHe told Uli and me, wish I was deaf.\u2019 That's when we said, \u2018Hey, this kid's being neglected.'\u201dLike many parents of handicapped children, the Bocks felt \u201cguilt\u201d about their son's deafness and agonized about its causes. Then they stopped, Mr. Bock said.\u201cI guess we reached a point where we said, \u2018Why spend all this time finding out why the kid is deaf? What are we doing spending SI0,000 to find out if it's RH? Let's get going with his education.'\u201dSteven Boclz, the 16\u2010year\u2010old son of the Richard Bochs of Chappaqua, N. Y., recently decided to transfer from a school for the deaf into a regular high school classroom. His adjustment and his parents\u2019 reaction are the subject of this article.

The captioned news is carried on Channel 13 Monday through Friday at midnight.Weather Reports AddedThe captioning is prepared at WGBH\u2010TV in Boston and is fed by the Public Broadcasting Service to 55 stations at 11 o'clock each week night.Special regional weather reports and news items for persons with hearing impairments are added to the telecasts to fill the minutes usually devoted to commercials.Of the public\u2010television stations that now televise the captioned news, only 12 in the East are allowed to carry the broadcast at 11 P.M.\u2014a period that puts it in conflict with most local news telecasts.Many of the ABC stations are reluctant to have their local late\u2010evening news compete with Howard. K. Smith, Harry Reasoner and the rest of the Betwork's Evening News team.Phil Collyer, the director of the Caption Center at WGBH, said current estimates indicate that more than 6 per cent of the United States population have hearing impairments and that nearly four million of these individuals, including about half a million deaf persons, watch the captioned news.Thomas Freebairn, coordinator of television projects for the Deafness Research Training Center at New York University, said that in the metropolitan area the \u201coverwhelming response from the deaf commu nity to the captioned news is positive,\u201d with the biggest complaint being that the broadcast comes on too late.The future of programs for the deaf may depend on the cost factors. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare finances the captioned news project, and P.B.S, has been experimenting with a system that uses \u201cinvisible\u201d captions that can be seen only by those who have a special decoder on their television sets."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/03/archives/storytelling-by-the-theatre-of-the-deaf-and-some-other-fun-for.html", "headline": "Storytelling by the Theatre of the Deaf, and Some Other Fun for Children", "date": "1974-07-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 3, 1974,  Page 37Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

A partial examination suggested she also was pregnant. The doctor once tried to learn more about her and fma herp for Nr from the police and social agencies.It turned out that the woman was neither raped nor pregnant. Yet it took a full two weeks for the doctor, the police, the young woman's mother and her social workers to learn just what had happened to her on the night of May 8. For Juana Garcia is a deaf woman who has lived for nearly 19 years in world of silence and poverty.Juana Garcia (that is not her real name) can neither read nor write. She understands only small amount of sign language. In addition, psychiatrists believe she is mentally disturbed, although they say it is possible that her temper tantrums and runaway attempts could be the end product of her frustrations in not being able to communicate.The Overbearing ProblemsThe story of Juana Garcia suggests some of the overbearing problems that face the handicapped poor. It was obtained through interviews with the woman, her family, her doctors and the police that were granted only with the understanding that her real name and address not be disclosed.Juana was born nearly 19 years ago in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, a small city 50 miles west of San Juan. She lived there until 18 months ago, when she moved permanently to Hunts Point, where her mother and several brothers and sisters lived in a decrepit tenement on Fox Street. Recently, the family moved to another wretched building on the painfully misnamed Tiffany Street, in the same area. Juana's father abandoned the family years ago. Her mother, who lives on public assistance, is an epileptic.Sitting in her spotless living room dominated by a set of the World Book Encyclopedia, Mrs. Garcia explained that Juana was born deaf. But she received no training or schooling for the first 17 years of her life in Puerto Rico because, the mother said in Spanish, \u201cWe were afraid if we brought her to hospital they would keep her.\u201dLast year, with the help of social agencies, Juana was finally placed in a program at the New York Society for the Deaf in Manhattan, where she began learning sign language. Until then, she had communicated with her mother only by pointing and touching.However, Juana frequently disappeared for days on end, until the police would find her and bring her home. Often she would return to her previous home on Fox Street. Three months after she began her work at the Society for the Deaf, she began throwing temper tantrums, disrupting classes and throwing objects against walls.Last fall, Juana was committed to Rockland State Hospital for the mentally ill. and placed in a special 30\u2010bed deaf expert. She also made some lovely jewelry and plaster sculptures in crafts class, which ness unit that has been operated there for 11 years. In the months she was at Rockland, she learned just\u2019 enough sign language to communicate roughly with a highly trained she now shyly \u2010shows to visitors to her home.Last March, Juana was released from Rockland and sent home to the South Bronx.Rockland officials will give out no details about her on the ground of doctor\u2010patient confidentiality. But Dr. Syed Abdullah, a psychiatrist who treated her, noted that as a general principle patients admitted to the unit are those who are \u201cseverely\u201d ill. He said patients were released as soon as the hospital felt they could once again operate in the outside world. Counselors continue to monitor released patients.\u2018The Family Doctor\u2019 Mrs. Garcia still meets regularly with Juana's counselors. She also gets regular shipments of medicine for her from the hospital \u2014 5\u2010milligram Valium tranquilizers.Almost as soon as she returned home, Juana started running away again. Her mother stopped sending her to the Society for the Deaf because the girl would leave for school and then not show up at home again for days.On May 4, Juana appeared in the emergency room at Lincoln Hospital, the clinic that physicians call \u201cthe family doctor of the South Bronx.\u201d She waited five hours to see a doctor (not an uncommon wait at Lincoln's overcrowded facilities), but by the time her name was called, according to hospital records, she had disappeared.Then, on the night of May 8, she was brought to the emergency room again with scrapes on her knees, blood on her underpants and a substance resembling semen on her thighs. Dr. Michael Schwartz, who was on duty that night, remembered having seen her a few days earlier and began to check intoJuana was so traumatized that the attending physicians said they could not examine her properly that night. They took smears and also made plans for further tests because her enlarged uterus suggested pregnancy. Dr. Schwartz reported the case to the police as a possibleBecause the doctors could not communicate with her, they had no way of asking whether she knew anything about her physical condition. Because she seemed so frightened, Dr. Schwartz began to fear for her life. \u201cI had nightmares that one night she'd be brought in dead,\u201d he said. \u201cShe seemed helpless and I thought, maybe, in that neighborhood, someone might be using \u2010her like a stuffed doll.\u201dThe police were similarly frustrated in investigating her case. The Bronx sex\u2010crimes squad first discovered that her address on the hospital records was incorrect, and then found that she was too shy to talk, even through a sign\u2010language specialist.Worse, the sex\u2010crime investigators found Juana in obvious pain when they talked to her at home a week after her emergency\u2010room visit. She was taken back to Lincoln, where it was eventually discovered that she was suffering from a distended bladder (which they treated) and that she was not pregnant after all.Finally, after two unsuccessful interviews, the police drew out from Juana, through an interpreter, an account of the night of May 8.She said she had \u201cfallen down\u201d in the Fox Street hallway and had been taken to the hospital by passers\u2010by. She said she had not been raped. The test for presence of semen proved negative. Satisfied, the sex\u2010crimes squad dropped the case.Mrs. Garcia, meanwhile, expressed anger that her daughter's emergency\u2010room visit had been misinterpreted. The police had upset the girl, she said, adding that she herself thought that Juana had suffered \u201ca nervous breakdown\u201d when she fell on May 8.It is likely that all the facts about Juana's behavior will never be known, because it is hard for even experts to talk to her and because her poverty makes it difficult for her to be thoroughly supervised.Not only can her mother not afford to send her to a boarding school, as the mother would like, but she sometimes can't even keep routine appointments. When The New York Times visited the family last Tuesday, Mrs. Garcia said she and Juana had not been, able to return to Lincoln Hospital that day for blood tests because they had no money for carfare.What kind of a life does Juana lead? With her luminous black eyes sparkling, she showed visitors a picture of a boyfriend, another deaf student. Sources with knowledge of her history say that she is uncommonly active sexually.Some doctors at Lincoln speculated that possibly, being strikingly attractive but deat, she had no choice in the matter. But Dr. Abdullah said the sometimes mentally ill deaf persons \u201cdiscover sexuality as a means of communication.\u2019What of the Future?What is the outlook for Juana? Experts on deafness consider it bleak. Pointing out that most 19\u2010year\u2010old deaf mutes have a fifth\u2010grade education and can be made employable, her multiple handicaps\u2014poverty, illness, illiteracy\u2014will work against her as they have since birth.One ray of hope for Juana is that her experience in the Lincoln emergency room prompted another physician, Dr. Michael Harf, to take a special interest in her care. Dr. Harf, who is Dr. Schwartz's roommate, has arranged for Juana to be regularly looked after by the hospital's health\u2010team clinic.Dr. Kenneth Z. Altshuler, the chief of the deafness unit at Rockland State, said that even if Juana's parents had sought help early, they might not have found it. There is only one small school for the deaf in Puerto Rico. The majority of deaf children on the island, he said, are never even identified by the authorities as deaf.Noting that the Federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare had just rejected a request from New York State or $13.5\u2010million for a hospital or mentally ill deaf children, Dr. Altshuler concluded, \u201cIf you are a deaf mute it pays to have a wealthy family. Every time you add another handicap, you cut the chances of success.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/25/archives/acupuncture-relief-of-nerve-deafness-is-questioned.html", "headline": "Acupuncture Relief of Nerve Deafness Is Questioned", "date": "1974-04-25T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 25, 1974,  Page 30Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

I do not do this myself, nor do I recommend it to my colleagues.\u201dLimited to ChildrenDr. Rosen's conclusions in his paper \u2014 the text of which was released here \u2014 deal solely with the results of his studies of acupuncture in treating nerve deafness in children. His studies did not include the effects of acupuncture treatment for nerve deafness in adults, although others have questioned the effectiveness of such treatment.Nerve deafness is a loss of hearing caused by some damage to the cranial nerve that serves the ear. The deafness can be congenital or it can be caused by a head injury, such as that sustained in an automobile accident.Dr. Rosen said that his studies did not in any way challenge the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of pain or its use as an anesthesic.His paper is one of the first formal presentations of data on an acupuncture treatment regimen for a seemingly incurable disorder for which thousands of children and adults are flocking to private treatment centers that have claimed success in treating nerve deafness. Most are in Washington and Boston, where medical practice laws allow nonphysician technicians to practice under the supervision of doctors. This practice is forbidden in New York State.The Acupuncture Center of Washington, for example, says that, in treating 286 patients for nerve deafness last year, it was able to produce an average improvement of 40 per cent.The Acupuncture Center of America in Washington says that many of its 1,500 patients who have been treated for nerve deafness have experienced up to 30 per cent improvement in their hearing.The Washington Acupuncture Center says it has had improvements of up to 40 per cent with an undefined patient population.None of the three centers have documented these results in the medical literature.The regimens range from 10 treatments to 30 over a sixmonth period, at a minimum cost of $25 each treatment.At the end of last year, Dr. David W. Holmes, director of audiology and speech pathology at the New York State School for the Deaf in Rome, N.Y., tried to obtain hard data on the success rate at the Acupuncture Center of America.\u201cThree of our students had undergone acupuncture treatment at this center, none of which had any significant improvement in hearing threshold,\u201d he said, adding that the same was true of students who received similar treatment in Massachusetts centers.Documentation of the success of the treatment of nerve deafness at American acupuncture clinics has also been questioned by William Aber, chief audiologist at the Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, N.J.\u2018No Significant\u2019 GainsIn a letter prepared for publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, Mr. Aber reports that, in testing 30 adults and children who were treated in various clinics, \u201cthere was no significant improvement in hearing or in the ability to distinguish sounds following acupuncture treatments.\u201dDr. Rosen's study was conducted under the sponsorship of the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine and the New York League for the Hard of Hear. ing.Thirty children were given the traditional treatment that Dr. Rosen learned in Peking, and 10 received treatment with a shallow insertion of needles in the prescribed points. The latter method was meant to serve as a bogus treatment to constitute a control group.Dr. Rosen later found, howwer that the shallow needling was a bona fide treatment in Northeast China, and one of the two children whose hearing had improved had received the treatment that was believed to be a sham.Six\u2010Month TreatmentEach child was treated five days a week for three weeks, then given a week off. The regimen was followed for six months, the minimum period of time the Chinese recommend. The average treatment in China runs from one to four years, Dr. Rosen said.Three months after the treatment was completed, 38 children were tested again, Dr. Rosen said, and 24 showed some change \u2014 slightly better or worse \u2014 in their hearing. But he added that none of these changes were significant enough to be considered an improvement.\u201cWhile detailed comparisons for each of the 40 subjects fails to reveal any consistently maintained improvement, no child ended the study with significantly worse hearing,\u201d Dr. Rosen wrote.He said the fact that there were some variations in the children's hearing abilities during and after the treatment indicated that acupuncture caused \u201csomething, to happen\u201d to children afflicted with nerve deafness. But he added that it was unclear what effect acupuncture had or how it could help improve hearing."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/09/archives/cooke-and-10-deaf-children-stuck-in-elevator-an-hour-cooke-and-10.html", "headline": "Cooke and 10 Deaf Children Stuck in Elevator an Hour", "date": "1974-04-09T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 9, 1974,  Page 1Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

WNYC\u2010TV will conduct the experiment at viewing centers in the metropolitan area on March 8 for the P.B.S. program \u201cReligious America: Crow River Christmas.\u201d The broadcast carrying the captions for the deaf will be shown at noon.One of the decoders will activate television sets at the Lexington School for the Deaf in Jackson Heights, Queens; the other will be placed at the head end of The City University's closed\u2010circuit system, which will feed it to viewing centers at Brooklyn College, Queens College and The City University Graduate Center and The Hunter College Graduate Center, both in Manhattan.To Run Through JuneThe experimental project is being funded by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and will go on through June, wail transmissions approximately once every two weeks.The second program to be captioned for the deaf will be the final program in the P.B.S. \u201cThe Killers\u201d series, \u201cCancer: The Cell That Won't Die.\u201d It will be broadcast on WNYC\u2010TV on March 13, 14 and 17, but the special screening arrangements on the decoded sets have not been determined.Gallaudet College for the Deaf, in Washington, will evaluate the reactions of the audiences with hearing impairments at the viewing sites to the captioning of television in this manner.According to P.B.S. sources, if the experiment is deemed successful, it is expected to lead to routine closed captioning of all national programing on both commercial and public television and to mass production of the decoders.Stations ListedOther stations participating in the test are KLRN, Austin, Tex.; KOAP, Portland, Ore.; KTWU, Topeka, Kan.; WETA, Washington; KCET, Los Angeles; KSPS, Spokane, Wash.; KRMA, Denver; WJCT, Jacksonville, Fla., WMAA, Jackson, Miss.; WEDH, Hartford, and KTCA, St. Paul.Actually, two different technical systems using the decoder will be tested, and one of the purposes of the experiment will be to compare them.An organization called CHEAR (the International Foundation for Children's Hearing Education and Research) has estimated that there are nearly 20 million people in the United States with hearing defects.In light of this, P.B.S. sources believe there will be a sufficient market for the decoders and that this will make captioning a necessary addition to the American television system.The closed\u2010captioning systems were orginally developed by the National Bureau of Standards and Hazeltine Research, Inc., and were later refined by P.B.S."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/13/archives/santatalks-to-deaf-with-sign-language.html", "headline": "Santa \u2018Talks\u2019 to Deaf With Sign Language", "date": "1973-12-13T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from December 13, 1973,  Page 99Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Praeger, a civil engineer and innovator of design concepts, died today at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, L. I. He was 81 years old and lived at 104 Grosvenor Street in Douglaston, Queens.Mr. Praeger was named \u201cMetropolitan Engineer of the Year\u201d in 1953 for his conception and design of Grace Line Pier 57 on the Hudson River. In World War II he designed a breakwater for use in the Allied invasion of Normandy. He also served as a consulting engineer in the renovation of the White House.The most revolutionary feature of the West Side pier was the use of three reinforced concrete boxes as the substructure. The buoyancy of the boxes, constructed in West Haverstraw, N. Y., and towed down the river for sinking and installation at their permanent location, carried a large proportion of the pier's dead weight.Made Parks StudyWhen Robert Moses was Commissioner of Parks during the administration of Fiorello H. La Guardia, he retained Mr. \u201c.,Praeger to do a complete study of all the parks in the city. The voluminous report formed the basis for thousands of improve\u2010, ments subsequently performed. In 1933, Commissioner Moses appointed him to the post of chief engineer for the Department of Parks.Mr. Praeger, who graduated from Erasmus Hall High School, attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he played varsity football. In World War I he was a lieutenant in the Navy.In 1929, he became assistant chief engineer of the CurtissWright Airport Corporation, working on a $200\u2010million program involving designs for 20 airports in principal cities.In the mid\u2010thirties, Mr. Praeger joined the firm of MadiganHyland to coordinate work on a proposed extension of the West Side Highway. Serving as chief engineer, he was also involved in many projects in connection with the city's parkway system.In World. War II, he went to Washington as design manager of the Navy's Bureau of Yards and Docks and was commissioned a Commander and later a Captain. As senior officer in charge of all civilian and military design, he was a member of the committee named to implement Winston Churchill's idea of protected harbors for the invasion of Europe.Mr. Praeger's design of rectangular floating concrete breakwaters, whose code name was \u201cPhoenix,\u201d was accepted, and they were constructed in England and floated across the English Channel to form a protected harbor for the landing and supply operations in Normandy.After the war, Mr. Praeger served as a senior member of the Navy group studying the effects of atomic bombs and aerial weapons in Japan. He was awarded the Legion of Merit.Mr. Praeger used another adaptation of the concrete boxes when he designed the Tappan Zee Bridge spanning the Hudson River at Tarrytown, N. Y. He was responsible for structural engineering for the General Assembly, Meeting Hall and underground parking garage of the United Nations. He also was a consultant on the pier and anchorage foundations for the VerrazanoNarrows Bridge, as well as approaches to and main span of the Throgs Neck Bridge.He is survived by his widow, the former Edna Quinn; a son, Richard Q.: a daughter, Mrs. Elizabeth Branigan, and 13 grandchildren.Other Obituaries, Page 50."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/03/archives/theyre-all-deaf-but-as-a-family-they-dont-feel-handicapped-read-a.html", "headline": "They're All Deaf but, as a Family, They Don't Feel Handicapped", "date": "1973-10-03T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from October 3, 1973,  Page 34Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

For this is the home of Mr. and Mrs. Albert Hlibok (pronounced LIEbock) and they and their four children are deaf.But aside from the strategically placed lights and a teletypewriter attachment to the telephone, this could be the home of any family. A childwith normal hearing comes from across the street to play with 6\u2010year\u2010old Gregory; the television set in the livingroom has the sound turned on (two other TV sets are upstairs), in the attic are model trains, in the basement an electrified workshop; and 2\u2010year\u2010old Nancy has the run of the house\u2014although if she falls and hurts herself, no one can hear her cry out.The family, aside from little Nancy, also lead a full and active life outside the home. Mrs. Hlibok, who has a degree in sociology from Gallaudet College in Washington, D. C., is in organizations attached to nearby St. Andrew's Roman Catholic Church. Mr. Hlibok, who has a degree in civil engineering from Manhattan College and is with McKee\u2010Berger\u2010Mansueto Inc., engineering consultants, goes on business trips alone and often has to attend technical meetings.Thirteen\u2010year\u2010old Bruce goes to Horace Mann school in the Bronx\u2014until last year he attended regular classes at P.S. 107 in Flushing\u2014and this fall two of his younger brothers, 6\u2010year\u2010old Gregory and 101/2\u2010year\u2010old Steve, started at P.S. 107.(All three boys got their earliest education at Lexington School for the Deaf and, according to Dr. Leo Connor, executive director of that institution, were in a superior I.Q. class.)Still, despite the impressive and admirable way in which the Hliboks have risen above their handicap, the question anyone is almost sure to ask is whether the parents, after their first child was born deaf, had reason to think that subsequent children would also lack the ability to hear, and whether they wanted more children even if they were likely to be deaf.These questions were answered recently when Mr. Hlibok took a few minutes out from his work in the cost estimating and project management depattment at McKee\u2010Berger\u2010Mansueto.There was no reason to believe that the children were destined to be born without the ability to hear, he said, and he and his wife had no idea what the odds were. \u201cWe simply knew that we wanted four children, regardless.\u201dDr. Connor, in a separate interview, said that heredity was a vital factor. If the deaf parents had had genetic counseling, he said, they would have known that after their first child was born deaf, the chances of deafness went up geometrically for each succeeding child.Dr. Connor also pointed out that \u201cin the last 10 years, a good pediatrician could have told the parents there was a 75 per cent chance that their next child would be born deaf.\u201d(This would have been after the Hliboks had had Bruce and Steve.)\u201cStill,\u201d Dr. Connor went on, \u201cit is in the last five years that the really great strides have been made in genetic counseling.\u201d Then he said, \u201cBut, even with this advance, there is still no genetic counseling in New York specifically for the deaf. The nearest place to get it is Washington, D.C.\u201dIt is when one visits the Hlibok home that one comes to believe that the counseling would not have made much difference. Albert and Peggy Hlibok wanted four children and they were convinced that they could give them enough warmth and love and security and opportunity to make up for the lack of one of the five senses.Indeed, they are aware that the family probably would not be as closely knit as it is if one child had normal hearing. \u201cNow we all have the same problem; it keeps us together,\u201d said Mr. Hlibok.Everyone except the baby can read lips\u2014that is how TV can be enjoyed\u2014and everyone has mastered speech after a fashion. For instance, when 6\u2010year\u2010old Gregory pointed out to a visitor what was on the TV screen, he sounded as if he were saying \u201c\u201cPappy,\u201d when it was \u201cPopeye.\u201d But Mr. Hlibok speaks plainly enough for Charles Corbo, co\u2010worker at McKee=Berger\u2010Mansueto, to say, \u201cWhen Al talks it sounds to me like someone with a very bad cold.\u201dRead a Visitor's LipsBoth parents are ambitious for themselves and for their children; life is not going to defeat them simply because they cannot hear; and when Albert and Peggy Hlibok had difficulty in reading a visitor's lips recently, they immediately asked the Lexington School for the Deaf to give them a refresher course in lip\u2010reading; they are also going to take more speech training. Little Nancy has been going to the school to continue her Baby Crib program for auditory and speech training.When 5\u2010year\u2010old Jimmy comes from across the street to play with Gregory they use what Mr. Hlibok calls \u201chomemade sign language.\u201d And some of the other neighbors are friendly. For instance, one next door will come over and tell Mrs. Hlibok when her husband is to work late at the office. (The neighbor has been telephoned by someone at McKee\u2010Berger\u2010Mansueto.)But it is at McKee\u2010Berger\u2010Mansueto headquarters on Park Avenue that one finds an atmosphere of respect, helpfulness, understanding and genuine friendship surrounding Mr. Hlibok. When he is at his office \u2014 he has a private one \u2014 he goes to lunch with the other men. \u201cJust like anybody else,\u201d said his co\u2010worker, Charles Corbo.\u201cIn fact,\u201d said Mr. Corbo, \u201c'we forget that Al is deaf. Once he and I and another man were on an out\u2010oftown business trip and we were to stay in the same hotel room. When the other man and I came in late, Al was asleep and we didn't want to wake him so we were undressing as quietly as we could. Then we remembered that he couldn't hear us no mat ter how much noise we made and we had a good laugh.\u201dOf the business trips that Mr. Hlibok goes on alone, Mr. Corbo said, \u201cHe evidently manages just fine; we've never had a complaint from a client.\u201dWhen the whole family was gathered in the living room the other day and the parents were asked what annoys them most in the attitudes of those who can hear, they looked at each other, and then Mr. Hlibok said, \u201cNot sharing; the deaf don't know how to give; the hearing don't know how to share.\u201dWith Mrs. Hlibok nodding in agreement, he went on to say, this time in writing, \u201cThose who can hear tend to make decisions for those who cannot, instead of informing them first and getting opinions.\u201d\u201cImpatience is back of this, of course,\u201d said Mr. Hlibok. \u201cIt takes more time to be patient than impatient.\u201d Then he hastened to add, \u201cBut at my office none of my co\u2010workers are impatient.\u201dWhat he wants for all deaf children is \u201cthe freedom to explore, to express' themselves and make decisions the same as hearing children do. No one should be over\u2010protective of them. They have got to learn to stand up to life and take it as it comes.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/12/archives/chrysler-and-mitsubishi-set-japanese-sales-deal.html", "headline": "Chrysler and Mitsubishi Set Japanese Sales Deaf", "date": "1973-09-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from September 12, 1973,  Page 69Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Dobelle, assistant director of the university's Institute of Biomedical Engineering, presented his work yesterday at a meeting of the American Otological Society in St. Louis.The ear is a tiny system consisting of a microphone and a subminiature electronic computer connected with auditory areas of the brain.Mr. Dobelle said development of the ear required \u201csimultaneous demonstration of its feasibility in three areas.\u201dFirst, he said, electrical stimulation of the human brain had to be shown to produce sensations of sound.\u201cThis has been confirmed in human volunteers who require brain surgery for other problems, including removal of tumors,\u201d Mr. Dobelle said. \u201cLoudness can be easily regulated but considerable work remain: to be done on controlling pitch.\u201dSecond, he said, \u201cone must demonstrate that implantatior of foreign bodies and continu ous electrical stimulation of the brain do not damage the audi tory area or surrounding centers.\u201dThird, Mr. Dobelle said, re searchers had to demonstrate engineering feasibility a reasonable cost. He predictec that devices might eventually be produced for less the $3,000.While experiments so fai have been limited to only brie receptions of electronic tone by humans and longer \u201chear ing\u201d by animals, Mr. Dobelli predicted that the ear woulc eventually be used to restore acceptable normal hearing ti the totally deaf.But he added that, while work on the ear had beer encouraging, it might be year before such devices were avail able for the public."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/26/archives/acupuncture-is-used-to-help-some-victims-of-nerve-deafness-no.html", "headline": "Acupuncture Is Used to Help Some Victims of Nerve Deafness", "date": "1973-02-26T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from February 26, 1973,  Page 20Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Kao, professor of physiology at Downstate Medical Center and editor of the, journal.Dr. Kao said the journal would strive both to report the physiological bases of Chinese medical techniques and to present the philosophical aspects.The report on nerve deafness, by Dr. Alfred Peng of Columbia's anesthesiology department, involved 10 American patients who had been deaf from five to 31 years. After anywhere from two to 14 treatments, five patients were said to be cured or considerably improved and three were moderately improved. Two patients showed no improvement.No Conclusions DrawnOne case involved a 53\u2010year\u2010old woman who had been almost totally deaf for 29 years. After 14 acupuncture treatments, she now has only an 80 per cent hearing loss. Dr. Peng rated this as moderate improvement.Before treatment she had been able to hear only, very loud sounds with a hearing aid.

Established five years ago, it aims to offer new nourishing forms of theater.David Hays, its managing director, said yesterday that the theater company would not perform at Mr. Brook's International Center, but \u201cwork under laboratory conditions there.\u201d\u201cWe are the first company to be invited,\u201d Mr. Hays explained, adding that about $15,000 will be needed to support the joint venture.Queried in Paris, Mr. Brook said that his center \u201cis happy to invite the National Theater of the Deaf to participate in an intensive period of work together with us.\u201d\u201cThis takes its place in the main line of the center's activities, which are to explore those forms of theater which, unaffected by national and social barriers, communicate with us directly,\u201d he said.The Parisian research center, according to Mr. Brook, is not a theater, but \u201ca big theater laboratory, a place for preparation.\u201d The British director said that his invitation to Mr. Hays was the direct result of his seeing the American company last January when he was here for his production of \u201cA Midsummer Night's Dream.\u201d\u201cThe marriage of the two companies is a perfect example of the concern with fundamental essences of theater as a communication,\u201d he said.New Broadway ComedySolar Theater, Inc. the new organization established last June by 32 stage and film performers to provide \u201cquality theater,\u201d will be represented on Broadway this season.It will participate in the production of \u201cPromenade All!, a new comedy by David Robison, which will be co\u2010produced by Fred Coe, Arthur Cantor and Charles Taubman. Solar will receive a percentage of the profits. After a nine\u2010week pre\u2010New York tour and eight local previews, the comedy will open here April 11 costarring Hume Cronyn, Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson.Solar's sharing in, the comedy's profit is by virtue of the membership of its three costars in the new theater organization. Solar also hopes to function in films, television and other forms of entertainment.\u201cPromenade All!, was tested last summer by Mr. Coe by arrangement with Solar at Stockbridge, Mass.; Nyack, N. Y.; Westport, Conn.; Corning N.Y., N. Y., and Falmouth, Mass. Arthur Storch has been engaged to direct the comedy on Broadway. The work is described as \u201ca light\u2010hearted look at four periods of American life over an 80\u2010year period.\u201dTwo Shows BookedTwo new Off Broadway shows were announced yesterday for February production: \u201cBrothers,\u201d by Stephen White, has been booked to open at Theater Four on Feb. 13 under the sponsorship of White Caps Productions \u201cTwo if by Sea,\u201d a musical by Tony Hutchins and Priscilla Dewey, will be unveiled at the Circle\u2010in\u2010theSquare on Feb. 6.

Steve L. Mathis 3d of Baltimore, president of the conference, preached the ser mon. The 41\u2010year\u2010old Episcopal priest lost his hearing at the age of 12 following a football injury.Church Is a LandmarkThe celebrant and host to the convention was the Rev. Rog er Pickering, the vicar of St; Stephen's. The little gray church, on South 10th Street between Market and Chestnut streets, is a landmark certified by the Philadelphia Historical Commission as the site where Benjamin Franklin flew his fa vious kite.Father Pickering, 40, became deaf from scarlet fever at the age of six. He attended West ern Pennsylvania School for the Deaf in Pittsburgh and the Michigan School for the Deaf in Flint.His wife, Sandra, a hearing person who holds a degree in special education for the deaf, works closely whith him.The Episcopal Church was the first religious body to or dain a deaf man and now has 10 deaf priests in its full\u2010time ministry.According to Mrs. Pickering, there are no ordained deaf clergy in the Roman Catholic Church or in Judaism.

Nineteen other persons were in jured.The two young men were with a group of 41 students of the School for Deaf Mutes in Jacksonville, Ill., who came here to attend a basketball game. Twelve of the youngsters were injured. All the students were housed in rooms adjacent to the blaze.Fire Commissioner Robert J. Quinn identified the two dead students as Don Zanger of Quincy, Ill., and Bruce Kennedy of Morton Grove, Ill., both 18 years old.The commissioner said that the youths apparently did not hear hotel employes who had rapped on doors and evacuated patrons soon after the fire was reported at 7 A. M. central standard time.\u201cThey never had a chance,\u201d Mr. Quinn added. \u201cThe smoke got to them before we opened the door.\u201dSome DifficultyOfficials said that firemen who led the surviving students from the hotel had some diffi culty because the students could not understand spoken orders.Hospital authorities said that the injured suffered from smoke inhalation, burns or cuts.The fire was confined to an elevator shaft at the ninth floor but officials said that smoke wafted to the top floor of the 25\u2010story building. Commissioner Quinn estimated the damage at $150,000.Hundreds of guests fled from their rooms through fire escapes or interior stairways. Many were clad in nightclothes.Mr. Quinn said that the fire started in some furniture stored near the elevator shaft but ho tel officials declined to com ment on the cause of the fire.The Hilton, a 3,000 \u2010 room building in downtown Chicago, was used in 1968 as the head quarters for delegates to the Democratic National Conven tion."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/12/archives/deaf-youths-lend-a-hand-to-neediest-deaf-youths-dismiss-own-woes-to.html", "headline": "Deaf Youths Lend a Hand To Neediest", "date": "1970-01-12T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from January 12, 1970,  Page 56Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them.Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.The virtue of simplicity in screen narration is put to clear and eloquent use in the little British film \"The Story of Mandy,\" which came to the Sutton yesterday. Unpretentious and almost documentary in its telling of a tense dramatic tale of a husband and wife's estrangement over the training of their deaf-mute child, it opens a straight, revealing vista into the heart of a problem of this sort and makes pretty vivid the anxieties and the sensations of all involved.Although the drama is essentially that of the husband and wife and of their sharply conflicting notions of what to do for their afflicted child, it actually revolves about the presence and the reactions of this little girl as she responds to the strange doings of adults and the sensitive guidance of a specialized school. And, thanks to the wonderful performance that Director Alexander Mackendrick gets from Mandy Miller, a remarkably fluent child, the rewarding development of this youngster makes the crux and suspense of the film.With a script by Nigel Balchin and Jack Whittingham, based upon a novel by Hilda Lewis, \"The Day Is Ours,\" Mr. Mackendrick has traced the poignant aspects of congenital deafness in a child from the point at which the parents first realize that their infant is unable to hear through the moment of indicated triumph when the 6-year-old youngster speaks her name. He has marked out with sharp illumination those typical and critical steps in the training of the child, when she makes her difficult contacts with other children and responds to the patient and dramatic help of trained teachers. And the climax in the progress of the youngster in her discovery of the technique of making sounds is reached with a beautiful and tenderly revealing succession of dramatic scenes.Though naturally outshone by little Miss Miller, to whom all hearts inevitably turn, the adult performers in this picture merit full appreciation, too. Phyllis Calvert is most credibly expressive of the emotions of the mother of the child, from initial despair and frustration to eventual hope and confidence. Terence Morgan gives a clear interpretation of the father whose skeptical and repressive attitudes are obviously the consequence of his submission to his own possessive mother, whom Marjorie Fielding plays. Jack Hawkins as the brusque but competent master of a school for deaf-mute tots and Edward Chapman as a difficult trustee also are interestingly volatile.Perhaps the script writers might have fashioned a little more penetrating plot if they had used a device less obvious than the suggestion of an illicit amour between the mother of the child and the school-master to disturb the atmosphere. But it may be that they have thereby given their story more popular appeal, which may bring more people to see it. If so, they may fairly be excused, for this picture, with its forthright appraisal of realities, deserves to be widely seen. It stands up alongside the American film, \"The Quiet One,\" as a penetration of the difficult world of the non-normal child.THE STORY OF MANDY, screen play by Nigel Balchin and Jack Whittingham, based on the novel. \"The Day Is Ours.\" by Hilda Lewis; directed by Alexander Mackendrick.

It is a charmingly poetic idea that has received tasteful and reverend attention from John Adolfi the director. Mr. Arliss delivers another of-his effective and meticulous portrayals as a celebrated pianist named Montgomery Royale, who is afflicted with deafness and subsequently finds joy in eavesdropping on distressed souls in Central Park by reading their lips through powerful field glasses as they talk to each other.It is a neatly conceived story as it comes to the screen, with effervescent cheer in the introductory sequences, then a period of melancholy, and finally episodes of thankfulness and happiness. It was no wonder that this first night audience, after watching and listening in silence throughout the production, were stirred to applaud as Royale sat at a church organ and played \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\"This beguiling tale was written years ago by Gouverneur Morris and it was dramatized by Jules Eckert Goodman. A good deal has been added to it in transforming it into a film and while it seems a little lethargic at times, it has such a genuinely gentle and appealing touch that one would not wish it to be told any faster.There are the glimpses of Paris, with Mr. Royale suffering from too much adulation from those who enjoy his piano playing. Grace, a young girl, is infatuated with this elderly musician and she watches his nimble fingers through her field glass as he plays. He discourages Grace from loving him, but she worships music and therefore adores this master of the piano.In a beautifully staged series of scenes Royale is beheld ready to play before a king\u00f4which king is not stated. This monarch is delayed, and Royale decides that the concert must start. He plays and receives an ovation, and after the concert is over and Royale is holding a reception in a private room, in comes the king. He had been held up by a breakdown of his automobile. Through dark shadows one appreciates that something alarming is going to happen, and immediately after Royale sits at the piano to play especially for the king a bomb is thrown through the window of the room. Apparently nobody is hurt, but the shock of the explosion destroys the musician's hearing. He is dumfounded by the sudden stillness and there is an affecting glimpse when, after a valiant attempt to play again, he arises from the piano and realizes that he is deaf.The once jolly Royale becomes sour and gloomy. He will not play another note and he returns to New York filled with bitterness against God. He countermands the order for an organ he was going to give to a church in memory of his mother and he smashes a violin. He even thinks of suicide, but he is stayed from this by his faithful servant, Battle, acted by Ivan Simpson. Royale keeps to his apartment, but one day an expert on lip-reading comes to him and the pianist turns out to be an apt pupil. As soon as Royale learns to understand what persons are saying he becomes more cheerful and then one day he chances to observe Grace's field glasses on a window seat.He looks down into Central Park and reads the lips of a young man who has been told that he has consumption and must go away. The girl with him is willing to sell herself to her employer to raise the money to help cure the man she loves. Royale hurries Battle out after the couple, and just after they have finished praying Royale's servant appears with an envelope and they read the note it contains. It asks for their address so that the writer can send the money needed to make them happy.Royale mocks God even at this stage, saying that he is himself answering their prayers. But subsequent events change his demeanor. He does not confine himself to aiding grown-ups, but also sends toys to poor little children, and during one scene Royale and Battle are perceived having a rollicking time while trying out and packing the presents.Besides Mr. Arliss's masterful acting, there is an excellent performance by Violet Heming, who appears as Royale's sincere and sympathetic friend. Bette Davis, who plays Grace, often speaks too rapidly for the microphone. Mr. Simpson and Louise Closser Hale do splendidly in their respective r\u00f4les.It was a pity that the print screened last night was often extremely noisy in the first stages. The undertones sounded as though a thunderstorm were going on in the distance.Prior to the presentation of \"The Man Who Played God,\" there was shown a special film called \"Washington, the Man and the Capitol.\"The Deaf Pianist.THE MAN WHO PLAYED GOD, based on a story by Gouverneur Morris and a play by Jules Eckert Goodman; directed by John Adolfi; produced by Warner Brothers.

It will be seen from it that the quantity of land disposed of during the last fiscal year, for cash, by the location of bounty land warrants, as swamp and overflowed land, for railroad purposes, and under the Homestead Law, was 2,966,698.43 acres, as against 1,377,922 acres disposed of during the previous fiscal year, and during the first quarter of the present fiscal year 874,850.66 acres, making the entire quantity thus disposed of during the period named 3,841,549.09 acres. The increase arises chiefly from the operation of the Homestead Law, under; which alone 1,456,514.96 acres were taken up since the 1st of January, 1863, when it took effect.The revenue derived from the sale of the public lands during the last fiscal year amounted to $136,077 95, being an increase of $11,029 65 over the previous fiscal year. During the quarter ending 30th September last the sales amounted to $90,060 55, which is $77,662 59 more than was realized during the quarter ending Sept. 30, 1862. The rapid increase now observable in the sales of the public lands affords additional evidence of the entire confidence of the people in the stability of the Government, and that the industrial resources of the nation have not been materially diminished, notwithstanding the immense armies it has placed in the field.No subject committed to the management of this department is of greater importance than that of the public lands, nor has any been more prolific of legislation. Congress, at an early period, recognized the expediency and importance of the speedy settlement of the public domain, and of a liberal policy toward the actual settler. The prudence and wisdom of the system thus early inaugurated, and which has finally culminated in the enactment of the Homestead Law, are attested by the vast extent of fertile country which has been reclaimed and formed into now populous and flourishing States, which contribute of the superabundance of their agricultural and mineral productions to the necessities of the earlier settled portions of the country and to foreign nations.The progress being made in the gigantic experiment of a railway to unite still more closely the States on the Atlantic to those on the Pacific will soon attract settlements along its entire route, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office, with wise forecast, has, with the approbation of the department, slightly increased the usual surveying estimates, in order to meet the exigencies which will thus be created.In order to obtain the benefits of the Act of May 20, 1863. \"to secure homesteads to actual settlers on the public domain,\" certain preliminary acts are required to be performed before the Register or Receiver for the district of lands in which the settlement is proposed to be made by the party applying in person. This requirement of the law is thought to operate invidiously toward persons who ere engaged in the military and naval service of the United States, and, to remedy the evil, it is respectfully suggested that the law might, with propriety, be so far modified as to permit the wife or other proper representative of a person so employed in the public service to take the preliminary steps for the legal inception of his claim. I also concur in the opinion expressed by the Commissioner of Public Lands, that it is expedient and proper to require persons claiming the benefits of this law to pay she full commissions of the Register and Receiver at the time the entry is made, instead of deferring the payment of one-half thereof until the final issue of the certificate at the end of five years.At the time of the discovery of the great mineral wealth of portions of the public domain the nation was in the enjoyment of domestic tranquillity and unrivaled prosperity, and could well afford to throw open her rich mines of precious metals to the unrestricted enterprise of the world; but having now been forced into a war for the preservation of our national existence, as unexampled in expense as in magnitude, the question whether we can, in justice to other branches of industry and enterprise, longer exempt this immense source of individual revenue from its equitable share of the public burden becomes of much importance. A small tax upon the net profits of the gold mines of the United States would largely increase the means of the Treasury; and as no good reason seems to exist why the nation should not, in its hour of need, derive some direct assistance from its extensive fields of gold and silver mines, I earnestly press the consideration of the subject with a view to that end.The attention of Congress is also called to the necessity of providing a law for the appointment of a Surveyor-General, and the establishment of a District Land Office in the Territory of Idaho.In view of the disturbing causes that have existed, our relations with the various Indian tribes are as favorable as could reasonably be expected. The experience of the past few years, however, clearly demonstrates the necessity of important changes in the policy hitherto pursued toward them.While the regions of country occupied by the Indians remained uninhabited by the whites, the plan of setting apart separate reservations for different bands of the same tribe, or for small tribes possessing similar habits and customs, and privileged to roam over common hunting-grounds in quest of the means of subsistence, as in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas and Nebraska, seemed wise and to promise success; but as the country becomes settled, their dependence upon same and the spontaneous productions of the earth become more and more precarious, while the necessity for their keeping within the limits of their reservations increases. The Indians are thus left without their accustomed resources, and in the midst of a population with whose customs and arts of life they are wholly unfamiliar. They consequently become discouraged, and, looking solely to their scanty annuities from the Government, or to begging and pilfering for the necessaries of life, fall an easy prey to the sharpers and whisky-traders who gather around their reservations for the purpose of obtaining their moneys.The smaller the reservation the greater are the facilities for the exercise of this pernicious influence, and hence the necessity of concentrating scattered bands and the smaller tribes of similar habits, language and customs, into as large communities as possible, and their location upon the more remote portions of the public domain. They will soon become extinct unless they acquire the arts of civilized life, and to this end it is indispensably necessary to place them beyond the reach of any influence save that of their agents, teachers and assistants. The vast emigration to the newly-discovered gold-bearing regions of the interior has brought us into more immediate contact with large and powerful tribes, with whom no treaties other than those of amity have yet been negotiated, and all the energies which the department can possibly exert in that direction will scarcely be adequate to the pressing demands that will be made upon it during the next few years by the exigencies of the Indian service in those regions.Immediate steps should be taken to prevent collision between them and our own people, to provide suitable locations for the Indians, and to induce them to settle upon them and engage in the cultivation of the soil and the rearing of domestic animals, and in the meantime to furnish them such supplies as may be absolutely necessary to prevent starvation. The number of Indians under the direct supervision of the department is thus rapidly becoming larger than at any former period, and the wisdom of anticipating this increased demand upon its resources by a corresponding increase in the appropriations for the Indian service, whether we are to be guided by the principles of justice and humanity, or economy, must be manifest to all.Particular attention is also invited to the condition of Indian affairs in California. That State has hitherto been divided into two districts -- the Northern and the Southern -- each under the charge of a superintending agent. There is no good reason for continuing this arrangement, and on the score of economy alone it ought to be abolished, and our Indian relations throughout the State placed under the control of a single Superintendent.The good of the service and the future welfare of the Indians also imperatively demand the establishment of two reservations in the northern part of the State -- one near the coast, and the other in the interior -- of sufficient extent for the accommodation of all the Indians in what is designated as the Northern District, and at least one suitable reservation for those in the southern portion of the State. The necessity for these different reservations arises from the great dissimilarity that exists in the habits and customs of the several tribes for whom they are intended.The hostility of the powerful tribes of the Apaches and Navajoes, mainly located in New-Mexico and Arizona, is such, that for the present their management must be left chiefly to the military branch of the Government, but measures should be promptly taken for the establishment of suitable reservations for the other Indians in those Territories, and for those now in hostility to the United States, whenever they shall have been properly subdued.The unfortunate result of the effort made last Spring to return the refugee Cherokees to their homes has largely added to the number of refugees and greatly increased the expense of their subsistence. This, together with the advance in the prices of clothing and provisions, has so augmented the expense of providing for them as to exhaust the funds set apart for that purpose, and renders a further appropriation necessary. It is doubtful whether the supplies needed could, even now, be forwarded in time to prevent much suffering, and hence the importance of as early action by Congress in the premises as may be practicable.The able report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs will be found to be replete with interesting facts and judicious suggestions on the subjects to which it relates.The number of Revolutionary soldiers borne upon the pension-rolls has dwindled to 18 on the 30th of June last, of whom only 10 had made application for their stipends on the 4th of March. The number of widows of Revolutionary soldiers on the rolls at the same period was 1,573. The whole number of army invalid pensioners on the rolls on June 30 was 7,248, most of whom were pensioned on account of wounds received or disease contracted in the service during the present war. The widows, orphans and dependent mothers of 3,573 deceased soldiers of the present war were inscribed upon the rolls during the last fiscal year, making the whole number of this class on the rolls at the close of the year 4,820. The number of navy invalids on the rolls at the close of the year was 544, and the number of widows, orphans and dependent mothers of deceased officers and seamen of the navy, 577. The whole number of army pensioners added to the rolls during the last fiscal year was 7,582, and of the navy 316. The number of army pensioners, of all classes, on the rolls on the 30th of June last was 13,659, and of the navy 1,132. The payment of the former requires the sum of $1,227,641 88, and the latter $144,074 61 per annum.The remittances to the agents for paying pensions have been so regulated according to law \"as to prevent an undue accumulation of balances in their hands.\"During the year 602 bounty land warrants have been issued, calling, in the aggregate, for 94,280 acres of land.It appears from the Commissioner's Report that the whole amount of money expended by the Government for pensions to the close of the last fiscal year was $91,693,660 97, and that the quantity of land granted for military and naval services was 65,896,142 acres, which, at $1 25 per acre, would amount to $82,370,177 50.Congress at the last session provided for an increase of clerical force at the Pension Office, and I am happy in being able to say that it has enabled the Commissioner to dispose of the greatly increased amount of business thrown upon it with satisfactory promptitude. During the first quarter of the present fiscal year, 7,162 claims were admitted, and a much larger number examined and suspended for further evidence.The Commissioner estimates the whole number of claims that will be admitted during the present fiscal year at about 30,000.The appointment of surgeons, as authorized by the act of July 14, 1862, to make the biennial examinations of pensioners, and to examine applicants for invalid pensions, has been attended with marked advantage and saving to the Government. For the information of the public, and those more immediately interested, the Commissioner has embraced in his report the names of the surgeons thus appointed in the several States, with their Post-office address.The act of 3d March, 1859, requiring the biennial examination of invalid pensioners, prescribes that the examinations shall be made by two surgeons or physicians. The Commissioner is of the opinion, in which I concur, that the examination will be as satisfactorily made by a single surgeon, regularly appointed by the office, and with less inconvenience to the parties interested, and a modification of the law in this respect is, therefore, recommended.The increase of the Navy Pension Fund from the sale of prizes amounts, at the present time, to probably $1,500,000.The old laws in elation to the Navy Pension Fund seems to authorize and require the investment of this money; but as the question is not entirely free from doubt, I recommend the passage of a law authorizing the Department to invest the amount which has been and may hereafter be derived by the sale of prizes in Government bonds, and apply the interest thereon to the payment of navy pensions, or that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized by law to credit this fund with the interest, which would semiannually accrue thereon, if so invested.A decision has been given by the Department in a case arising under the act of July 14, 1862, and as it will furnish a rule of action for the Pension Bureau, in constantly recurring cases of a like character, I beg leave to refer to it specially.The second, third and fourth sections of that act make provision for the widow, children, dependent mother, or orphan sisters, as the case may be, of any officer or other person named in the first section who has died since the 4th day of March, 1861, or who shall thereafter die by reason of any wound received or disease contracted while in the service of the United States, and in the line of duty. An officer of the navy had contracted, under these circumstances, a disease of which he died. Some months previous to his death he tendered his resignation, as his declining health, impaired by disease, which ultimately proved fatal, incapacitated him for the efficient discharge of duty. His resignation was accepted. The claim of his widow for a pension was rejected in the Pension Office solely upon the ground that he was not, at the time of his death, in the naval service of the United States. The case was, by appeal, brought before the Department.The action of the Pension Bureau conformed to the construction which had been given to preceding acts of Congress granting naval pensions. Some of these acts expressly confined the right of the claimed to cases when the death of the officer occurred during the period of his service. Other acts, such as that of 1813, and the second section of the act of 1814, secure the beneficiaries, for a specific period, half of the monthly pay to which the deceased was entitled at the time of his death. The late Attorney-General BUTLER decided that the death of an officer or seaman before the expiration of his service was not essential, under the latter acts, to the validity of his widow's claim to a pension. He subsequently withdrew that opinion, and, although considering such a claim within the general equity of the system, he came to a conclusion adverse to it under those acts, owing to their peculiar phraseology, and from the fact that Congress had given a construction to them by the continuing acts of May 23, 1828, and June 28, 1832.The act of 1862 does not, in direct terms, exclude from its benefits the widow or other designated relatives of persons, who, after their resignation or discharge, shall die of wounds received or disease contracted in the naval service, and in the line of duty, nor does it determine the amount of pension by the monthly pay of the deceased at the time of his death. The latter provision would seem to require that the connection of the deceased with the service should subsist until his death. By the uniform practice of the Pension Bureau, under the existing act, a military pension was granted to the relatives of the party without regard to the time of his death, if the claim in other respects was free from objection. Uniformity in the administration of the act is desirable, and a settled interpretation of it should be adhered to unless it be manifestly wrong. Although, in the former legislation of Congress, military and naval pensions were granted under separate and independent enactments, both classes of pensions are provided for and placed upon the same footing by the act under consideration. No distinction is made between the two branches of the service. I could not sanction a decision making such a distinction, and I was satisfied that the action of the Pension Bureau, in regard to military pensions, was amply justified by the spirit, and not in violation of the letter, of the statute.The effects and consequences of the opposite construction are worthy of attention. According to it, no provision is made for the bereaved and often necessitous and helpless family of a deceased party who has received a mortal wound or contracted a fatal disease in the line of duty, if his death occurred after the expiration of the period of his service. Had the wound or disease inflicted a disability, it is clear that, had he survived it, he would have been entitled to a pension proportionate to such disability. The pension would not commence in any event until after his discharge. Should the disabled and discharged soldier or seaman die after receiving his pension, or before establishing his claim to it, his relatives would be excluded from the bounty of Congress, although it could be shown by indisputable proofs that his death was the direct and inevitable result of a wound received on the field or the deck from the enemies of his country.It seemed to me to be more in accordance with the legislative intention to [???]ld that the death of a party after his resignation or discharge would not be fatal to the claim of his widow or relatives to a pension.Should I have erred in this view, Congress can apply the appropriate corrective in regard to future cases.I would advise, however, that some limit should be fixed by law, within which the death should occur, to entitle the beneficiaries named in the second and the following sections of the act to the benefit of its provisions.During the year ending Sept. 30 last, 5,133 applications, and 811 caveats were received at the Patent office. Twenty-nine applications were filed for the extension of patents previously granted. During the same period, 3,887 patents were issued, and forty extensions granted. Quite a diminution is observable in the number of claims on which patents have been allowed, but not issued because of the non-payment of the final fee within the time prescribed by law, the number being about 370.The balance in the Treasury to the credit of the patent fund on the 1st of October, 1862, was $48,157 21. The receipts of the office to Sept. 30, 1863, amounted to $179,378 55, making its entire resources for the year $222,535 76. The expenditures of the office during that period have been $189,803 13, leaving a balance on hand on the 1st October, 1863, of $37,732 63.The work of classifying the results of the Eighth Census for publication has progressed satisfactorily, and the printing of the volume of population statistics is so far advanced as to insure its completion and delivery early in the coming session of Congress. The succeeding volume will be supplied to the two Houses as fast as the capabilities of the public printer will admit.The Marshals and Assistant Marshals in the loyal States have generally been paid in full for their services, and the accounts of those employed to take the territorial census of Nevada, Dakota and Colorado, for which provision was made by the act of March 3, 1863, have been paid, in part, and the remainder are in process of adjustment. The final settlement of the accounts of 1,207 Marshals and Assistants in States affected by the rebellion has been precluded by the condition of public affairs and the refusal of some of these officers to take the oath prescribed by law as a condition precedent to payment.The able reports from the Board of Visitors and the Superintendent of Construction of the Government Hospital for the Insane will be read by all with much interest. The advantages of this institution at the present time cannot be over estimated. Those who, while engaged in the land and naval service of the country, in this trying hour, for the preservation of our Government, are overtaken by mental disorders, there find a refuge, and are treated with the highest skill which has yet been attained in the art of treating the insane. The success which has attended their treatment, and the numbers who have recovered, are the most flattering testimonials in behalf of those who have had charge of the institution. Their devotion to their calling is only to be fully appreciated when it is remembered that a larger number of patients have been admitted to this institution during the last year than have ever before been admitted into any similar hospital in this country in the same space of time. Although so large a number have been admitted, and the increase been chiefly derived from the army and navy, it is gratifying to be assured that neither the existence of the war, doubt as to the justice of our cause, nor distrust as to its final result, is to be imputed as the cause of the malady with which the patients have been afflicted, but that it is rather the result of overtasked efforts of constitutions previously impaired by sickness contracted in the line of duty.Among other advantages which this institution affords is that those who have suffered the loss a limb in the service may here have it replaced by an artificial one, fabricated by persons of the highest skill, without cost, the patients being maintained at the hospital, free of expense, during the time the artificial limb is being prepared, made familiar with its mechanism and use, and thus enabled to adopt their new help with the greatest advantage and ease to themselves.During the past year very much difficulty and perplexity have been experienced by the department in the admission of patients to the institution under the present laws. Many applications have been made for admission of persons who have sought refuge in this District, but have not their permanent homes here, so as to be clearly entitled to admission into the hospital as resident paupers at the time of becoming insane. These persons have, in many instances, been a seririous charge upon the War Department, which has been compelled to take care of them in camps and other unsuitable places for such persons, and consequently at great expense and inconvenience.It is recommended that existing laws on the subject be so modified as to permit the department, in the exercise of a proper discretion, to admit this class of persons into the Asylum until they can be more properly disposed of.I cannot conclude my notice of this institution without adding my testimony to that of all my predecessors to the marked devotion and distinguished ability and fitness of the gentleman who has occupied the position of Superintendent from the foundation of the Asylum.He deserves the gratitude of the country for his zealous and persistent efforts to make the institution under his charge a model one in every respect in which it may be viewed.The appropriations which are asked for the ensuing fiscal year are earnestly recommended. No application of public money has ever been more wisely, economically and satisfactorily made than have the sums dedicated by Congress to this humane and benevolent institution.The Columbia Institution for the instruction of the deaf and dumb and the blind has been managed with great ability and success. The buildings, however, are manifestly insufficient for the proper accommodation of the pupils admitted, and the growing wants of this community.The report of the President of the institution will be read with interest. It expresses an earnest desire for the acquisition of more adjacent land -- to the extent of about thirteen acres -- for the instruction of the pupils in horticulture and agriculture; the erection of more permanent and commodious mechanic shops and other necessary buildings, and for the introduction of the Potomac water, and asks for these purposes additional appropriations amounting to about $60,000. If it be the intention of Congress to make this institution a receptacle of all who will probably apply for admission into it, the proposed enlargements are eminently proper, and should be made without delay, in order to secure the requisite lands before they shall have advanced in price or be otherwise appropriated. But if it be only designed to make provision for the unfortunates of this class inhabiting the District of Columbia, and the children of persons in the military and naval service, who are unable to provide for them elsewhere, then it is doubtful whether it will be proper to increase the extent of the grounds, or to construct the buildings as proposed. In either case, however, the wooden structures now appurtenant to the buildings occupied, are entirely unsafe for the purposes to which they are applied, and should be removed, and their places supplied by substantial brick buildings, and about two acres of land added for the purpose of erecting thereon proper workshops.I abstained from submitting the estimates proposed for the larger sums, because I was not prepared to say what the will of Congress might be on the subject; but I earnestly recommend that provision be made, if not to the full extent asked, at least to that required for the proper and safe accommodation of the children of the District, who are entitled to admission into the institution. It should also be supplied with water, and I recommend the appropriation of the amount asked for that purpose.Satisfactory progress has been made on the work of the Capitol extension and new dome, notwithstanding the difficulties encountered in obtaining the marble for the former, and artisans of the requisite skill and experience for the peculiar character of the work to be done on the latter.Since the last Annual Report from this department, the eastern portico of the north wing has been constructed, and much work done on that of the south wing. The porticos of the connecting corridors, and the granite platforms and steps between the old or central portions of the building and the new wings, as well as the approaches to both wings on the western front, have also been completed. It is expected that the eastern entrance to the north wing will also be finished the present season.The group of statuary which was executed here in marble, from models made by the late THOMAS CRAWFORD, for the pediment of the eastern portico of the north wing, designed to represent \"the progress of civilization,\" and the statues of \"Justice\" and \"History,\" which were also designed by CRAWFORD, and executed in Italy, have been put in their respective places, and attract much attention and merited admiration.The expensive and elaborately-wrought bronze door, designed by RANDOLPH ROGERS, and cast at the Bavarian foundry, in Munich, and the marble statues of FRANKLIN and JEFFERSON, executed in Italy by HIRAM POWERS, under a contract made by your immediate predecessor, under the authority of an act of Congress, have also been received and placed in appropriate positions in the building.All these works of art, and a few others not yet completed, were exempted from the restrictions which were imposed upon the embellishment of the Capitol with statuary and painting by the recent legislation of Congress.The colossal figure of \"Freedom,\" designed by CRAWFORD and executed by CLARK MILLS was, on the 2d inst., successfully raised to its elevated place on the new dome, and forms a grand and appropriate crowning to the Capitol of the nation.With a view of economy, during the present year, I abolished the office of architect of the Patent-office building, and added the duties of the same to those of the architect of the Capitol extension. Preparations have been made for finishing the saloon of the north front, and for furnishing the same with suitable cases for the reception and exhibition of models.The work will be completed during the approaching season, and with the appropriation made at the last session of Congress for that purpose. The architect strongly urges the propriety and necessity of completing the exterior of the north front, and an appropriation for that purpose has been submitted in the annual estimates.It became indi[???]pensably necessary for the proper accommodation of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and the offices connected therewith, to make certain changes and improvements in the eastern portion of the City Hall, which I have caused to be made at the expense of the judiciary fund, upon which it has been usual to draw for such purposes, and the Court is now enabled to dispatch the business coming before it with much greater convenience and satisfaction to the public.The report of the Commissioner of Public Buildings will indicate to Congress the alterations and repairs which have been made to the finished portions of the Capitol, and what additional improvements he deems it advisable to have provided for by further legislation. It also explains the manner in which the moneys appropriated for the public works under his charge have been expended during the past year, and recommends other improvements of the streets and public grounds, which recommendations will, no doubt, receive the consideration of the appropriate Committees of Congress.The duties properly appertaining to the office of Commissioner of the Public Printing and Grounds have been greatly augmented within the past few years, and sometimes by the imposition upon him of duties not strictly belonging to his office. In justice to him, therefore, as well as to the public service, at the commencement of the present fiscal year I relieved him to some extent by the appointment of a general superintendent and special disbursing agent for the Capitol extension, the Patent-Office Building, and the Washington Aqueduct. In making this arrangement, a saving to the Government was effected, while I at the same time secured for these important works the services of a professional and practical architect.The work on the Washington aqueduct has progressed, in pursuance of the act of Congress transferring the same to this department, with but slight exceptions, and the water of the Potomac River has been this day introduced into the reservoirs. The walls and banks of the distributing reservoir were designed, by the engineer who projected the aqueduct, to be protected with broken stone, and a contract was made, and the work commenced on that plan; but it appeared to me to be so unsubstantial and insufficient for the purpose, that I caused an inquiry to be made as to the manner of protecting similar embankments in other localities, and found that, with but few if any exceptions, the walls were lined with solid stone masonry, laid in the best of cement. Influenced by the example and experience of others, and by the advice of eminent engineers, I directed a thin dressing of broken stone to be placed upon the interior walls for a foundation, and the whole to be faced with solid stone-work of about the same thickness as the contemplated riprap or broken stone wall. According to the original plan, of the aqueduct, the water from the Potomac is conducted in a receiving reservoir farmed by a dam across a stream called Rock Creek, Powder-mill or Little Falls Branch, about nine miles below the head of the conduit, whence it is conveyed about two miles further clown to a distributing reservoir, divided into two equal sections or basins, by an embankment designed chiefly for filtering purposes. It is thus always intermingled with the water from Rock Creek, Powder Mill Branch. The latter stream drains a considerable extent of country, and is subject to frequent and heavy freshets, which render its water unfit for immediate use. At times this stream is clear, while the water of the Potomac is rendered impure by reason of heavy rains nearer its source. It is, therefore, important that the aqueduct should be so constructed as to afford an adequate supply of water from whichever of these sources may, for the time, be most free from impurities, and to exclude that which may be unfit for use. For this purpose the engineer in charge proposes to connect the conduit above the receiving reservoir with that below it, so that the water from the Potomac may be brought directly into the distributing reservoir without being adulterated by that of Hock Creek, Powder Mill branch. He also proposes to construct a gatehouse in the dividing wall of the distributing reservoir, so as to admit of the use of the water from either section, as may become desirable. By means of these improvements the requisite supply of water may be drawn from whichever of four distinct sources may be the purest and best, viz.: the Potomac River, Rock Creek, Powder Mill branch, or either section of the distributing reservoir; but without some such arrangement \"an unfailing and abundant supply of good and wholesome water\" cannot at all times be obtained. Under these circumstances I have deemed it necessary to order these changes in the original plan, and have made the estimates of appropriations for the completion of the work to conform thereto. For Information in detail in reference to this subject I invite attention to the full and able report of the Chief Engineer.Certain parties having, from time to time, made claim to heavy damages for the diversion of the water from the Potomac River, my immediate predecessor, with a view to settle and end this claim, entered into an agreement of arbitration wtth the claimants. In pursuance of this agreement, the arbitrators met from time to time, and finally submitted their award, by which they adjudged in favor of the claimants upon each and all of the plans and modes submitted to them, being three in number, for the construction of the dam across the Potomac, and also $12,000 for their own fees as arbitrators, and $761 84 for the expenses of arbitration. The sums being so large, I did not feel justified in applying the existing appropriation for the completion of the aqueduct to the payment thereof, preferring to submit the whole matter to Congress for its determination. It appears from the report of the experienced engineer in charge of the work, as must be obvious to every observer, that an ample supply of water for the use of the cities of Washington and Georgetown, for many years to come, can be obtained from the Potomac by the erection of a tight dam, extending from the Maryland shore to Conn's Island, to a hight which will give a head of six feet of water in the aqueduct, and yield a daily supply of about 65,000,000 gallons, which is thirty-three one-third per cent. more than was ever used in the City of New-York in the year 1861, when its population was 800,000. In view of this fact, I have instructed the engineer to construct a dam of cut stone, with a base sufficient to bear a superstructure of the required hight for the full capacity of the aqueduct, whenever it may be called into requisition.It is difficult to conceive how a dam of this character can work any injury to the proprietors of the water right claimed at the Great Falls. At the utmost it could only raise the water to a level at the head of the island, while at ordinary stages and at low water, (the only time when any value can properly be placed on the right,) it would not increase or diminish the flow of water in the main channel on the west side of the island; and it surely cannot be pretended that the parties claiming the water right can lawfully divert the ordinary flow of the water on the east side of the island. A dam of the east channel that would raise the water to a height sufficient to fill the aqueduct would be a great advantage to the claimants, for the reason that it would enable them to avail themselves of the power by the erection of but one dam, while one that would only back the water to the head of the island must be a matter of total iudifference to them; because, in the very nature of things, it can work them no detriment whatever.If this view shall be taken of the case by Congress, I recommend that a reasonable sum be appropriated to pay the expenses of the arbitration, and that the estimate of the cost of the dam across the main channel be diminished to the estimated cost of the dam over the east channel, thus leaving the greater cost of the dam to be provided for as the exigencies of the cities of Washington and Georgetown, by the increase of their population, may require.The report of the Engineer will not fail to arrest the attention of Congress in another important particular.The immense volume of water which the aqueduct will soon furnish will afford an ample supply for fountains at all appropriate places; and for cleansing the streets and sewers of the City, keeping them at all times in a healthful and agreeable condition. But in order to the accomplishment of this most desirable object, the present system of expenditure for the repairing of streets and the construction of sewers must be abandoned or modified to such an extent as to place it under one control. I can perceive no good reason why the Government should take upon itself the exclusive management and repair of one or more of the streets and avenues of the city, while all are equally necessary to the convenience and comfort of the citizens of the United States visiting or residing in the City of Washington. The great width of its numerous streets and avenues quite discourages any attempt to completely pave them, nor is it desirable that it should be generally done, when we consider the increased amount of heat that would be radiated from their exposed surfaces, and the clouds of dust that would be constantly sweeping over them.It is believed that this may be avoided to a great extent, by allowing in some instances the adjoining proprietors to extend their sidewalks into the streets, so as to reduce the latter to a proper width for pavement or concrete and to afford space for grass plots in front of their dwellings, and to other streets by making a park of proper width through the middle for the cultivation of trees and plants, and the erection of fountains. By the adoption of such a course, the streets and avenues of the city would be reduced to such width as to admit of their being thoroughly paved at a reasonable cost, and the beauty and comfort of the city immesely increased. But neither this nor any other great improvement can he expected under the present laws. They should be so modified as to require a uniform and perfect system of sewerage throughout the city, and to superintend this, and to improve and repair the streets, commissioners should be provided, one to be appointed by the Government, and one or more by the corporate authorities of the city -- the money appropriated by Congress to be expended in such proportion to the sum provided by the city as should be prescribed by law, and the obligation imposed upon the city to raise by taxation, annually, such sum as might be deemed by the commissioners necessary for the objects to be accomplished.An act of Congress to extend the charter of the Alexandria and Washington Railroad Company, and for other purposes, approved March 3, 1863, authorized the Company to erect an additional structure or passage-way along either side of the Potomac bridge for the track of their road, but so as not to hinder the general use of said bridge for ordinary travel. The surveys, estimates and plans for the construction of this bridge, together with a model of the proposed draw, were submitted to and approved by me as required by the act referred to, and the Company immediately thereafter entered upon the work. The bridge is located on a centre line 75 feet below the centre line of the old bridge, and has progressed with such remarkable rapidity as to justify the belief that it will be fully completed during the early part of the approaching session of Congress, when it is expected that the railroad travel will be diverted to it, and the old bridge restored to the use of the public, for whom it was intended.This bridge is in a dilapidated condition, and there is an urgent necessity for its immediate repair.The report of the Police Commissioners will be found to be an elaborate and interesting account of their operations during the past year, and fully attests the usefulness and importance of their organization. It, however, contains many recommendations which, if fully adopted, will impose greatly increased expenditures upon the Government. From the examination which I have been able to give to the subject, I am inclined to think an increase of the force, and of their compensation, is expedient and proper, but not to the extent indicated by the Commissioners.I have not been able to convince myself of the justice of imposing the entire support of this police system upon the Federal Government. It was shown by the census of 1860 that the District of Columbia then contained 75,000 permanent inhabitants, since which time its population has evidently been largely increased. There is no city within the United States, it is believed, in which property of all kinds yields a larger income, in proportion to its value, and no good reason exists why it should not help to defray the expense of its own protection. I am the more justified in making this suggestion by the fact that the annual tax imposed upon property in this District is much less than that imposed on the property in any of the principal cities in the United States.The suggestions of the Commissioners of the Police for the more economical and speedy punishment of crimes are just and proper, and deserve the careful consideration of Congress.A House of Correction and for the detention of juvenile offenders should be provided, and a system adopted by which vagrants and petty offenders, on conviction upon summary trial before the Police Magistrates, should receive proper punishment, by being compelled to work upon the streets, to break stone in the quarries for their improvement, or to labor in some other useful way.The want of a Penitentiary has been particularly felt in the administration of justice in this District during the past year. The whole number of convicts now under sentence from this District is 179; of this number, 143 have been convicted and sent to the Penitentiary at Albany, N.Y., since the appropriation of the Penitentiary of the United States for District of Columbia by the War Department. The average cost of transporting convicts from this District to the Penitentiary at Albany is about fifty dollars, and that of maintaining them there, one dollar and twenty-five cents per week, or sixty-five dollars per annum. It is confidently believed that, with a Penitentiary possessing the appliances necessary for the judicious application of the labor of the convicts, they could be much more economically maintained in this District, and the moral advantages secured to the community of having institutions of this character located in their midst.The Government now owns a tract of land containing 281 acres, upon which the receiving reservoir of the Washington Aqueduct is situated, which embraces suitable sites for a penitentiary and House for the detention and reform of juvenile offenders. These lands are now lying vacant. There are excellent quarries immediately contiguous thereto, from which substantial buildings could be erected. They could be located in close proximity to the canal, whence fuel could be obtained at the cheapest rates. Sewerage could be easily constructed, and all the necessary water power for propelling the requisite machinery for the successful and profitable employment of the labor of the convicts could be procured from the surplus water of the reservoir at a very small cost. I think it would be good economy to provide for the erection of penitentiary buildings upon these lands, and that it would be well for Congress at the approaching session to make the necessary provision for the commencement of the work. In a very short time many of the convicts could be provided with secure and comfortable quarters upon the premises, and employed in quarrying stone, and other labor pertaining to the construction of such works.The Act of March 3, 1863, making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the year ending June 30, 1864, and for the year ending June 30, 1863, and for other purposes, transferred from the appropriation made and placed under the control of the Secretary of the Treasury by the Act of June 23, 1860, for the detection and arrest of counterfeiters of the coin of the United States, the sum of $1,184, or so much thereof as might be necessary to enable the Secretary of the Interior \"to pay detective police employed by a former head of the department, for expenses incurred and services rendered in the Cities of Washington and Philadelphia, in the detection and arrest of counterfeiters of United States coin.\" Having examined all the claims presented, and found them to have been liquidated and paid as per agreement made with the claimants prior to the rendition of the service, I recommend the passage of a law to repeal the provision alluded to in the Act of March 3, 1863, and to restore the amount thereby transferred to the control of the Secretary of the Treasury for the purposes originally designed.While the African Slave-trade is known to be carried on still from some foreign ports to a lamentable extent, it is gratifying to be able to state that so successful have been the efforts of this Government to prevent citizens of the United States from engaging in it, that not a single vessel is known or believed to have been fitted out in our own waters for that purpose during the past year, and the wholesome examples which have resulted from the energy and vigilance which have been and are still being displayed by the officers immediately charged with the enforcement of the laws on this subject, together with the growing sense of justice among our people toward the African race, will, it is hoped, effectually deter persons from any future participation in so unrighteous a traffic.The officers appointed pursuant to the requirements of the treaty of April, 1862, with Great Britain, have repaired to their several stations, and the mixed Courts of Justice, to reside at the City of New-York, Sierra Leone, and the Cape of Good Hope, have been duly organized and established.The accounts of the American Colonization Society, for the support of recaptured Africans in Liberia, have not yet been finally settled, owing to the imperfect manner in which they have been kept by the Resident Agent of the United States in that Republic, and the Liberian authorities after the transfer of the recaptives to them. The information and facts required to be regularly reported, not having been recorded and preserved by them, it is feared they cannot now be obtained with the accuracy of detail contemplated by the strict terms of the contracts, and hence it is respectfully recommended that the department be authorized by law to adjust and settle the accounts on equitable principles.No further appropriation is asked for this object, the unexpended balances of former appropriations being sufficient to meet all the legal demands that can possibly be made during the present and the next ensuing fiscal year. The reenactment of the joint resolution of the 3d of March last, \"respecting the compensation of Judges, and so forth, under the treaty with Great Britain, and other persons employed in the suppression of the slave-trade,\" will be necessary, however, to authorize the use of those funds for the service of the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1865.I am unable to report any greater disposition, generally, among the colored persons, for whose colonization provision was made by certain recent acts of Congress, to emigrate, than had been exhibited at the time of your last annual message. Since that time, however, about 450 have been deported to the Ile a Vache, adjacent and belonging to the Republic of Hayti. The condition of this colony has been variously represented, and an agent has been deputed by the Government to visit the island and report the real situation of affairs, and the future prospects of the emigrants there. They were emigrated under a contract entered into for that purpose, with persons who were represented as possessing every qualification and fitness for insuring the success of the experiment; but nothing has yet been paid them under it, nor will there be until the report of the agent shall have been received and found to justify it.Independent of the seeming unwillingness of this class of persons to leave the United States, the experience the country has derived since the passage of the acts of Congress on the subject of colonization, and the action of the Government toward them in adopting the able-bodied men into its armies, render it a question of great importance whether the effort to colonize them beyond the limits of the United States should be continued, unless the way should be opened for the establishment of a friendly colony in some one of the Central American States, at a favorable commercial point, for traversing that country by a new route to the Pacific.Although much prejudice had been manifested throughout most of the Free States in regard to the introduction of colored persons therein, there is a place where many of them can now be advantageously employed at remunerative prices, and where the objection to color does not exist. I refer to the line of the Pacific Railroad. Upon this work there are already about 300 free colored laborers, out of 1,500 employed, and I am assured they perform their duty faithfully and well. This department has been repeatedly urged to use its influence to cause as many colored laborers as can be procured to be employed on this work, and it is worthy of consideration, therefore, whether the money appropriated to remove those who are now a charge upon the Government to foreign countries will not be more judiciously employed in transporting them to those fields of labor within the dominions of the United States where they are wanted and where they will be welcomed. In this way the expense to which the Government is now subjected will be greatly diminished, and we shall have the satisfaction of placing these people in a position of usefulness, security and peace, where they will be instrumental in the construction of a work in which the nation has, of all others, save the putting down of this rebellion, the greatest interest.The need at the seat of government of a Bureau of National Statistics has long been felt, and often been called to, and engaged the attention of Congress, but so far without any practical results. The facts and information which a properly organized bureau of this character would collect and exhibit are often indispensable, as well to the enlightened legislator as to the several Departments of the Government, and the people at large. It is confidently believed that it would contribute immensely to the advancement of the commercial, agricultural, financial, scientific, manufacturing and other interests of our people, and, by the dissemination of correct information as to our national wealth, interests and resources, lead to a more just appreciation of the value to all of the American Unions and contribute, in no small degree, to the more universal establishment and maintenance of friendly relations between ourselves and the other civilized nations of the earth.Such a bureau could be established now with but little outlay, and if made to include the duty of enumerating the population of the United States, for which purpose a bureau is now required to be temporarily organized every ten years, at considerable expense and labor, would effect a positive saving to the Treasury, while the work would be better performed, as the officer would then be permanent, and the experience gained in the operations of one decade not wholly lost before the next was entered upon as is now the case. Most enlightened nations have perceived the necessity and utility of organized effort for the attainment of accurate statistical knowledge, and to profit by their experience is the dictate of wisdom. Deeply impressed with the importance of the subject, I venture to refer to it again, and to invoke for it the favorable consideration of Congress.On the 3d of March, 1863, a joint resolution was enacted authorizing and directing the Secretary of the Interior, and all other custodians thereof, to cause equal distribution to be forthwith made among the members of the two Houses of the then expiring Congress, of all books and documents which had been printed or purchased at the cost of the Government, and not actually belonging to any public library, or the library kept for use in any department of the Government, excepting, however, all such books and documents as were embraced in any existing order for the distribution thereof among the members of either House of Congress. I found, on examination, that the number of volumes of the documents referred to, their incompleteness as sets or works, and the uncertainty as to their value, aggregately or separately, were such as to render it wholly impracticable to carry the provisions of the joint resolution into effect, and the subject is therefore respectfully submitted for the further consideration and action of Congress.For years past the department has had to encounter difficulties in providing suitable accommodations for the United States Courts in the City of New-York. Congress alone can apply the, remedy, and it should not be longer deferred. For many years apartments in the City Hall were used for this purpose, but the necessities of the City, demanded them, and they had to be given up. Since then the department has been obliged to rent other buildings annually, or for a short term of years, and to alter and fit them up at considerable expense. The premises now used were leased by the department in the year 1858, for the sum of $16,000 per annum. A large sum has been expended for alterations, occasional repairs, and furniture, amounting in six years, including rent, to upward of $125,000. The present lease of the property will expire on the 1st of May next. The owner of it has died since the original lease was made, and the executors, though still willing to dispose of it at the price then fixed -- $215,000 -- are averse to extending the lease, so that the department will soon have to procure other temporary accommodations for the Courts sitting in New-York City, unless Congress shall provide the means to secure permanent ones.The Government has purchased or erected buildings at Philadelphia, Boston, and a number of less important cities, for the joint use of the Federal Courts and other public purposes, and commenced the erection of one also at Baltimore. The propriety of extending this prudent policy to the City of New-York seems too manifest to require argument. Economy alone demands it.The department is not prepared to say that the purchase of the building now used, for the sum asked, would be the most advantages arrangement that could be made; but it would, in the end, be the saving of considerable expense to the Treasury. I therefore earnestly recommend that the department be empowered by Congress to provide suitable and permanent accommodations for the United States Courts at New-York, and that an adequate appropriation be made for that purpose.chartered by the act of Congress entitled \"An act to aid in the construction of a Railroad and Telegraph Line from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the Government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes,\" approved July 1, 1862, has been organized by the election of Directors and other officers, and the subscription of the requisite amount of stock. The character and pecuniary ability of the stockholders afford the most ample guarantee that this great work will be prosecuted to a successful issue. The work upon the branch lately located by you has already been commenced with a determination to press it to a rapid completion, despite the inclemency of the season and other obstacles.The southern branch of the road, having its eastern terminus at the mouth of the Kansas River, and now known as that of the \"Pacific Railway Company, eastern division,\" is being constructed with unparalleled energy. Since the 1st of September last, about forty miles of this branch have been graded, the ties made ready, the iron and rolling stock purchased and delivered upon the ground or now in transitu. We have assurances, on which a well-founded belief may be based, that early next month it will be completed, and during next Summer extended to Fort Riley, a distance of 130 miles.The principal obstacle to the rapid progress of the work is the scarcity of labor, which may be overcome by the employment of the freedmen, as before indicated in this report.The California branch of the Pacific Railroad is being constructed with all practicable dispatch, and there is every reason to believe that the work will not be permitted to languish, but that, at an earlier day than could have been reasonably anticipated, the entire line will be completed.The extent and unsurpassed richness of the gold fields recently discovered in Arizona, together with our previous knowledge of the vast mineral wealth of New-Mexico, is well calculated to impress all who reflect upon the subject with the necessity of a branch road from the Union Pacific to Santa Fe, and such other points in the Territory of New-Mexico as maybe necessary to the development of the mineral wealth and trade of that country; and although Congress may be unwilling to lend pecuniary aid or credit to such an enterprise, it is believed that a liberal grant of land, both arable and mineral, of comparatively little present value to the Government to the companies now organized, or to one to be chartered by the Territorial Legislature of New-Mexico, will insure its speedy construction. There are vast fields of iron ore, and coal suitable for its manufacture, convenient to the line of the proposed branch road, and, though the enterprise may appear stupendous, the income to be derived from it would doubtless soon afford ample compensation to those who might accomplish it.I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant, J.P.

It were impossible to give an accurate estimate. I will, however, endeavor to lay before my readers such as commonly come under the notice of an Aurist daily.

DlSEASES OF THE BRAIN.In a treatise on the Ear it would be misplaced to describe the malformation or deficiences in the development of the brain which must produce dysecoea, combined with a partial or complete loss of the other functions of sense sometimes reaches the tympanitum, an abscess having burst through the membrane, leaving an aperture through which the origin of the fungus can be traced, and which seriously affect the Larynx, and which affects the quality of human voice. The articulate character of sounds is for mankind one of the most Important arrangements which exist in the universe; for it is by this sounds become the interpreters of thoughts, will and feeling, the means by which a person can convey his wants, his necessities, his instructions, his promises, and his kind feelings to others; by which one roan can regulate the actions and influence the convictions and judgments of another. It is in virtue of the possibility of shaping air into words that the imperceptible vibrations which a man produces in the atmosphere, become some of his most important actions, the foundation of the highest moral and social relations, and the condition and instrument of all the advancement and improvement of which he is susceptible. \"This wonderful speech,\" says a medical writer in his essay, \"the grand prerogative of mankind, could not have been invented without an Ear of the utmost delicacy of construction to catch the infinite variety of sounds, and a Sensorium to perceive and reflect upon the impressions communicated to this organ. It is therefore all gratifying to trace the correspondence of development in the organs of Speech and of Hearing to their perfect condition in man, and, whilst admiring, to adore the infinite wisdom of the Divine Designer.The manner in which Dumbness results from Deafness is very intelligible. We know that the child learns to speak by reproducing the sounds which he hears daily; the intelligence, also, is favorably disposed to this process in the early stages of life. If, then, the Ear does not seize the sounds of the speaker, the mouth cannot reproduce them. This fact affords the simple and obvious reason why Dumbness necessarily follows Deafness. If at a more advanced age we happen to restore, by any means, the faculty of hearing entirely, or in part, the intelligence is no longer so favorably disposed to the repetition of speech, thus rendering it so difficult to educate the dumb even after their hearing faculty is restored or improved. It is gratifying to the surgeon that all cases are improvable by the new mode of treatment, and very frequently curable. In the present state of knowledge, it is to a distressing degree unavailable, vet the daily advance of science justifies the hope that more may be achieved also for suffering humanity. I have invented Instruments in which I place the firmest reliance, and to which habit has accustomed me, and I fearlessly assert that they will be fouud by any one who is anxious to acquire excellence in this specialty, the best that have been invented, into a description of which I cannot here enter, because they are not to be thoroughly understood without some examples of them, and diagrams exhibiting the precise manner in which they act. At the same lime, I am most willing to do justice to others, who have, with great assiduity and labor, brought to perfection many manipulatory powers, in which they have, with justice, confidence.The treatment of deafness, above all the maladies to which the organs of the human frame are liable, must depend upon the general skill and well-founded experience of the practitioner. As we have before observed, the Eye and Tact are absolutely requisite to decide upon what class of remedies he is to depend, as the variation in the extent of deafness is almost indefinite. From the slightest possible, hardly perceptible deficiency in function, to its complete loss, in which a cannon shot excites no effect, there are cases in which the extent of deafness and disorganization of structure are very great. The membranes, and even the ossicles of the tympanum, may be lost by disease, and yet the sense of hearing may only be slightly impaired, so as not to be recognizable by ordinary observers. On the other hand, a collection of mucous in the TYMPANUM, the organ being otherwise quite healthy, will produce deafness so complete as to occasion dumbness. These facts, in many cases, may be accounted for by the circumstances of the various undulations being transmitted directly across the diseased tympanum to the membranes of the fenestra ovalis. There is such a great resemblance in the diseases of the Eye and Ear, though apparently so very different from each other, that they coincide in many respects both in their structure and in their diseases.(To be Continued.)"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/21/archives/surgical-and-practical-observations-on-the-diseases-of-the-ear-with.html", "headline": "SURGICAL AND PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS; ON THE DISEASES OF THE EAR, WITH THE NEW MODE OF TREATING DEAFNESS TO WHICH IS ADDED AN APPENDIX, Containing a Treatise on Catarrh and the New System of Treating it.BY J.E.

Young people seldom discover that they hear imperfectly until about the age of puberty, or when they begin to use the organ of hearing in earnest. Many persons reach the age of thirty or forty years before they have any notion that they are deaf. They may have suspected that they did not hear across the street, or the minister, or at the theatre, quite so plainly as other people, and they are surprised to find that their neighbors hear every word and they do not. Then they become conscious that they do not hear as well as everybody: but they had no idea that they were the subjects of any defect in their hearing, or that their hearing could be improved.Although deafness is, in general, gradual in its progress, manifesting itself about the period of puberty, and increasing from that period up to twenty or twenty-five years of age, yet instances occasionally occur of the impediment in hearing existing in children, or of the sudden loss of the hearing of a grown-up person who had previously heard distinctly at an ordinary distance. When children, about the period of being sent to school, are supposed not to catch sounds quite as quickly as they should, we should then make a careful examination of the organ, so as to find the cause why the sound, in conveying information to the Senso[???]ium, is impeded. It is a vulgar error that an imperfect hearing is, by age, rendered better calculated to hear at a distance than it was in youth. This opinion appears to have been built on the following false analogy -- viz.: that those who possess an ordinarily good hearing became, from some of those changes in the structure of the organ of hearing which we have before pointed out, more acute as they approached old age, which is a well-established fact. But this change is a sure indication of the total loss of hearing, as the meatus auditorius is then so delicate that it receives the sound quickly, with a vibration concentrated by the auricle, which conveys the sound to the Membrana Tympani. There are facts enough to prove that if we even do possess the power of removing the disease, so that the hearing faculty may resume its normal functions, yet the reproduction of the parts by nature already destroyed by the disease is, in mature years, uncertain and slow, as the reparative power is greater, most particularly in the organ of which I am treating, in the young than in those individuals of more advanced years. Even when we compare patients that have all attained their highest development and growth, this seems to be natural. We know it from general observations of the results of injuries from such diseases of the Ear in persons of different ages; numerous as the exceptions may be, as a general rule it appears true.All these facts agree well with the belief that the formative power is gradually diminished in the acts of organizing matter for the maintenance of the function of perfect hearing, and the difference between the completeness of reproduction of injured parts in children and that in adults appears so much greater than the difference in adults of different ages, that it is probable the formative power is more diminished by growth than it is by the mere maintenance. To reproduce an injured part requires perfection of formative power. The best example we can give to illustrate that early attention to the slightest impediment in hearing should not be neglected or deferred, is the following, from a lecture delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, by Prof. JAMES PAGET. He says: \"That he removed an arterial erectile tumor from the External Ear, which occupied the adjacent subcutaneous tissues and part of the scalp. The back of the Auricle, and nearly the whole extent, was puffed by a superficial swelling.\" It is manifest, according to this eminent anatomist's own illustration, that it could have been easily removed if it had been treated and removed in an earlier stage, for he further states that -- \"This disease had been noticed like a very small pimple, when the patient was young. It had, from that time, regularly increased. The tumor was gorged with blood, consisting of small vessels collected in a soft, spongy mass. This was especially observed in the auricular artery.\" Another similar case the same learned professor speaks of as being recorded by Mr. COOTE, being also a large tumor of the Ear. We may trace half of the deaf in this country to the want of being checked by early attention, when a little care will do it. Indeed, after looking into a vast number of volumes from the pens of the experienced and skillful medical writers, my opinion is confirmed, that if attention were paid in infancy to the slightest defect in hearing, we should have none of those obstinate or incurable cases which sometimes baffle the most skillful Aurist. I have no hesitation in stating that it is our bounden duty to instill into the minds of those who wish to enjoy the happy privilege of hearing, that it is absolutely necessary for deaf persons never to suffer themselves to be scared away from social intercourse because they cannot participate in conversation with that facility which their more fortunate brethren enjoy.The matchless forms of sculptured beauty which the destroying hand of time has left us in the works of the mighty masters of the classic time, exhibit to us the finest specimens of the Ear. We are immediately struck with the delicacy with which the exterior Ear is organized, both for the conveyance of sound to the brain, and its protection from escape, as well as an exquisite addition to the face, which would otherwise appear long and monotonous. Its shell-like, undulating form, seems to have been the result of the examination of the most perfect human models; but we must not forget, altogether, the HAND which made the small organ upon whose perfect organization, depends much of the happiness of man: and were a mechanic found who could imitate this most wonderful little organ, he would be a subject of much surprise and admiration, and he would be rewarded for his skill and ingenuity. We are loud in our expressions of admiration of the wondrous melodies of the accomplished cantatrice. We quit the opera-house with a feeling of joy, and the song we liked most still seems to ring in our Ears; but we forget the marvelous construction of the little fabric which conveys to us the extraordinary performances. If we derive so much happiness and pleasure from the perfection of this little organ, how much misery do we find when we are unfortunate enough to be deprived of its pleasing and useful functions? We, therefore, while it is in our reach, ought to endeavor to take every precaution for its preservation and protection.To give the causes of the disease which I have enumerated, there are many minutiae upon which there is little occasion to dwell. If I may become the means only of arresting the attention to proper precautions, thereby avoiding many of those life-long sufferings to which the deaf are subject, I would consider the time I have employed in compiling these sheets not thrown away, nor regret that I have ventured to become an author.Itard says \"that the shape of the Auricle is well adapted to receive and concentrate sounds, and direct them to the meatus.\" It is supposed that, from this circumstance, the tyrant Dionysius, of Syracuse, had constructed a subterraneous cavern in a rock, in the form of the Human Ear, which measured eighty feet in height and two hundred and fifty-feet in length. The sounds of this cave were necessarily directed to a common tympanum, communicating with an adjoining room, where Dionysius spent the greater part of his time to listen to whatever was said by those whom his suspicions and cruelty had confined in the apartments above.(To be Continued.)"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/14/archives/surgical-and-practical-observations-on-the-diseases-of-the-ear-with.html", "headline": "SURGICAL AND PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE DISEASES OF THE EAR, WITH THE NEW MODE OF TREATING DEAFNESS.

VON EISENBERG. M.D. of No. 816 Broadway.The absurd belief that every deaf person can be cured by one treatment has, in many instances, led to the great disappointment of the sufferer. As I have already had occasion to remark, every one who cannot hear is deaf; but every deafness arises from a different disease, and, consequently, requires a different treatment. There is no surgeon who has devoted his attention to aural surgery, who has not seen the numerous and different forms of disease in varieties which all and each of them cause the loss of Hearing. I wish that some of the distinguished members of our profession could have induced the educated practitioner to investigate those numerous diseases which are obnoxious to the faculty of Hearing. And, until the morbid affections of the ear be treated according to the general principles of pathology, and all diseases separately enumerated, with their seats, and more especially until the study of those affections be regarded as constituting an essential and necessary part of medical education, it will be in vain to hope for an improvement in the limited knowledge of this interesting class of disease, which is at present possessed, most particularly when we find the importance of Hearing most remarkably augmented from its intimate connection with speech.It is not essential for me to detail all the numerous diseases of the ear, and which cause Deafness; but there are certain diseases which, by their enumeration, will throw considerable light upon many points buried in darkness, and it will materially assist in the restoration of Hearing. As they have been scarcely reverted to by any of those who have had the best opportunity of witnessing them, much surprise would be excited were they to be arranged and classified: it might be clearly shown that the most alarming cases of Deafness could be easily arrested in infancy. I should have been glad if some surgeon had prepared my way by showing how regularly spring up, one after the other, a fearful train of symptoms, when a disease connected with the organ of Hearing, apparently of little consequence, excites the sensibility of its nerves and the irritability of the entire organ in a great degree. Life cannot sustain an injury to the system without a struggle, which gives rise to phenomena that require deeper investigation than has been hitherto bestowed upon them, even by those who most have thought. The following is an array of diseases, each of which will signally interfere with the power of Hearing; the diagnosis, therefore, is not very difficult where the disease is fully established:1. INSPISSATION OF WAX IN THE MEATUS; the exact analogue of that secretion not being else where met with.2. Local PREDISPOSITION OF THE ORGAN AFFECTED by the general constitution of the individual.3.

POLYPINS.-- To describe, which would be out of the question, as their numerous and various forms differ so much from the other diseases of the Ear in its texture. More organized matter enters into their composition, as is evinced by the facility with which bleeding is produced by the slightes[???] touch with an instrument. They burrow more completely under the surface, and are held on by a species of peduncle, sometimes of great broadness, at other times assuming a very slight and pendulous form. They do occasionally occur in the meatus, and are generally the result of inflammation of its dermoids layer -- as it is attached to its surface. They generally spring from the outer or inner surface of the Membrane Tympam. I think myself that they are, in some measure, connected with the constitution: and though they wear the form of a local disorder, yet are they more or less influenced by some state of health which is not fully understood. Various, however, have been the attempts to ascertain from what portion of the dermoid coverings they spring as they more generally make their appearance on the MUCOUS MEMBRANE things, are never on the exposed epidermis. The contradictory opinions only serve to show how unequal is the best judgment of a single individual upon some of apparently the most [???] of the works of nature. Nor have some theorists been wanting in what has been cased extravagance, who have assigned to globules of Mercury taken by the parents the \"sons of [???] malorum.\" They are pustules containing an infinitesimal portion of some other of the mineral or organic bodies which have not found their [???]ue action in Nature's laboratory, the stomach, and are, therefore, to be elsewhere expelled by the \"[???] medi[???]atris natur[???]\".The humoral pathologists have been more than usually eloquent upon this subject, and have talked of the expulsion of gross mo[???]fic matter unfortunately stopped in its career, and determined to the surface of the mucous membrane. As it is my lot, \"tantis comp[???]nerelites,\" I will endeavor to discuss this matter which is so immediately destructive to the sense of Hearing, by a description of the causes of the above disease, which I am about to give, and afterwards by a description of my own mode of treatment. A popular writer on the Ear says: \"POLYPUS FUNGUS, or VEGETATION of the Auditory Canal, is an exceedingly common occurrence.\" These terms are applied very frequently in a synonymous sense, but probably it would further pathological distinctions, if they were better defined. The term POLYPUS (though its etymology means many-footed,) is ordinarily applied to a growth from a particular spot of a mucous membrane, the rest of the membrane being healthy, or, at all events, not implicated in that growth. This morbid production has usually one pedicle, but there may be several such attachments. Its vascularity varies. Occasionally a small artery runs down the centre, while in other cases the whole POLYPUS resembles a congress of bloody vessels. FUNGUS is usually intended to imply a diseased growth arising from a membrane more extensively disorganized, and frequently proceed from an [???]cer or a sinus. It consists of a mass of exuberant granulations, always soft and vascular: but as there is usually a want of power in the circulation, the color is generally of a palish red hue. The FUNGUS, unlike the POLYPUS, is not uniform in its shape, but irregular, both as regards its extent of attachment to the diseased membrane, and as respects the division of its loose extremity into lobules. There is always a discharge of matter, either mucous or purulent, or muco-purufe[???] The term VEGETATION is more frequently applied to numerous little diseased growths from a more or less extensive surface of a mucous membrane. They are sometimes soft and fungoid, with narrow attachments: at other times firm and conical. The degree of vascularity varies, and the vessels always secrete a fluid, though not so copiously as in the FUNGUS. Such are the different appearances these growths assume in the external Ear, in particular. The anatomist, once the great leader of the schools of Surgery, Albinus, has characterized the Organ of Hearing as an \"essential endowment,\" It is, therefore, essentially necessary to watch the beginning of every little impediment in the Organ of Hearing: then we will not only be able to preserve tins precious gift, but we should carefully learn the end and aims of our great Artificer; because, from these beginnings we ascertain what is best to he done for the proper health and due preservation of each part of the human structure. Thus we should be enabled not only to counteract any deviations from our normal state, but to have it in our power to render our original gifts more available; and hence, by early education and watchfulness we shall be enabled to turn them to greater account, not only for our own benefit but for that of society at large."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/08/archives/surgical-and-practical-observations-on-the-diseases-of-the-ear-with.html", "headline": "Surgical and Practical Observations on the Diseases of the Ear,; WITH THE NEW MODE OF TREATING DEAFNESS.

It is like every other species of knowledge: it is to be gained by diligence and practice. It requires, however, a considerable length of time before a student, however assiduous he may be, is fitted for all the anomalies which present themselves, and which has demanded, on my part, considerable labor, observation and anxiety. No one, however fortunate he may have been in acquiring the confidence of the public, can altogether divest himself of anxious fears when about to commence an operation for the restoration of hearing, on which the welfare of a fellow-being is dependent, and I can conscientiously assert that I have at all times exerted myself to the best of my ability to give immediate benefit. I have always maintained self-possession and calmness during the whole operation, whatever might present itself of unexpected difficulty; and I have been happy enough to have escaped those dangers into which others have fallen. My own system of treatment, which I would recommend hereafter to others, is best calculated to insure success, as well as the prevention of a recurrence or relapse, which may again prove a source of suffering to the unfortunate patient.Watching the progress of the efforts made by nature for the reproduction of parts that have teen destroyed, is always one of the most interesting occupations of the physiologist, who often enjoys opportunities of studying a most important leaf of the Book of Nature.However skillful the Aurist may be, no task can be more difficult than the description of an operation, or the precise laws to be attended to when it becomes necessary to have recourse to the Ear Fumigator. It is only practical expedience, and it is only the well accustomed eye that knows the precise moment at which such interference is necessary as may lead to the ultimate well-doing of the patient.A vast number of cases must found the groundwork on which both theory and practice must rest. In vain will the most accurate language convey the ideas of the observant man, if beside that, there is not the tact and judgment which are only to be acquired by having the attention constantly fixed on a subject, and the readiness which can only be attendant upon habit.The eye and tact are absolutely requisite to decide on what class of remedies we should depend. The remedies which in one instance are highly beneficial, may be detrimental in another; and it is only from the actual ocular inspection of the state of the organ and a proper diagnosis that we can give directions as to the course to be pursued. All deaf persons cannot hear, but all deaf persons do not suffer from the same disease. It is one of those instances which the opposers of [???]osological systems have so often brought forward. You call certain symptoms by a certain name, and you then have recourse to a certain class of remedies, which have been found efficacious in that disease, forgetting that in each individual instance there are symptoms peculiar to it. You may call a certain number of symptoms olilis or otalgia; you may then immediately prescribe antichlogistic treatments; but the wise practitioner knows that bleeding is not good in every stage of olilis, as the meatus may be also unduly influenced, and that there are certain circumstances under which it is not advantageously exercised; and he will know that the treatment must be conducted upon general principles.When the inflammation is peculiar, the object of the surgeon is to lessen its severity during the necessary progress, so as to diminish the probability of the affection extending to the meatus, as every experienced surgeon knows that by the term olitis, is meant the general disease of the whole organ, acute and chronic. Inflammation may either be external or internal: the former including the affection of the Auricle and meatus Auditorius: the latter, that of the tympanum and labyrinth. Nilra muriat and the Acetus injections all are capable of affording relief. The most judicious plan is to be guided by symptoms, to do nothing that can keep up irritation, and to soothe and palliate rather than attempt to drive away by active means a malady which may, by injudicious treatment, become a source of much pain and lasting deafness. I most earnestly recommend that leeches should not be employed: the quantity drawn by them is never sufficient to do any good, and much time is lost which might be advantageously employed by other means. This plan, which is followed upon every occasion where inflammation occurs often, is attended with mischievous effects, and leaves behind a degree of debility sometimes difficult to be overcome. How often have I known a deaf person, who has first been tormented with leeches, and then with cupping and blistering, and then with caustic, who would have been quickly restored to his hearing by simpler means, and would have avoided a long confinement. The noise and buzzing in the ear supervenes in acute pain and sometimes swelling to a fearful extent of the EXTERNAL EAR.In thus giving my humble advice for the prevention of mischief, it must be remembered that the active and the inactive are to be considered, and that I am laying down general rules for the guidance of all; but there are many circumstances which would naturally modify my treatment. I would have every one careful, whilst he is studying the precepts best adapted for his own case, to remember that there may be too much attention as well as too little. The equilibrium of health is to be maintained by a knowledge of what is to be done, and by judiciously carrying into practice those rules which carry with them the semblance of truth. It is impossible to lay down one unchangeable rule. As all men are not equally adapted to the bed of Procrustes, so neither are one set of regulations to be followed by all. Each person is marked with peculiarities; and as no two faces are precisely similar, so are there no parts of the body in two individuals bearing precisely the same stamp, or obedient to the same influences; but there are general and defined laws which regulate all things, and enable us to arrive at conclusions which embrace the larger portions of that which has been created.In a former chapter, I remarked of all works on Diseases of the Ear (as there are few works on the subject of any consideration.) I have not found one wherein reference to the mucous membrane -- the inner skin, as it were, of the internal cavities of the body -- has been made. To the attentive observer of health and disease, the mucous membranes must always rank amongst the most interesting and most important of the tissues of the human frame. There is such a sympathy existing between the organs which excrete the fluid and the skin, that we are not at a loss to account for diseases springing up in the one tissue where the other has had its usual condition altered, or where some of these changes, which modern chemistry has so clearly shown, have occurred. We find that there are three tissues to which the name of dermoid coverings is given, each performing certain functions necessary to the healthy condition of the body, and each liable to certain deviations from the normal state, which are productive of pain and disorder.The first of these tissues is a membrane, varying in its degrees of thickness; distributed over the surface of the human body to which the name of epidermis is given: the second is a congeries of vessels from which is constantly issuing a secretion which lubricates the under-surface of the epidermis. To this tissue, from its resemblance to a collection of net-work, and from the exudation which is always pouring forth from it, the term rete mucosum has been applied. This tissue extends over the whole surface of the body, as far as the mouth, where it commences. The great mucous membrane, which ramifies throughout the inner organs, commences at the mouth, at the junction of the rete mucosum with the transparent tissue of the lips, and extends inwardly through the mouth. It is the groundwork through which the vital functions of secretion, exaction and absorption are effected. The perfection of sight and hearing are mainly dependent on it. One of the learned physicians of the day says that it is impossible to imagine how the facility of speech depends on it. It enters into all the mucous and saliva glands, giving off delicate prolongations for the lining of the nasal cavities, the cells and sinews in the upper jaw, and the bones of the cranium and fare which are obedient to the sense of Hearing, and extends to the mucous lining of the Eustachian tubes. In fact, it covers the whole surface and cells behind the organ of Hearing, and downward to the throat -- extending, or spreading, all over the inner portion of the body. Beneath the rete mucosum is that covering which forms its exquisite sensibility, and, from its being apparently the natural seat of sensation, has been called the cutis rera, or true skin. Its upper surface receives from the rete mucosum a portion of its secretion. Each of these tissues appears to have been considered absolutely necessary for the welfare of the human being: they protect him from agency of the external causes which would be pernicious to him, whilst at the same time they enable him to enjoy all those gratifications which arise from the sense of touch so generally diffused over the whole external system. The epidermis, a thick layer in most parts of the body, prevents the imbibition into the system of any deleterious matter, and its absence from accident is productive of the greatest mischief. Its abrasion has been known to be the source of danger and of death. The poison of the mad dog is drank in as soon as it penetrates; prussic acid kills when applied to the skin when abraded. The celebrated SCHARINGER, of Vienna, having rubbed upon his arm a small quantity of prussic acid highly concentrated, included a small spot where the epidermis was wanting, and instantaneous death followed. A minister in France, under the care of MAJENDIE, was poisoned in a moment by the application of the smallest appreciable quantity of strychnine to a part of the skin which had been denuded of its epidermis. This tissue resists in a singular manner the ordinary decay to which the human body is subject. It is not unusual, on the discovery of a corpse which has been for years beneath the surface of the earth, to find that the epidermis has remained almost uninjured, and the external appearance of the frame has led to the belief that the usual process to which nature has recourse for the removal of dead animal matter, has not occurred; but, upon closer examination, it has been seen that the epidermis alone presents this appearance.In coffins, large masses are found when the rest of the body has decayed away. Sometimes the whole of the portion covering the ear is seen apparently in its normal state. The formation of this tissue is not thoroughly understood, but the general impression is that it rises out of the secretion of the subjacent mucous tissue. Its structure has been closely examined, MALPRIGHI, GREW and LEWENBKCK have been the authorities upon which most anatomists have rested; but upon some of the most important facts there are discrepancies of opinion into which it is unnecessary for me to enter, but which prove how difficult it is, upon a subject apparently easily investigated, and which is interesting to all, to arrive at conclusions satisfactory to us. We are, however, certain that this tissue is formed of numerous lamina, or scales, which overlap each other, much as do the tiles that protect the upper part of a house. It has even been asserted that the ingenuity with which we roof in the coverings of our domiciles to prevent the action of rain and of external mischief, is apparently the most insignificant imitation of the structure which protects man's person from the agency of similar inconveniences. The microscope exhibits the epidermis to be much of the same character as the scales which protect fish, and the magnifying power of the hydro-oxygen microscope has unfolded some very curious circumstances, which connect themselves with points of importance relating to this external covering. If lost, it is speedily restored; a scale of thickness is rapidly formed; but its absence, as I have had occasion to mention, may become a source of serious mischief when raised from the subjacent tissue, as is done by vesication. We find it transparent, composed of vascular fibre, and in most instances abounding with, lines. Whether actual foramina exist, through which the sensible and insensible perspiration pass, has been the subject of some doubt. It has been asserted that it is transmitted under the scales, which are of exceeding minuteness. Immediately under this scurf skin, or epidermis, is a tissue to which the term rete mucosum has been generally applied. It appears to be the termination of innumerable capillary vessels, which secrete a mucous of singular character. This is the seat of the pigment which gives the color to the varieties of the human race. To this the European owes his redness, the Chinese his tawny hue, and the Negro his blackness. A portion of mucous lubricates the upper surfare of the cutis vera, and another the inferior surface of the epidermis. It is, generally speaking, of nearly the same thickness as the epidermis, but varies in different parts of the ear. Under this layer lies the cutis vera, or true skin; it has been considered as a tissue formed of the immediate termination of the nerves and vessels which ramify over its surface. It is the source of sensibility and the seat of touch, and by it sensation is conveyed through the ear to the brain and medullary masses. It appears, too, to be endowed with the power of imbibition, for any substance may have its peculiar properties conveyed with extraordinary rapidity to the brain, the ear, the lungs, the heart, or the secretions of the body. Hence it is that substances rubbed on the skin transmit their power to the stomach; for on the removal of the epidermis and the application of medicinal substances to the subcutaneous tissue we can produce sleep, act upon the bowels, cause vomiting, or give tone and strength to the general system.It may appear to some that the points here treated do not deserve the attention I have bestowed upon them, but it must be remembered that it is absolutely necessary to describe their important relations with a view to the benefit derivable from a treatment which embraces all the vital functions, and none can afford to be put out of consideration even in the management of a strictly local disease, An English writer of great eloquence makes a 1st remark that even in the writings of ITARD and KRAMER, the best writers on the subject, not a page is devoted to the intimate connection existing between the stomach and the ear. It is my firm opinion that deaf persons themselves know well the sympathy existing between the stomach and the auditory organ. I have myself elicited from patients, more particularly those who confound it with nervous deafness, that they felt relieved from the buzzing noises and they thought they heard better when the stomach and the allied viscera, the liver, etc, became deranged. It may appear strange, nevertheless it is truth, that nervous deafness generally is no more than the deleterious influence on the auditory nerves of dyspeptic constitutions.When we reflect how much the well-being of individuals depends upon domestic comforts and the attention to minute points which escape the notice of superficial observers. I feel persuaded that I shall not be supposed to have treated the subject with a greater degree of anxiety than is necessary. Aurists have had their attention so much directed to the ear alone as to have entirely disregarded the most important object -- namely, the relation that it bears to the whole system. My experience justifies fully my attempt to impress upon the minds of those laboring under deafness, whose procrastination in applying for medical relief proves a fatal error, the absolute necessity of attention to their ailments. Studying as I have done under the first authorities, I have had my theories corrected and my opinions confirmed by practice.It is astonishing what a multitude of deaf attribute to the stomach the cause of their aural disease; and there is no doubt that it is the track of the mucus membrane lining which is the exciting seat of the disease. The internal cavities of the ear scarcely come within scope of the vision, and few or none can form a correct judgment themselves of what may be taking place hourly in this much exposed and excessively delicate organ. They are satisfied if they do not feel pain or inconvenience, and flatter themselves that, as things have always gone well, they will do no always; but there are a variety of changes eternally taking place in man's person of which he is the last to be cognizant. He know not that he is growing older; that the system of to-day is somewhat different from that of yesterday, and that it is necessary to be on his guard for tomorrow.I am recommending prevention -- I am not now speaking or cure; but this, I must say, one half of the maladies which it has been my lot to have witnessed might hive been prevented had ordinary care been taken. If alterations occur in the various stages of life -- in features, in the strength of the muscular system, in the vigor of the senses -- is it not likely that the same change takes place in ail the finer nerves of such a delicate organ as the ear? And that singular variations occur in it, the slightest observation certainly proves. In reply to the question -- \"In what cases do you recommend constitutional treatment, and in what does such constitutional treatment exist?\ufffd a practical writer says: \"When there is a strawberry-looking tongue, a relaxed urula. enlarged tonsils. enlargement of the neck, thickening of the lining membrane of the Eustachian tunes, an irritable state of the lining membrane of the nostrils, a strumous habit -- and, also, when there is an irritable state of the mucous membranes - I should expect that constitutional treatment would benefit my patient and assist the mechanical process which I might consider right to use; and my constitutional treatment would consist of blue pills, sedatives, anti-acids, iodine in some of its forms, and afterward tonic medicines.\" This appears in a volume which was formerly in the hands of almost all who were interested in Aural Surgery: it was the hand-book to which most men referred, the guide whose authority was sufficient for all. But serious would be the consequence if every constitution were thus indiscriminately treated. I myself would establish a new and healthy action of the mucous membrane, and also endeavor to excite their nervous energy so that obstruction of the Tuba Eustachiane should not hinder the ingress of the air through the cavity of the tympanum, as this is considered generally destructive to the sense of hearing.[To be continued.]"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/03/archives/surgical-and-practical-observations-on-the-diseases-of-the-ear-with.html", "headline": "SURGICAL AND PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE DISEASES OF THE EAR, WITH THE NEW MODE OF TREATING DEAFNESS.; TO WHICH IS ADDED AN APPENDIX.

Specifics for all the ills of life have been discovered daily and hourly; and if the public Press is to be taken as our guide -- for not a sheet issues from the Press but amongst the advertisements will be found the bold assertion of some loud proclaimer of his power -- unguents, liniments lotions and injections are all brought before the astonished world as possessing infallible power for curing the deaf.

He has never been known to fail, according to his own assertion; and what chance has he who has devoted his life to inquiry, has honestly to confess that the deviations of nature surpass his expectations, that her ways are often Inscrutable, and all he can do is to study, to learn, and to attempt to cure, without professing that every malady is subjected to his superior skill?It is generally first necessary, even in acute diseases of the ear, to make a proper investigation. This is the plan I myself generally pursue for eliciting all the particulars, and which is pursued by all the aurists in Europe, so as to be acquainted with every particular previous to forming a diagnois of the disease of the ear.First -- State of health; temperament; if any relations are deaf; duration of the affection; supposed cause; if it has increased by Hidden paroxysms or by imperceptible degrees; examination of the hearing distance; surface of the mcmbrana tympani; if air is heard, by means of the Otoscope, to enter the tympanic cavity; state of mucous membrane of the fauces; previous treatment; it discharge from ear; quantity and condition of the cerumen state of the dermis and osseous walls.This examination will acquaint us if we possess means by which we can alleviate the suffering, and sometimes gain time, and give the system, which has suffered from sympathy, time to recover. We must oftentimes devote as much consideration to the the means of palliation as to those of cure; and we shall find that we often gain reputation from the public, and estimation in The eyes of our patients, from affording them momentary benefit, as much as from complete restoration to hearing.Patients who thought themselves completely incurable, have actually been examined by others who pronounced the cause of their deafness to be perforation of the tympanum. After a careful examination, I found the impediment to arise from a diminished supply of cerumen or wax, which caused a dry, rustling sound in the ear, particularly during mastication, as well as ringing noises in the head, unaccompanied by pain in the organ itself, but a dull sensation, and, extraordinary as it may appear, there was a total absence of noise when the atmosphere was clear; and, by exciting a due quantity of secretion, I restored their perfect hearing.As this diseased or disordered condition of the cerumenous glands is often symptomatic of constitutional affections, so it is therefore requisite not only to inspect the parts engaged in the local malady, but also to ascertain, if possible, the primary cause of the complaint, whether it be local or general, and to inquire into the diseases to which the patient may be subject; in fact, to ascertain thoroughly, as I said above, the history of the case, before the practitioner proceeds to treatment, or subjects his patient to syringing, which should not be practiced in any case, as a matter of course, but only after ascertaining that the [???] contains extraneous matters which cannot be removed by any other means.It often happens that the symptoms of deafness -- noises in the ears, &c. -- are present in two opposite cases, namely, when there is a redundancy of wax and a consequent impaction, and where there is a deficiency of wax, with or without a pathological change in the character of the [???]eramen. In this latter case syringing will cause mischief; indeed, many instances have come under my notice in which injury has been done by indiscriminate and prolonged use of the syringe.Most urgently do I recommend those who are afflicted with deafness, however slight the impediment may seem, however easily it may be cured by an experienced aurist, never to have recourse to a syringe. They may be assured, though, there may be a vast number of instances in which no sad consequences has attended upon the syringing; yet there are so many and such serious, events which arise out of it, that no one who has regard for his hearing and for the comfort of not suffering from a noise in the head, should venture upon it. One sad termination outweighs a whole catalogue of fortunate escapes; for it has frequently happened that water forcibly thrown against the membrane, when unprotected by wax or a foreign body, has produced injurious effects which have been more or less lasting. The empirical syringing, the unscientific employment of tins frequently valuable remedy, has often excited acute disease in a predisposed tympanum, and has even induced fatal results. I therefore conceive it of more importance than any rules I may lay down; it is a maxim which I would have a starling taught to repeat; it is a sentence which should be repeated to everyone suffering from deafness or noises in the head; it is a voice which should be echoed on every occasion -- \"Be careful not to use the syringe to your ears!\" If, after such a warning, there should be any venturesome enough to neglect it, the danger be upon their own heads; but the repentance will come too late.I give such original views as present themselves to my mind; and if, upon mature reflection, I think it right to express any opinions which may be at variance with those generally received, I hope that the desire I have in view, of being useful, will plead my excuse. I shall have fulfilled my anxious desire to be of use to my fellow-beings if I am the means of inducing parents to take proper precautions, and of alleviating those sufferings to which so many are victims.It would be \"misplaced here to allude to and describe the operation as I am in the habit of per forming it, in order to show its great practical value, not only in the treatment of partial deafness, but affording pretty certain means of restoring the hearing in the most obstinate deafness; I will therefore: postpone it to a chapter hereafter.The celebrated Abbe CARTON, director of the Institute of the Deaf and Dumb of Brussels, to whom the instruction of the deaf and dumb owe so much, succeeded in developing to such a remarkable degree the intelligence of a poor girl, deaf, dumb, and blind, by merely placing his finger on the larynx of the unfortunate, that she could not only hear sounds, but distinguish everything that was said. It seemed as if nature wished to demonstrate that, by depriving her of so much, it still recompensed for all by a mere freak.Medicine has hitherto had little or no share in the attempt of curing deafness; it has always been sounds and vibration, and nothing more. The celebrated ITARD tried no other means to restore hearing than by accustoming it to a succession of sounds from metal or wood; but our object is to accustom it to the human voice, in which all of these experiments have failed, and it has disheartened, at the end of a long practice, physicians who began with enthusiastic hopes. This shows that the hearing, an organ so delicate, an instrument so perfect, is a much better appreciator than all the acoustical instruments of the elements of sound and of the human voice. What we have to consider is the possibility of being able to reestablish the sense of hearing to such a degree as to be sufficient for the deaf to hear themselves and others speak, so that they may be able to enter into oral communication.Mr. SAUNDERS, in his work entitled The Anatomy and the Diseases of the Ear, says: \"That the causes of the loss of hearing are involved in the greatest obscurity, and that we are almost destitute of information concerning the morbid changes to which the ear is liable;\" and in expressing the impossibility of curing any of the internal parts in the ear by manual operation, says: \"It by no means follows that such cases are irremediable many morbid changes of the vital organs of the body equally inscrutable as the ear in the living subject, are, when we know the symptoms indicating their existence, successfully treated by the operation of internal remedies; and I have no doubt that deafness, in various instances, depends on morbific changes, which are curable by the general treatment of the constitution.\"If Mr. SAUNDERS could be a witness of the progress of science in the branch of Aural Surgery, in which men of the highest medical education have since embarked, and diligent inquiry has been made, so as to enable us to restore the hearing to delicate and nervous persons without constitutional treatment, he would find that a great object, indeed, is gained. Still, whatever skill we may possess, and how much experience soever we may have, we ought not to be rash, but ought to reflect. It requires the utmost sagacity and vigilance on the part of the operator, as it may be necessary to stimulate by the Sulphur Fumigator, (for which purpose I had the good fortune to invent an instrument,) for the affected surface of the internal parts may be very extensive, and its sudden suppuration may be followed by giddiness, rumbling noise in the head, and even by more serious affections of the brain. For this reason, considerable judgment and experience are requisite, and no general rules can be laid down. There are many minutia upon which I will have occasion to dwell hereafter, because they are opinions which cannot be too forcibly impressed upon those to whom the enjoyment of life's best blessing is not only an object as far as they themselves are concerned, but who would guard the young, and those who are dearest to them, from encountering irreparable sufferings which, by caution and attention, may be avoided.There can be no doubt that the different states of atmosphere act upon the organ of hearing when there is a preexisting disposition to disease, as there is a texture of infinite importance which assists in giving pliancy and elasticity, and which is an essential part of animal structure; this is the cellular substance. From the lowest grade of vegetable life we trace this tissue, consisting of cells formed of delicate membranes. The first genus of organic products is thus constituted, an aggregation of cells entering into the structure. It is the medium of communication between the vascular and the nervous system. Some of the German medical men have of late investigated this subject with peculiar ardor. It is on this that electricity has a wondrous influence, most particularly in damp weather, when we are constantly giving up the natural electricity of the system; for such is the tendency to a general equilibrium of caloric and electricity, that the ear is continually in a state of change of giving off or receiving them. Few things are more thrilling than the appearance of the large sparks of electric tire and the loud crack which occurs when you comb dry hair, more particularly that of females, in the dark. The peculiar blue light is singularly visible. A long train of fire seems to issue forth, and not unfrequently this is accompanied by a peculiar tingling sensation in the Auricle. Deaf persons particularly exhibit this phenomenon -- deaf females more especially; and there seems to be some connection between the deafness and the nervous system generally. We find such persons more than usually listless, given to yawning, and incapable of following any pursuit with vigor. They are liable to glandular swellings, and to attacks of inflammation of the tonsils, throat. Eustachian passages, and to cause a morbid condition of the mucous membranes of the throat and ear, also obstruction of the nose, showing what a sympathy exists in these different organs, singular as such effect may seem. Every medical practitioner, upon looking over his roll of patients, will find confirmation of it.But the phenomena of the diseases of the ear are, as the inquirer into that branch of philosophy acknowledges, connected more or less with hygrometrical facts. In a work to which we have elsewhere alluded, as one from which most of the knowledge which Aurists have derived of diseases of the ear, is a very curious, and at the same time a remarkably well drawn up view of the effects of the atmosphere on the organ of hearing, exhibiting the influence of its pressure upon the system generally, and upon the ear particularly, being, as it is, continually exposed. The weight of atmosphere upon the human body is equal to TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY pounds, and therefore the pressure upon each square inch amounts to nearly nineteen pounds; if we then take the proportion of the ear, upon which the weight of the atmosphere is more or less increased, we shall find that there is, under certain circumstances, such increased pressure that the internal parts of this delicate organ must feel the full force. To those who have known what the simple exhaustion of a small quantity of air in a cupping glass effects as to the sensation of weight on the body, there can be but little difficulty in comprehending what changes may result front the weight of the atmospheric air upon the ear, and the effect that it has on the minute capillary vessels, and the small nervous febrilla, which exist to such an extent in the internal ear. This is a question, however, into which I have no inclination to enter; sufficient is it that those who are suffering from partial deafness only should be reminded that they ought to seek the means of relief which can be afforded them before they become totally deprived of hearing, as, according to the observations of ITARD, a certain number of deaf persons are not deprived of hearing, but only suffer from a feebleness of Audition, and that this natural feebleness becomes greater by reason of the total inaction of this sense, from whence results the natural demonstration that, in order to reestablish the energy of the ear, it is necessary for it to undergo a formal method of treatment. We have no hesitation, from our own experience, not only to con-firm what this great Aurist said, but we may add that there are many totally deaf persons who consider that not only is their case the worst, but give up all hope of ever receiving any benefit, and it often happens that they are the most easy cases for the restoration of hearing."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/01/archives/surgical-and-practical-observations-on-the-diseases-of-the-ear-with.html", "headline": "SURGICAL AND PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE DISEASES OF THE EAR, WITH THE NEW MODE OF TREATING DEAFNESS.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them.Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.As I wrote this work originally for the Sunday Times, and am now induced by my numerous patients and friends to republish it in the NEWYORK DAILY TIMES, for the benefit of those sufferers who are anxious to make themselves acquainted with their diseases, the mode of preventing and curing them, I will venture to make some remarks previous to placing my writings before the public, in the shape of an introduction.Habits of industry, which I know not whether to attribute to chance or design, have enabled me to compose, for my own use, the description of diseases in my own specialty, which I have found wanting in books; and diligence is a talent in such low estimation, that it will not be thought presumptuous if I claim this kind of praise, neither will it be construed into affectation, if I declare whatever excellence I have attained in my specialty, arises from merel diligence, from perseverance and study and fidelity in observation, which I have studied both in books and by an extensive practice by persevering industry. I may, therefore, presume to write in plain and simple language descriptions of diseases of the ear, and rules of my own mode of treating deafness, such as men of experience and good sense will acknowledge and receive. My specialty, I hold it to be my privilege and undisputed right, to discuss with unlimited freedom, having no master but my own diligence. I owe allegiance to none; but I have ever cherished an enthusiasm for the specialty to which I am devoted. I have entitled my work \"Observations,\" because experience is observation founded on previous knowledge; but to prepare the mind of a young practitioner for receiving the lessons of experience he must have the science so digested, and its principles so displayed, as to receive, in one view the natural and healthy structure of parts; the changes produced by disease, the probable issue of those changes, and the remedies and operations by which ill consequences may be prevented. To conceal the satisfaction I must naturally feel in laying before an indulgent and discerning public the observations of my own experience, resulting from an extensive and continuous practice, would savor more of hypocrisy than modesty; as I must acknowledge that I entered upon this with the sincere hope of being useful, but to imagine such writing perfect is a thought so vain and puerile, as I believe my worst enemy will not accuse me of, but I do claim that indulgence which I know I need. I make my appeal from the criticisms of those who have their purposes and jealousies, to a profession learned and liberal, and too widely diffused to feel any influence.But a specialty like mine, depending thus on opportunity, on accident, on time, which few can spare, and on that incessant dilligence which is so apt to flag in the toils of daily practice and needful gain, are often imperfect even in the end of life: and when, by continued diligence, a man attains a competent degree of knowledge for the ordinary duties of this specialty, the knowledge thus acquired enters into his experience as an individual, and constitutes his reputation. While he lives it is profitable and honorable to himself, and useful to his friends; but when he dies, it dies with him, and is not preserved for the improvement of science.When natural philosophers began to systematize and divide the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms into classes, genera and species, the medical profession in the different schools of Europe followed their example in the arrangement of disease, and CULLEN led the way to a nosological classification, which has become familiar to all the students of medicine; and it has been the aim of those who have wished to combine simplicity with facility of comprehension, to bring together the diseases of organs into such a system as to enable every one to understand it, and to add his own experience to that of others who have already been practically engaged on the subject. It has been proposed to divide all the organs into specialties.The mechanism of each organ of sense has been acknowledged by every one capable of examining them, to be calculated to excite the wonder and admiration of all intelligent beings. The beautiful adaptation of each organ to perform the functions for which it was destined, has struck every inquirer into the harmony of nature: and although in investigating the causes and effects of disease and decay, we may be baffled in many of our researches, we are permitted to collect together a vast mass of facts which still further inspire a love of knowledge, and an ardent desire to become acquainted with as much as our intellectual powers are capable of acquiring. This curiosity, properly stimulated, has led to the culture of those sciences deeply important to mankind, which are known under the name of medicine. A number of the most intelligent members of society have handed down from age to age, means by which suffering may be alleviated and life prolonged; but many have been scarcely touched upon, either from the rarity of their occurrence or from their being considered unworthy the attention of men of superior intellect. Among the affections to which we are liable, but which have scarcely met proper investigation, are the diseases of the most delicate organ of the human frame -- the ear. And I may be allowed to say that I hold all works on the diseases of the ear to be of little value wherein reference to them mucous membrane, the inner skin, as it were, of the internal cavities of the body, is not imprinted on almost every page, and up to this moment no such work exists.To those affected with deafness, the reflection appeals with peculiar force, as they are deprived not only of our most refined and exquisite enjoyments, but debarred from interchange of ideas which is essential to the cultivation and improvement of our understanding. To prove that the organ of hearing is of vital importance, we will relate the following fact: A banker of high standing in Vienna, of the greatest affluence, was suddenly deprived of the sense of hearing, and of course became disqualified to pursue his occupations, and is now reduced to a state of destitution, as well as depressed by the nature of the disease.The neglect, indeed, manifested by many sufferers laboring under deafness, and their procrastination in seeking relief, is astonishing, and often fatal errors may be traced to existing prejudice against undergoing any kind of treatment. Many patients who came to consult me, to my censuring them for neglect of an earlier application to me, I received as answer: \"Doctor, I should have come before, but I was afraid of being made worse.\" Happily, of late years, such attention has been paid to this branch of medicine as cannot fail to benefit mankind, and must be the means of rescuing it from the opprobrium which has been attached to it.If we carefully survey the history of the rise and progress of AURAL surgery as a distinct branch of surgical science, it will be perceived that the main cause of the obscurity into which it had fallen may be traced to the neglect which has prevailed as to the structure and physiology of the important parts of this organ, which have not been so universally investigated as those of the eye, nor the laws of sound become so familiar to the mind as the complicated phenomena of light, on the ground of the deep and unreachable parts of this delicate organ, which are imbedded in the cranium, and the extreme intricacy of its formation, which is moved only as a part of the whole head. We admire its most perfect condition, and are delighted with its most elaborate construction.Indeed, the structure of the organ of hearing is exceedingly beautiful, and well worthy the study of all who love to watch the never-ending wonders of our fabric, each of which seems to have been framed to lead us on to further inquiries. Whenever we examine anatomically any apparatus, and study for what the different contrivances are manifestly intended, we are struck with the simplicity of apparently the most complicated arrangement. We see that were the organ of hearing differently made, it could not adapt itself to the various functions for which it is destined.In man, and all the higher animals, there are five special organizations: TOUCH, TASTE, SIGHT, HEARING and SMELL, usually known by the appellation of senses. They are the means by which we obtain a consciousness of the individuality of our own bodies, and of the existence of a material world distinct from ourselves. \"Without the presence of these organs of sense,\" says a great author, \"we should have no knowledge of an external world, no appreciation of the present, no recollection of the past, no anticipation of the future, neither idea of a Creator nor aspiration for an hereafter. Nutrition, digestion, respiration, secretion, growth and decay, the birth and death of the individual, the propagation and continuation of the species, might all go on as well as they do now; but there would be neither perception nor conscientiousness. The character of animals would cease to exist, only that of vegetable would remain.\"It has justly been remarked that medical men too readily allow that \"they know very little concerning the treatment of deafness.\" In the present day we find a large portion of the community, from the highest to the lowest, suffering from deafness, so much so that, in some cases which have come under my care, the speech has been seriously affected, arising from the inattention of surgeons to this most important organ; although at the period at which medical science may be said to have dawned, the greatest of English physicians, SYDENHAM, expresses his anxiety that skillful surgeons should devote their attention to this almost neglected portion of their duties. And amply will the inquirer be repaid by the information which be must gain, and the power he will possess of being a contributor to the happiness of mankind.If talent and power were devoted to the inquiry of the singular construction of the organ of hearing, its extraordinary arrangement of parts, its uses in the great economy of nature, we may affirm that it would afford a subject of ingenious speculation, and admiration of Him that framed it. It would require little skill to show that our enjoyment of intellect, and our capability of deriving from creation around us the sweetest blessings of nature, are mainly conveyed to us by the sense of hearing. Physiologists have, with praiseworthy diligence, examined into the anatomy of the Ear, both with a view to becoming acquainted with the structure and with the uses for which it is destined; but, although there have been dissections and minute microscopic examination, we find that we are not completely conversant with all the matters connected with it. The interesting investigations pursued by Dr. HUSSON and the late immortal ITARD, both of Paris, have not sufficiently elucidated a subject still wrapt in much obscurity. We see that \"the precise use of the semicircular canals is not yet understood,\" as one of our authors says; \"that it cannot be doubted that they assist in conveying or strengthening the sonorous impulses.\" Beyond this, their curious irregularities must remain a mystery. We have, however, obtained sufficient knowledge to explain most of the phenomena which we witness, which are liable to certain deviations from the normal state, and which are productive of pain and disorder.It would be digressing too far to enter upon an investigation of the philosophy of sound, or the nature of those impressions which, through the medium of the nerves, are made by it on the brain. I must, therefore, confine myself to the structure of the ear; to the manner in which the nerve is expanded to receive the intensity of vibrations. The ear is divided into four portions. DEBLAINVILLE, who has probably given to the scientific world the most accurate and simple history of the comparative anatomy of the ear, confirms the following division of the apparatus:1. The essential or fundamental portion the VESTIBULE.2. The part for perfect hearing: the SEMICIRCULAR CANALS and COCHLEA.3. The portion occasioning unison and strength in sounds: the TYMPANUM.4. The accessory part for the reception of the sonorous sounds: the EXTERNAL EAR.This division, being founded upon the comparative development in the animal series, is correct, and is, moreover, eminently useful in studying the economy of the ear; it is found not only that one division is superadded to the rest in accordance with the increased necessity of the sense, but that each division becomes also more complicated, till it reaches its perfection in the human ear.During the first access of deafness there is little or no suffering, because the thickening of the tympanum defends the more delicate fibres, and even increases the quantity and quality of the secretion, and for a time shields the nerves: and it is only from neglect that the deafness, with its train of consequences, the sympathy of the rest of the organ, follows a series of alterations which fully develops the entire loss of hearing, and the nervous febrilla is acted upon, and the rete mucosum becomes the seat of the apparent disease. It is like dropsy: the accumulation of water is not the disease, but the alteration in the termination of arteries or of veins by which the fluid is deposited; and he who believes that by the evacuation of the fluid he does more than afford relief to the system, errs both in his reasoning and his practice.It is impossible to be enabled to account philosophically for the effect of heat and cold upon the hearing, but it is easy to point out that it is necessary to take some precautions, as soon as it is felt like a fullness or expansion in the ear, and that those who are negligent because there is no immediate bad symptom, may suddenly, even from change of weather, become so painfully deaf, that it will prevent them from following their avocations. Months, nay, years may sometimes pass by, and trifling inconvenience only arise; but as age creeps on, as the system becomes less capable of self-restoration after disease, as the auditory passage, which has a tendency to weakness, gets affected, and as this passage is occasionally much curved, there is, therefore, great difficulty experienced in obtaining a view of the membrana tympani, which, by early application for assistance, can be easily prevented; and if, on the contrary, long neglected, it will not only cause the thickening of the tympanum, and get the small bones of the ear, with their nerves, affected, but complete obliteration of the Eustachian Tubes may ensue. Diseases of the auricle are much more frequent in children than in persons of mature age, the supply of the fluids being then abundant. As we advance in life the ear is more scantily supplied, and thus it is that diseases of the auricle and auditory passage pertain more especially to youth, whilst disease of the tympanum and labyrinth, are the attendants of manhood and old age. The young should therefore not neglect the least impediment in their ear whilst the cure is within their reach, for it will grow with their growth, and they will be deaf when they are most anxious to hear. And those who are advancing in life should bear in memory that their defects are soon aggravated and more difficult to remedy; that the renovating powers lose their vigor as time creeps on, and therefore none should delay. They will find they are destined, like the rest of the race of man; and it must be borne in mind that the affection of the organ of hearing will invariably not be single in its unhealthy condition, as it naturally affects the THROAT, the MIND, and ultimately the SPEECH. Fortunate, indeed, is it that deafness can be remedied; and, as the means lay within our grasp, it is not to be neglected, but every effort made to combat it, and pass our time in social intercourse.The summary of great experience in the treatment of deafness I would willingly give in a few words, but there are many points which must be dwelt upon, for, without sometimes expatiating on them, they are likely to be speedily forgotten. I therefore have, and do, most strenuously impress upon the minds of all, that the earlier attention is paid to the disease of the ear the better. The moment that a noise in the head or a fullness in the ear is felt sufficient to attract the attention of the sufferer, it is best to apply to some experienced surgeon, as, when arrested in the progress of its early stage, it will most probably require very little attention, and is likely never to relapse again, although we know of cures which are spontaneously produced, yet they are rare. I have uniformly observed that cases which could have been, in an early stage, easily cured, and only from neglect such cases have proved the most difficult I have had to encounter, and that I have had more anxiety and uneasiness for the sake of my patent that I could willingly submit to. In fact, the most remarkable case of deafness, as well as the most difficult which have come under my care, would have been in their early stage of easy treatment, but either neglect or a want of judgment has rendered them difficult, and have demanded the most sedulous care. If, then, I am so urgent upon these points, I must fall back upon the experience which has taught me the necessity of prompt and active measures to make up for the slowness, the indolence, or the inattention of those whose duty it was to have gone before me. There is no one who does not think himself equal to give advice. An invalid has a vast variety of friends who have something or other to recommend which they believe to be infallible; and as for deafness, each person has his own undoubted plan.A curious chapter might be written upon the popular ideas which have existed with regard to the restoration of hearing. It would illustrate the history of the progress of true science; it would show how ignorance is led by pretended wisdom; how often superstition and the dread of some unknown agency, will induce persons to try, as remedies for recovering their hearing, the most extraordinary substances, and to place a firm belief in supernatural assistance. That those who feel only astonishment at the mysteries of nature, without any attempt to ascertain on what they depend, should blindly rush forward and grasp at any object recommended to them for the relief of their ailments, cannot so much surprise us, but we cannot withhold our astonishment and regret when we find men capable of penetrating a portion of the veil which hides from the world at large the region of truth, fondly and foolish placing their faith in inert substances, and having recourse to charms, to spells, and to various absurdities, when they might much more easily look for truer and for better things. In the list of medical authorities who have fostered popular prejudices, and perhaps have earnestly believed in the truth of their mysterious remedies, we find names of great eminence -- men who have distinguished themselves not only as the collectors of the experience of others, but who themselves have possessed both the power and the wish to investigate the value of medicinal substances.BOERHAAVE and SAUVAGES were not free from these faults, and there are many who have collected together the instances of their credulity. Can it be really believed that a professor in university of some reputation would instil upon the minds of his patients the doctrine that the lichens which are said to be found upon the body of a murdered person will cure deafness; or that another philosopher equally eminent should assert from his own experience that the hearing will be entirely restored by means of burning a thread which has been extracted from the linen near the arm-pit of a person executed for crime, and the ear to be kept over the smoke from the burning thread; and that another should prescribe the stealing of ten pieces of gold from ten different individuals, and to make a ring, which is to be put in the lobe of the left ear by the seventh son of a seventh son, and by wearing it the hearing will gradually return; the mucous issuing from the snail, the beyvar, should be a decided cure for deafness -- and many other sagacious ideas have issued from men's minds, and their believers have been tempted to follow their advice. Recently, a deaf lady was brought to my office in a fearful state, whom her friends had advised to fill her ears with salt and stop them up over night, and that she would hear the next morning. The head, throat and face became swollen to an alarming extent; the ears were so much inflamed that the whole face was excited through the medium of the fifth pair of nerves, which are distributed extensively through the superficial parts of the face and sides of the head, and which supplies the tongue, nose and eyes, and through the optic ganglion, the ears. I was fortunate enough to be eminently successful in restoring her to her former state. I could refer to a vast number of examples if I thought it necessary to add to the testimony which I here bear to the sad results to those who are rash enough to make such experiments. I am not fond of giving cases, for I am sorry to find that every empiric who practices any branch of the medical profession, fancies that the true source to employment is to narrate extraordinary cases, whether they are founded on truth or not, because he fancies the people will see sometime in what they read which may remind them of their own sufferings.The first idea which naturally presents itself to those who are suffering from pain or discharges from the ear, is instantaneous relief, and many are most willing to allow the fons et origo mali to remain, and again to be the fruitful offspring of the result of deafness, rather than submit to an operation, even for the sake of a permanent cure. Thus do we often find persons suffering from partial deafness who, when made aware of the dangerous result if not immediately attended to shrink from undergoing the only operation by which the hearing can be permanently restored."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/19/archives/from-the-newyork-evening-express-aug-17-gratitude-of-the-deaf-and.html", "headline": "From the \"New-York Evening Express,\" Aug. 17.; GRATITUDE OF THE DEAF AND BLIND AND SUFFERERS OF CHRONIC CATARRH.", "date": "1863-08-19T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from August 19, 1863,  Page 5Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

D.:DEAR SIR: We, the undersigned citizens of the City and State of New-York, who have experienced your unsurpassable skill, not only ourselves, but also our friends, the uniform success which has crowned your peculiar method from which we have derived so much benefit, is such that we have no hesitation in stating that you are entitled to the full confidence of the public.

We quote the following remarks in reference to it from the National Quarterly Review of June last: \"We have derived both profit and pleasure from a perusal of this volume, which is more than we could say of two-thirds of the scientific treatises which fall into our hands, and which it is our duty to examine, with more or less attention. The great defect of works of this kind, in general, is that, although they may be designed for the benefit of all, they are so overloaded with technicalities, that they can only be understood by the favored few -- those who can afford to obtain information from other sources, wherever it is to be obtained. The matured experience of the authors of the present volume, in the treatment of all varieties of diseases of the ear, has enabled them to obviate this difficulty; and, accordingly, such is the lucid, popular style in which it is written, that 'he who runs may read.' On the principle that prevention is better than cure, the means of the former are treated at considerable length; and those who expect nothing in the remarks and suggestions of the authors, but vague speculations, will find themselves agreeably disappointed.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/15/archives/important-news-particulars-of-the-great-battle-in-missouri-only.html", "headline": "IMPORTANT NEWS.; Particulars of the Great Battle in Missouri.

He came to New-Orleans overland by way of Houston, Brashear City, on Berwick's Bay, and thence up the Mississippi. There is no difficulty for a Southerner on the confines of the rebel States. If he obtains a pass at Memphis, he comes through unmolested, otherwise his baggage and correspondence are searched at Clarksville, Tenn. This gentleman represents the corn, grass, wheat and cotton crops of Texas as being very excellent - better than for many previous years. He also represents the sugar Crop of Louisiana as very promising. He says that nowhere, from San Antonio to the eastern borders of the rebel States, is there the least business doing - no sales, and no money in circulation. He says, also, that there is a large Union sentiment in Texas and Louisiana, and that the feeling is gaining strength.Col. FARNHAM, of the Zouaves, died at the Infirmary in this city this evening, at about 8 o'clock.TROUBLE IN THE SEVENTY-NINTH.The Seventy-ninth Regiment was, put under arrest this afternoon. A week since, it is said, an order was read to the regiment to proceed to New-York soon, to remain at Bedloe's Island for two months to recruit. The order was recently countermanded. The assignment of the regiment to the Sickles Brigade was another cause of dissatisfaction. Some of the regiment were opposed to their officers, and on Tuesday the men were paid off, and the drunkenness consequent upon this resulted in the open mutiny of the more violent. This afternoon the Provost Marshal proceeded to the camp with two batteries of artillery, a squadron of cavalry, and two companies of infantry, all regulars, and took possession. A proclamation by the Commander-in-Chief was then lead to the regiment. It recited the feels in relation to the disorderly conduct for several days; that they had been exhorted to return to obedience, but having refused, the authorities could only treat them as deserters and mutineers, and they must be dealt with according to military law. It then commanded them to lay down their arms, stating that those who refused would be shot down. The order was obeyed, and the mutineers were taken into custody and put into irons. The regiment was then marched from their camp across the eastern branch to the new camp. The ringleaders, 37 in number, are in the guard-house in the city.A trial of a new six-inch twelve-grooved rilled Dahlgren gun was made at the Navy-yard, this afternoon. The gun was designed by Commander DAHLGREN, to avoid any superfluous weight, and yet preserve the requisite strength for effective service. The experiment was conducted in the presence of several gunners and engineers, and was highly satisfactory. The firing was at the target 1,300 yards distant, the shot being a sixty-four-pound conical ball. The range of the gun is four and a half miles.There are at the Navy-yard twenty-three contraband negroes, men and women, brought up by the fleet of the Potomac. Sixteen of the number were taken from Machoduck Creek, to which point they had escaped. They have all been furnished with rations and set to work.Owing to the reckless indifference of the State military authorities, one of the most gallant regiments that fought at Bull Run is in a state of suffering. Over one hundred men of the New-York Thirteenth Volunteers, Col. QUIMBY's regiment, have neither pantaloons nor shoes, and are to-day walking about in their camp in their drawers, and barefooted. Same of the either members are only supplied with clothing by the contribution of members of [???] they returned.The wants of this regiment have been known by the State authorities for weeks, and nothing but promises have been received.The steam-tug Yankee has not been sunk, as reported.Senator CARLILE, who has just arrived from Western Virginia, states that the rebel forces under LEE had crossed Cheat River in two bodies, five thousand by the road from Staunton, and another body by the road from Lewisburgh. They were within fifteen miles of Gen. ROSECRANS' position, near Cheat Mountain Pass, which commands the two roads.Navigation has at last been resumed on the Ohio and Chesapeake Canal, five boats having arrived to-day at Georgetown.The New-York Evangelical Alliance, through a Secretary, to-day laid before the War Department a request that no more battles be fought on the Sabbath; that no more parades or drills be had on that day, and that each regiment be mustered once on each Sunday for Divine service.RICHARD E. MORSE, of Iowa, was to-day appointed Commercial Agent at Curacoa, in place of MOSES JESSURUN. This removal was made because Mr. JESSURUN failed to protest against the admission to the Port of Curacoa of the pirate steamer Sumpter.The Secretary of State will demand of the Government of the Netherlands an explanation of the admission of the pirate steamer Sumter to the port of Curacoa.It is probable that the examination of Ex-Minister FAULKNER, on a specific charge of treason, will take place to-morrow.Minister MOTLEY sails for Europe in the steamer of the 21st inst.Messrs. NICOLAY and HAY being absent from Washington, the duties of Secretary to the President are performed by WM. H. STODDARD, Esq., of Illinois.JAMES E. WHARTON, former editor of the Wheeling Intelligencer, has been appointed Consul to the Fejee Islands, and Mr. ALFRED CALDWELL, the present editor of the Intelligencer, has been appointed Consul to Honolulu.A deaf mute, named HARDY, about twenty-two years of age, was arrested in Gen. SHERMAN's camp, yesterday, as a spy. He was very observing and inquisitive, and suspicions were at once aroused. He was conveyed to the city and placed in custody. He professes to reside in Russelville, Ky., and was on his way to visit friends in Liberty, Va. There is some reason for believing that the rebel leaders have resorted to this means of obtaining intelligence of the movements and strength of the Government troops. The New-York Seventy-ninth, (Highlanders,) have elected Ex-Governor STEVENS, of Washington Territory, as their Colonel.Ten deserters from the regular service, and a score or so from the volunteers, are now under arrest. It is thought a severe punishment will be meted out to some aggravated cases. One of the number has twice deserted from the regular service this year.Col. MCCUNN's Brigade is stationed at Bailey's Cross Roads, six miles from Alexandria, and his pickets are so near those of the rebels that they can easily converse with each other. A few days since, two of Col. KERRIGAN's regiment were shot by the enemy's pickets and killed. Immediately after, a body of our troops made a charge upon the rebel pickets, and carried off three men and brought them into camp. They were members of Capt. JONES' company of the First Regiment Virginia Cavalry. Capt. JONES then proposed that both sides avoid the shooting of one another's pickets, on the ground that it was a barbarous practice, not consistent with civilized warfare. Col. MCCUNN had an interview with Capt. JONES on the outposts, and this proposition was agreed to; and almost daily, since, the pickets of the two camps have been within talking distance of one another. On Friday night, however, our pickets were fired upon, and the lire was promptly returned, and one of the rebel cavalry was seen to fall from his horse. Col. MCCUNN sent for Capt. JONES, who explained that the firing was the result of a misapprehension - that the approach of one company of our force to relieve the other was mistaken for the approach of our regiment in force with the purpose of an attack.There is a prospect that Mr. SANDERSON's services aa an instructor in the science of preparing soldiers' food may yet be made available, despite the multitudinous windings of red tape which have heretofore been interposed against him. By one of the acts of the late session, authority is given to appoint five Inspectors of Subsistence, with the rank of Majors. What should prevent one of these being given to Mr. SANDERSON, and his being detailed to do the duty for which he is so admirably fitted?A slave who had come who his master to Manassas, from the Chattahoochee, Florida, escaped a week since, and came within our lines. His master was a private in the Quartermaster's Department, and he had heard him say on Tuesday before the battle, that sixty-five thousand rations had been given out that day. The troops, during Friday and Saturday, he says, arrived at the rate of two or three thousand a day. He states that the rebels were short of powder, and that no ordinary offence was so severely punished as a waste of it.Col. MCLEOD MURPHY's Regiment moved yesterday from Alexandria College to Hunter's Church, a point two miles north-northeast of Baileys Crossroads. This movement will place Col. MURPHY's pickets in close proximity to those of the rebels.Nearly all the residences in Fairfax County, belonging to families able to leave, have heen deserted, and when requisite, these tenantless houses have been taken possession of by our troops. The wanton destruction of properly by some of the volunteer regiments has done much to chill the feelings of Virginia families towards our Government, who had previously refused to acquiesce in the treasonable course of the State.DISPATCH TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.WASHINGTON, Wednesday, Aug. 14.The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, DOLE, is on the eve of leaving for Kansas and Nebraska on business connected with that Bureau.The Government has no official advices that other than half-breeds from the Indian Territory, west of the Mississippi, have entered the Confederate military service. The forts there having been evacuated by the United States troops, the Indians disposed to be loyal have been intimidated by the disunionists, or deceived by promises depending on the future for fulfillment.Outside of the above-named Indian Territory, the Aboriginees, so far as the Government is advised, have not risen against our authority, the occasional and characteristic outbreaks being confined to themselves, owing to the fact of the absence of the National troops to hold them in check.Two of the members of the New-York Thirty-second were arrested at Alexandria on Tuesday, dressed as Fire Zouaves. They were endeavoring, in that disguise, to escape with them to New-York. For this they will be Court martialed.The Secretary of State to-day, on the receipt of the intelligence that the pirate Sumter was permitted to enter the port of Curacoa, West Indies, ordered the immediate removal of MOSES JESURUM, the American Consul at that port, and appointed RICHARD E. MORSE, of Iowa, in his place.Brig.-Gen. SUMNER, commanding the Military Division of the Pacific, has officially informed Flag-officer MONTGOMERY, as well as this Government, of the existence of a report that Col. VAN DORN, of the secession Army, has been seen at the head of 1,300 men on the road between San Antonio and El Paso, from which it is feared an attempt to subjugate Lower California may be contemplated by the Secessionists. Capt. MONTGOMERY, in his instructions to the subordinate officers, says this must not be allowed, if it is in our power to prevent it. Therefore, should any exigency arise, you will promptly cooperate with the troops of the United States, or otherwise do all in your power to counteract and prevent the execution ot any such purpose by troops in the service of States claiming to have seceded from our National Union. Another official dispatch from Capt. MONTGOMERY says the Wyoming reached Acapulco on the 16th ult., en route for San Francisco, for the protection of the mail steamers and our commercial interests on the Pacific Coast. He ordered Commander BISSELL, commanding the Cyane, to proceed with her on that service. During Capt. MONTGOMERY's late cruise to the Sandwich Islands, and thence to Acapulco, he had neither seen or heard of any pirates in the Pacific. The prevalence of calms and light winds would render sailing vessels useless, and owing to the difficulty of procuring coal, steamers will not be employed. He had not at the time of writing received the form of the oath of allegiance to be taken by those connected with the Navy, but he had no doubt of the enthusiastic loyalty and patriotism of all on board his ship, (the Lancaster,) and had no fear that the honor of the flag would be impaired by a single exception.He incloses a communication from our Consul at Heilo, stating that a large spar has been found on the southern shore of the Island of Hawaii, and which may afford a clue to the fate of the Levant. Capt. MONTGOMERY says the dimensions given correspond with the Levant's masts, and he has instructed the Consul to obtain further particulars. Although, he remarks, it is probable all hands were lost, it would be a melancholy satisfaction to obtain something additional as to the loss of that vessel.Much excitement was occasioned this afternoon in consequence of the disaffection openly manifested in the Seventy-ninth New-York (Highland) Regiment, and the sending to their camp of a military force to act as circumstances might require. The result was the arrest of 40 or 50, who took a more active part in the insubordination. These were brought into the city about 8 o'clock and confined as prisoners, while the remainder of the regiment was marched to .the. Navy-yard under a strong guard of cavalry. An investigation of the affair will take place. Among the alleged causes of grievance are that they were promised a furlough, in order to see to the comforts of their families, and to reorganize and elect new officers to fill existing vacancies."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1861/04/18/archives/deafness-mr-james-cruikshank-editor-of.html", "headline": "DEAFNESS Mr. JAMES CRUIKSHANK, Editor of", "date": "1861-04-18T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from April 18, 1861,  Page 8Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

Mr. CAMP was authorized to collect money in aid of the above Society. The ladies felt that the following letter from the Principal of the New-York State School sneaks for itself, and we sincerely hope that all will respond to the call for help for these poor children of silence.INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB,NEW-YORK, Oct. 8, 1860.This may certify that I have become acquainted with the history, organization and object of the Home for Juvenile Deaf Mutes, situated on the Tenth-avenue and Sixty-second-street, established by an association of ladies, and placed under the immediate supervision of Mrs. DEVOE; and I take pleasure in saying, that it is an establishment worthy of the countenance and support of the benevolent and humane.Its object is to preserve from danger and the influence of evil example, in the streets, the deaf and dumb children of the destitute poor, until they reach the age authorized by law for admission into the Institution as State pupils, where they can be placed upon a systematic course of instruction, and trained up for the duties of life.So far, therefore, as this object is carried out, it cannot fail to commend itself to the judgment of the philanthropist and the Christian.HARVEY P.

THOS. GALLAUDET.The Rev. gentleman, after the customary preliminary services, delivered his sermon, from which the following statistics are taken: There are 75 families and 600 individuals, including 150 deaf mutes, belonging to the parish. During the past year the average attendance has been 450 to 500, of which 50 to 69 have been deaf mutes. There were 48 baptisms, of which 16 were deaf mutes; 30 confirmations, of which 11 were deaf mutes; 14 marriages, including 2 deaf mutes; 22 burials -- 2 deaf mutes and two children of mutes; communicants admitted, 22 -- 9 deaf mutes; received, 47; 16 deaf mutes; removed, 7 -- 2 deaf mutes, of which latter one was to be matron of a California institution for deaf mutes, and the other a teacher in an Indiana institution. The present members comprise 141, of which 43 are deaf mutes. One hundred and fifty-nine Sunday services have been held, and 247 services of all descriptions. The rite of holy communion was administered 16 times, and in private, 14 times; 185 sermons were preached; 60 children were catechised on 11 occasions. There are 450 volumes in the Sunday school library and 141 in the parish library. There was contributed $11,277 84 to the building fund, $2,308 50 to the support of the church and rector, and $153 47 to the sick and poor. The total amount raised for all purposes was $13,755. The plate contributions averaged $S2 75 per Sabbath. The sum of $43,000 is required to free the church from debt.The Rev. gentlemen sketched the progress of the movement for the religious improvement of deaf mutes from the time of his father -- the late THOMAS H. GALLAUDET -- in 1814, down to the establishment of this church. His father had first conceived the idea of offering public prayer to God in the sigh language. He had himself first conceived the plan of founding the church while at the bedside of a dying child -- a deaf mute. While engaged as a tutor in the New-York institution, he had started a congregation in the University rooms. Trinity Church guaranteeing the rent, -- $300 per annum. The first service was held on Sunday, Oct. 3, 1852, 30 or 40 deaf mutes being present. By the active exertions of Bishop WAINWRIGHT and others, a committee was appointed, and raised $714 as the nucleus of a building fund. Another committee, in 1853, raised the sum to $5,000, and still another, to $10,000, with which lots were bought on Twenty-sixth-street, where it was designed to build, and the church, was incorporated Sept. 11, 1854. under its present name. In November, 1857, the Church met in the Historical Society's rooms. In May, 1658, a public meeting was held, at which Bishop WAINWRIGHT and Dr. PEET spoke, and $1,000 per annum was pledged to secure the undivided attention of the Rector, (who had been admitted to orders in 1850,) and Mr. GILLAUDET left the New-York institution where he had been employed 15 years. In July, 1859, the Church decided upon the bold policy of purchasing this Church for $70,000, (in having been built for the lamented HALSEY,) and the first service in it was held in August, 1859. A sale of the Twenty-sixth-street lots for $18,000 enabled them to pay a substantial installment on their purchase. In the event of his decease, there were several deaf mutes who could soon he qualified to take his place, and continue the services in the sign language -- some four or five, being in orders at this Time. The sermon closed with an energetic appeal to the congregation to fulfill all their duties, and strongly advocated the growth of free churches.The Right Rev. Bishop of Western New-York, W.H. DELANCEY, D.D., was present, and participated in the morning services, and preached in the evening."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/24/archives/police-reports-the-case-of-mr-phelps-deafmute.html", "headline": "Police Reports.; THE CASE OF MR.

The church for which he asks has been secured. It is situated in Eighteenth-street, a little west of the Fifth-avenue. Its services are so arranged as to accommodate deaf mutes and others willing to aid them. In this way a sufficient income is derived to sustain the Rector and pay current expenses. In connection with this church, the deaf mutes have a weekly evening lecture upon matters of general interest, and a library. Situations for those out of employment are found. Aid is extended to those who need it, in times of sickness and trouble. In short, this church seeks, in every way consistent with its means, to do good among the graduates of our institutions. $10,000 will place it upon a sure basis. The church, on the ground of its special mission among deaf mutes, asks that this sum may be made up by the benevolent of this community. An effort is on foot to obtain one hundred subscriptions of $100 each, payable when the whole amount shall be secured. Thirteen have been received. Communications may be addressed to Rev. THOS. GALLAUDET, Rector, No. 9 West Eighteenth-street.NEW-YORK, March 29, 1860.APPEAL OF A DEAF-MUIE.GENEROUS PEOPLE: We come to ask aid of you. The people of our State have kindly given us the means of education. We have a large and noble institution, we have teachers, we have books. When we leave our school and go about among the people, we can talk with them by writing and spelling with our fingers, but we have no church in which we can worship God. If we go into your churches we cannot hear and understand your speaking preachers We want to have a church in which we can worship God with praying and preaching in our language, of signs, but we have not enough money to pay for a church, Will you help us? God will reward you, for the Bible says:\"He that hath pity on the poor lendeth unto the Lord, and that which he hath given will he pay him again.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/29/archives/from-albany-seven-city-railroad-bills-ordered-to-a-third-reading-a.html", "headline": "FROM ALBANY.; Seven City Railroad Bills Ordered to a Third Reading.

After debate it was lost, 36 to 76.The bill was then read a third time and defeated, 58 to 62.Mr. JOHNSON, who changed his vote for the purpose, moved to reconsider, and lay that motion on the table. Carried, 67 to 50. So the bill has still a chance, but there is very little prospect of its being revived.The afternoon session was occupied in the consideration of the claim bills in Committee of the Whole.At 20 minutes before 7, the House took a recess till 7 o'clock.The House convened at 10 minutes past 7 o'clock. No quorum was present when Mr. MCQUADE moved a call of the House.The galleries were cleared, and the doors closed.Members were brought to the bar and were excused.

Lost.Several motions were made to adjourn, and lost, the yeas and nays being called.The bill to amend the general Life and Health Insurance act was passed.The bill to amend the law in relation to division fences was lost.The bill to incorporate the Long Island Steamboat Company was lost, and on motion to reconsider, laid on the table.The Grinding Committee reported several bills to be moved forward, among which were the following:To reduce the capital of the Farmers' Loan Trust Company.The New-York City Tax Levy was amended by striking out the clause for the payment of judgments.The New-York City Charter amendment bill; to extend certain streets, and to confirm grants to land under water in the City of New-York, made April 17, 1850, and to extend the term of office of New-York Constables to two years.To authorize the Methodist Episcopal Churches of Brooklyn to sell the cemetery lands.To continue St. Felix-street, Brooklyn, and to close part of the old Flatbush road.A motion to adjourn was then carried under a call of the ayes and nays -- 51 to 37.Correspondence of the New-York Times.ALBANY, Wednesday, March 28, 1860.The Assembly was not in session last evening, the chamber being occupied by the Deaf and Dumb in giving exhibitions of their efficiency in the sign language.The Senate made a special order of the everlasting Schuyler County question -- the question that is always being fixed, but never will stay fixed. The bill was ordered to a third reading, and this morning was passed -- Ayes, 23; No[???]s, 1, I hope I shall be Considered orthodox in expressing the wish that this is a \"final settlement\" of the Schuyler estate.The Senate, this morning, did little or nothing of general importance. It took up the Pro-Rata bill, turned it over once or twice, and then \"progressed\" it until to-morrow evening, when it is the special order. It is considered virtually dead, but Senators must mouth over it a little.The Grinding Committee made a good start forward, reporting about thirty bills to a third reading. At this rate per day, there is a chance that about one in five of the bills before the two Houses may get through.The Comptroller made a special report this morning of the amount of stationery used by the different branches of the State Government in each year since 1848. The footings I have copied, showing the amount paid for, and the amount delivered:Years. Paid for. Delivered.1848........................ $408 18 -1849........................ 3,104 98 $3,486 281850........................ 4,584 87 4,661 831851........................6,559 34 6,271 461852........................ 9,542 02 8,501 651853........................ 7,846 10 7,756 051854........................4,010 36 2,725 031855........................2,165 38 1,972 971856........................3,705 88 2,608 021857........................4,128 85 4,092 091858........................4,222 97 5,382 041859........................ 4,578 65 4,789 731860 (Three months) ........4,506 00 1,093 92Total...............$59,357 58 $53,740 28It will be noticed that the principal sum of this discrepancy occurs in the three closing months of the last Administration, in which time $4,500 was drawn out from the Treasury on account of stationery, while only $1,093 92 was delivered. Where the balance of about $3,400 has gone, only the Stationery Clerk to the last Comptroller knows positively.By the way, the average cost of stationery for the State of New-York is not so great as to engender any particular fears that we shall go bankrupt on that account. Fifty-nine thousand dollars in twelve years -- an average of about $5,000 a year -- is not a large plum, considering the size of the State and the extent of its business ramifications. Were it not for the disparity between $9,542 02 in 1852, and the $2,165 38 in 1855, we should not be disposed to believe there had been more than the usual percentage of leakage in the expenditures for stationery.In the House, the order of third reading of bills went to the table this morning, in order to permit the Committees to make reports. Heavens what an avalanche there was! Bills of every conceivable kind, character and description, came thick and fast, until the Clerk's desk was one huge mountain of embryo legislation, in every stage of progress.Through all this mass, the bills to authorize the construction of railroads through certain streets and avenues in the City of New-York, were most conspicuous. They were, you recollect, by a vote of the House, referred to the Committee on Cities and Villages to report complete. They came back this morning, all ready for a third reading.The freedom of the Assembly Chamber was tendered to Ex-Gov. HUNT -- that gentleman being on a brief visit to the Capital.By a resolution of the Assembly, the Superintendent of Public Instruction is directed to investigate the management of the Institution for the Blind. No reason was given for this direction.The Ten Governors sent a communication to the Assembly inviting an inquiry into their system of dispensing public charity. They are likely to be accommodated in this respect to the extent of their desires. There have been some damaging stories afloat here, that would have induced examination had not the Governors asked it.The lobby is full again -- brim-full and overflowing. Among those in it I notice some that have not prevailed here much for the past two or three sessions. MOSES H. GRINNELL and SIM. DRAPER are in the cloakroom today for the first time in two years. R.M. BLATCHFORD is with them, but he is one of the fixtures since he was one term on the floor. These gentlemen are said to be looking after the political character of such legislation as is proposed having reference to New-York.Two weeks from to-morrow, and the hundred days will be up, gone -- chalked off on the blackboard of time. It is probable the session may last two days beyond that time, but it can hardly be prolonged over the following Sunday, as the days are scored off -- the old anxious look, that always betokens the winding up, begins to appear. They are sorry faces to look on, that dance attendance in the lobby now.

To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit or update them.Occasionally the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.THE STREETS YESTERDAY. -- The combined powers of the salt and sun have been at work upon the snow since it fell; and, yesterday, they had reduced it to that condition which cannot be described appropriately by any other word than \"slush.\" Whereever there was inclination enough, the water ran in mimic brooks. Thanks to the Croton Board, it could not find an outlet in the sewers in very many places, so it kent on its course until here and there veritable ponus were formed. At the junction of Canal-street and Broadway, for instance, it was unsafe for any pedestrian who was not provided with a life-preserver -- in the shape of India Rubber boots -- to attempt a passage. There were a few ladies in Broadway, whom the imperative necessities of their wardrobes, compelled to attempt shopping expeditions. Some of them felt obliged to cross Canal-street, and they would walk up to the edge of the pavement, look into the waste of waters before them with a melancholy gaze, turn and stalk slowly ana meditatively along for a short distance, like cranes on the banks of a country pond, and then beat a retreat altogether, or make a despairing dive for the opposite shore -- curb stone we should say. The same scenes were repeated in the vicinity of St. Paul's Church and the Museum. The polite Policemen here had their hands full, and sometimes their arms, for they were occasionally under the necessity of transporting animated bundles of dry goods from one side to the other of Broadway. During the early part of the day there was a full force of officers in attendance, but as the waters rose higher, in the afternoon, only a single one, and he at least six feet in height, maintained his position. The frightful condition of affairs at length awakened the attention of the authorities. Yesterday the City Inspector's entire force was called together and ordered to be ready for duty on Broadway at an early hour in the evening. Soon after dark several hundred carts and men appeared in the street, and the work of removing the snow and slush was commenced. At midnight the condition of the street had been very much improved, and it was thought that by daylight it would be passable. Other thoroughfares will be cleaned as soon as possible.MOCK AUCTIONS. -- Among the most wretched eye-sores that fester in the decent parts of the City, are those dark, triangular dens, at whose windows are displayed sundry watches of galvanized pewter, and from whose doors glower out upon passers-by a herd of swindlers, with faces of ungalvanized brass. It is a sad confession of the weakness and uselessness of the City authorities, which pleads their inability to purge these dens. And yet it is difficult to see what other reason can be offered for submitting to their continuance. The proposition before the Legislature for the most effectual punishment of this whole breed of villains, by making them forfeit to their victims whatever article they cheat them into buying and by fining them besides, it is to be hoped will be adopted. The fact that in a great city there will be many rascals, is no excuse for not diminishing their number as far as possible. Peter Funk is not alone an evil to his victim, but an intolerable nuisance to the public who must pass his door. The daily sight of the little herd of snakey faces that look out on the street from the mock auction room, is enough to inflict on the strongest moral sense an intellectual and moral nausea, which becomes chronic when the nuisance assumes the position of a settled institution, as this class of swindling seems to have done. Emboldened by toleration in by-places, the nuisance has broken out in the midst of the best stores and shops of Broadway. Within a red of one of these filthy nests, gallant policemen escort ladies fording the street, and swear fiercely at non-resisting coachmen. But no officer is found who will attend to the perhaps less agreeable, but certainly useful, duty of breaking up the nest of blacklegs and swindlers.OUR POSTAL FACILITIES. -- In this great metropolitan Zahara of public conveniences, when street-side fountains are only barren aggravations of thirst and coaches and cars are only boxes for packing human sardines; when courts are only avenues through which demands for justice slide away into oblivion, and public elections may be attended only at the risk of a broken head, in the dark corners where votes are cast, -- it is refreshing to witness anything like an attempt on the part of public servants to furnish any but extorted conveniences to the people. The green letter-boxes which have been distributed throughout the City, therefore, are hailed as oases, not on account of the color alone, but because they save many a pilgrimage, overland and by water, from the various parts of the City to that venerable temple in Nassau-street, at whose shrine many a tribute is paid to the postal divinity. Though letters of great importance will doubtless still be taken to the Office itself, yet the community will duly appreciate the new arrangement for the purposes of ordinary business, and be loth to dispense with it after they have once experienced its benefit; and the tired errand boy will bless the hands that thus save him many a journey through the almost endless town. If any community should be favored with postal conveniences that community should seem to be ours, which is the richest tributary of the national mail department. How suggestive of the postal income derived from New-York is that huge wagon with its six horses, which rolls through the streets under the imperial name of \"The United States Mail,\" the very driver whereof is no ordinary Jehu, but a well-clad and booted official, whose very coat seems padded with all the dignity of the United States.Among the arrivals at this port yesterday, was that of the British ship Cambria, Capt RUSSELL, from Greenock, Scotland, after a long and stormy passage of 60 days, during which the vessel split her sails and received other damage, having been blown off the coast in a heavy northwest gale. Capt. RUSSELL is the person who rescued Capt. LUCE of the ill-fated steamer Arctic, with Mr. ALLEN of the Novelty-Works, and ten other passengers, on the 27th of September, 1854, and who, after bestowing upon them the hospitalities of his ship for two weeks, landed the party safely at Montreal. Thus far, it is said, Capt. RUSSELL has received none of those tokens of esteem which generally fall to the share of Captains who have the good fortune to be instrumental in saving life upon the ocean. It is several years since he visited the United States, and coming at the present time, under circumstances of peculiar hardship, the occasion is thought to be a suitable one to make some fitting testimonial for the highly important service rendered the unfortunate commander and passengers of the Arctic. Capt. RUSSELL was the commander of the ship Jesse Stephens, which, when lying water-logged, at sea, was fallen in with by Capt. NYE, of the steamship Pacific, and he and the crew were rescued from their pe[???]lous situation. For this humane service Capt. NYE received a prompt testimonial from the British Government. The merchants have the case of Capt. RUSSELL in charge.[???] a lad 8 years of age, attempted to jump from a car of the Second-avenue Railroad Company at the corner of Eighty-third-street, before the vehicle stopped, and fell in front of the wheel which passed over his leg, breaking it in two places. He alleges that he told the driver to stop, but that he paid no attention to him....Mr. ANGELO BOXTRIM was driving a grocer's wagon in Third-avenue, near Fifty-eighth-street, when his horse became frightened, and running off upset the vehicle. Mr. BOXTRIM was severely injured, and was conveyed to his residence for medical treatment....Mrs. MOORE, residing at No. 99 West Twenty-second-street, while crossing Seventh-avenue, near Twenty-first-street, was run over by a horse and sleigh. The driver did not stop to ascertain the extent of the lady's injuries, but some persons who witnessed the occurrence went to her assistance, and after restoring her to consciousness conveyed her home.-- Several days since information was received from the Police authorities of Boston that a robbery had been perpetrated in a disreputable house in that city by a young man named CHARLES SEAMON, who immediately fled to New-York. It appears that a stranger fell into the hands of some gamblers, and was induced to play \"bluff;\" but as they could not win his money, they drugged his wine, and then robbed him of a diamond pin and $285 in money. On receiving information that SEAMON was in this City, Detectives ELDER and MCCORD traced him to a house in Grand-street and effected his arrest.-- Mrs. SARAH LIPPINCOTT, better known as Grace Greenwood, lectured last evening at the church of Dr. CHAPIN; her subject \"The Heroic in Common Life.\" Florence Nightingale, Lady Franklin, Dr. Kane and Capt. Herndon were the types selected by her to illustrate the quality she eulogized; and to the illustrations afforded by the lives of these, she added others, derived from extended observation and reading. The lecture was sympathetically and approvingly received by a moderate audience.-- The steamship Adriatic was taken out to sea by the engineer, yesterday morning, to test the improvements which have been recently made to her engines. So far, the result is highly satisfactory to those immediately interested. After returning to the Lightship to send the officers of the Company to the City, she proceeded again to sea, and will remain out until tomorrow, in order to expose her machinery to a more thorough test. A statement of the result will be given on her return.-- To-day Lent begins. Ash Wednesday, which introduces these forty days of fasting, is supposed to have taken its name from the custom of sprinkling ashes upon the head as a symbol of repentance for sin. Until Good Friday recur, balls and all fashionable amusements will be partially suspended.-- Rev. Drs. KREBS and POTTS and Rev. Mr. HOGE, of this City, are to participate, this evening, in the services attendant upon the ordination and installation of Rev. Wm. HOWELL TAYLOR, as Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church at Clifton, Staten Island.-- The friends of the Newsboys' Lodging-house will have an opportunity of aiding this excellent Institution for homeless boys, by being present at the Pupils' Exhibition of the Mount Washington Institute, which will be held for its benefit at No. 585 Broadway, opposite the Metropolitan Hotel, on Wednesday evening, Feb. 22, at 7 1/2 o'clock.-- About 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, MICHAEL KELLY, while engaged in repairing a skylight connected with the Art Union Concert-room, No. 497 Broadway, slipped and fell to the ground, sustaining injuries from which he died early last evening.-- This congregation, through a duly accredited deaf-mute agent, makes a strong appeal for dollar subscriptions to pay its indebtedness.

By an act of the Legislature, approved last March, the Board of Administrators were authorized to introduce printing for the purpose of instructing the pupils. This was done; and the Board say that the mute boys engaged in setting type and in press-work, have learned with two-fold the rapidity of speaking persons under similar circumstances; they are passionately fond of the occupation, and prefer engaging in it to any of their other recreations. Their teachers find that it furnishes an important auxiliary to the department of instruction; a good scholar and a good printer can be made of a mute sooner than it would be possible to render him either, alone."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/science/growth-of-sign-language-2-letters.html", "headline": "Growth of Sign Language (2 Letters)", "date": "2012-12-10T21:56:06+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "To the Editor:Re \u201cPushing Science\u2019s Limits in Sign Language Lexicon\u201d (Dec. 4): I\u2019m surprised that in an article about the nuances of language, ASL was contrasted with \u201ctraditional languages.\u201d ASL is a linguistically complete, natural language, and signed languages have developed organically in schools for the deaf, even when these languages were being actively suppressed in favor of \u201ctraditional\u201d forms of speech.Leah Anthony LibrescoWashingtonTo the Editor:As a biochemistry professor, I once had a deaf student, and his interpreter told me after class that sign language had no terms to distinguish \u201cuncompetitive\u201d from \u201cnoncompetitive.\u201d These are terms commonly used for types of enzyme inhibition.

Recent improvements in early detection of hearing loss in newborns, improved hearing aids, surgical implant devices and especially early intervention with parents have led to new opportunities to learn to hear.

Answer: because fluent language skills are vital to the development of intellectual abilities, and fluency is directly connected to ease of acquisition. Only natural sign languages like A.S.L. provide easy access for the profoundly deaf.The deaf community in Ireland had a high literacy rate until the schooling system changed from sign language to an English-based pedagogy in the 1960's. Literacy rates plummeted. On the other hand, literacy rates soared for deaf students in New Zealand and Nicaragua after the introduction of natural sign language teaching.LEILA MONAGHANBrooklyn, March 10, 1998The writer teaches linguistics."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/10/opinion/l-teach-english-to-deaf-940453.html", "headline": "Teach English to Deaf", "date": "1998-03-10T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "See the article in its original context from March 10, 1998, Section A, Page 18Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.To the Editor:I'm saddened to learn that Junior High School 47, New York City's only public school for the deaf, is turning back the clock to 1867, when all 26 schools for the deaf in the United States used American Sign Language (news article, March 5).About 90 percent of the family members of deaf children do not learn sign language.

The school will need to hire teachers certified in both American Sign Language and their academic subject areas. Yet teachers with such dual certification are in short supply.

George E. Pataki's proposed budget for New York State is enacted. The Governor has moved money for private state-supported schools for the deaf and blind to the general education budget and reduced the reimbursement rate to about 49 percent, to equal what public schools receive.This would shift the primary cost of educating the children in these special schools from the state to the local school districts -- which do not have the financial resources to absorb the costs.Eventually all the schools could be forced to close and the children placed in public-school programs based on financial considerations rather than these children's educational, communicative and linguistic needs.Placing students with these specific handicaps in public schools could reduce and perhaps permanently halt their development.

Otherwise, the opposition of many deaf people to an operation that can sometimes restore hearing seems, at best, odd or idiosyncratic. At worst, especially in the case of denying the operation to a child, it seems cruel.In my research for a book on the history of the disability rights movement, I found that fear of the cochlear implant comes out of the deaf community's well-founded sense of oppression. It is a reaction to more than a century of belief that deafness is a sickness, to be pitied, cured and eradicated. Americans born deaf have their own language, a sign language with its own grammar and sentence structure that is quite different from English. Using it, they built a vibrant 19th-century culture.But in 1880, an international conference of educators of the deaf rejected sign language in favor of oralism, the method of trying to teach deaf people to speak and lip-read. Speech, it was thought, was God-given and separated humans from beasts. If one did not have language, one was thought unable to reason and, it was feared, became easy prey to the devil. Deaf people would be \"cured\" and saved, it was argued, if they could be taught to speak. But oralism could be mastered by a small minority. As a result, deaf culture waned, and educational achievement fell.Even Alexander Graham Bell, considered the pre-eminent champion of the deaf of his day, saw the deaf as an emerging \"defective\" race. Realizing that the cause of deafness was often genetic, Bell argued in 1883 against the practice of educating deaf people in separate schools. These private institutions had given rise to a thriving deaf culture, and in cities across America deaf people had their own social clubs, theater groups and newspapers. Yet Bell saw this as ominous because it only encouraged deaf people to meet and marry other deaf people, and therefore give birth to more deaf children.Bell proposed a radical restructuring of the way deaf people were educated so that deaf students would be fully integrated into the hearing world, and be more likely to marry hearing spouses and have hearing children. Bell's progressive-sounding call for full acceptance and integration of deaf people only masked his dark eugenicist vision and the Victorian prejudices of the day.Only now -- with recently renewed study of American Sign Language and events like the Gallaudet student protest of 1988 -- are deaf people shaking off the setbacks of a century of efforts to eliminate or \"cure\" deafness. Yet at the moment of this newly flourishing deaf pride, science comes along with the cochlear implant.Some deaf people and their families, as you note, welcome this new technology. But others see experts from the hearing world once again presenting a model of deafness as pathology, as something that needs to be fixed or eradicated. The cochlear implant comes from well-meaning experts who offer it out of compassion. But, as the disabled know, bias about disability is trickiest to fight when it comes from those with good intentions. JOSEPH P.

More important, we believe there should be no immutable position on the issue at all. It is a matter of choice.Over the last 157 years, 99 percent of the pre- and elementary school students who have come to us have gone on to mainstream high schools; 90 percent to college. They are accomplishing this using listening skills and spoken language.Perhaps when they leave us, our graduates are no longer the \"typical deaf\" children who, according to Dr. Scott Liddell, \"can only acquire some English -- and that very late.\" But they are proof that Dr. Liddell's assumption is incorrect.Although we teach more students with cochlear implants than any other school, two-thirds of our students do not have implants. This is their parents' choice, not ours or anybody else's. That is the way it should be.Not the deaf, but some deaf people, oppose a hearing aid. That is their right. The parents of our students have made their choice -- that their child grow up listening through with hearing aids or cochlear implants and using spoken language. Every day, deaf and hearing parents of our current and former students tell us they can't tell us how thankful they are for the life style their children have earned. J.

A professor at Gallaudet University (a school for deaf students) asserted to your reporter that \"the typical deaf child can only acquire some English and that very late.\"I have been profoundly deaf from birth, I am a Ph.D. research scientist at a pharmaceutical company, I have published 65 research papers and edited a book, and I don't consider myself to be exceptional. Tens of thousands of \"typical\" deaf people, through appropriate training and educational approaches, have acquired spoken English skills that have allowed them to become physicians, dentists, lawyers, researchers, accountants, journalists, store clerks, office workers or otherwise productive members of society. The majority of deaf children are able to learn English, often as well as their hearing peers, when placed in oral or oral-aural programs, which may include cued speech programs.Why, then, was this professor able to dupe your reporter into quoting this patent falsehood? Probably because most deaf adults whose oral communication skills allow them to function within hearing society don't demonstrate, don't reprimand the outside world about the need to respect \"deaf culture\" and don't pen vitriolic diatribes against other communication life styles in the heterogeneous deaf community. It is understandable, therefore, that some reporters might not consider us to be as newsworthy as other, more militant members of the deaf community and their hearing proponents, including this professor.

As he says, 90 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents. But to indicate that cochlear implants give all profoundly deaf children useful access to the world of sound is misleading and could lead to disappointment and missed opportunity for good language development.A major predictor of successful use of cochlear implants is the age at which the recipient became deaf. The best candidates are those who lose their hearing as adults, when speech and language have been well established for many years. Even in this group the success Mr. Parton's daughter has had is found in only about 20 percent of the recipients.The group that benefits least from cochlear implants is congenitally or early deaf children, those who are profoundly deaf at birth or soon thereafter. There is scientific evidence that there is only one language these children can learn at a natural pace: that is sign language.Having sign as a first language does not impede a deaf child from learning spoken language. To the contrary, it helps. For these children, the decision as to whether or not to have a cochlear implant could be delayed until they, not their parents, can decide. MOISE H. GOLDSTEIN JR.

The spurt in research in this area is aimed at achieving a clinical application for the theory.But I am concerned that parents will be misled by the statements that deafness is difficult to identify in newborn infants and that it is unlikely hearing loss will be noted before the age of 12 months. We are quite able to identify hearing loss in neonates.Auditory brainstem response testing has been available for at least 10 years in most major medical centers. It is the standard by which otoacoustic emissions must be measured. This test allows for evaluation of hearing through electrodes placed on the baby's head, which lead to a computer. The computer assists the audiologist in interpreting the response to sound stimuli provided through an earphone placed on the child's ear.At our facility, and many other centers, newborns in the intensive-care nursery who are judged to be at risk for hearing loss, based on family and medical history, are evaluated using auditory brainstem response testing before they are discharged. Those failing the evaluation are seen for further assessment.Hearing aids are fitted, and appropriate intervention programs are begun as soon as testing is completed. This allows for intervention by 6 months. Any parent whose child has not been deemed at risk but who suspects possible hearing loss, can request an evaluation at any time.We are following the research with great interest, but children do not need to wait to be identified as hearing-impaired. Parents should be suspicious if their child does not turn toward the speaker, smile when spoken to, stop playing and appear to listen to sounds or seem to recognize mother's voice by 3 months.If they suspect a hearing loss, they should consult their pediatrician and request an audiological evaluation.

The hypothetical law firm would discover that the interpreter's salary was not a burden but an investment.Guess what? Deaf Americans engage in business, practice professions, convey property, bring suits and are in their turn sued. They are born, go to school, marry, have children, divorce, consult physicians, go to hospitals and die. In short, deaf Americans engage in every form of litigation-generating activity prevalent in this society.

Early intervention and training.I urge the Congressional Commission on the Education of the Deaf to support the 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act, an act that does not assume that every prelingually hearing-impaired child's native language is sign, or that such children need to be educated in residential schools for the deaf, but rather, allows each child to progress educationally at his or her own appropriate level CAROLYN E.

These children lack the knowledge of English and the skills of articulation and lip reading required to succeed.''In general, children classified as deaf have insufficient hearing to acquire verbal language and speech through audition alone. Often, with proper hearing aids and intensive language and speech training from an early age, such children acquire a satisfactory level of verbal language and the verbal communication skills of speech, reading and writing.The rubella epidemic of 1964 left scores of children with severe hearing impairment. Through my affiliation then with two major urban hospitals, I was involved with the hearing and speech habilitation of a great many of these children. Many who received hearing aids and intensive training at an early age, and were in a favorable speech environment at home and at school, acquired good verbal language and intelligible speech, succeeded in a regular school setting and later achieved academic and vocational success.Unfortunately, those who were enrolled in schools for the deaf and were exposed to the poor speech models of deaf children did not, as a rule, fare so well. In recent years, the situation has grown worse because many formerly oral schools for the deaf have returned to sign language and finger spelling in what are called ''total communication'' programs. Although such schools include speech training, we have found that children in such programs who have the potential for developing good verbal language and speech usually fail to because signing, instead of speech, becomes their habitual communication.In 1967, R. Orin Cornett, in an attempt to reconcile the differences between oralism (speech communication) and manualism (sign language and finger spelling), devised a system employing manual cues in the form of hand positions and finger configurations made near the face of the speaker which, along with lip reading, makes speech sound and syllable identification possible, and thus takes the guesswork out of lip reading. This is called cued speech, a brilliant concept that works remarkably well.I have modified the Cornett cues to make them more effective as a tool to improve articulation of speech sounds by children who are severely hearing impaired. Speech sounds when associated with these manual lip-reading cues and the letter symbols of a phonetic alphabet I devised assist dramatically in teaching the child to perceive speech, develop oral language, produce intelligible speech, and learn to read and write.Those willing to listen to the needs of deaf children would do well to acquaint themselves with the great advantages of cued speech over the failed traditional methods of the past. Turning the clock back to the 19th century, with sign language, deaf teachers and deaf administrators in revitalized residential schools for the deaf is certainly not the way to remedy the lack of knowledge of English and the skills of articulation and lip reading required to succeed for the child with severely impaired hearing.

Hearing-impaired children, even those whose impairment is mild and especially those at the earliest stages of language acquisition, require language in its most visible, easily perceivable and naturally reproducible form to achieve the intellectual and social potential of which Miss Brody speaks.The language of signs can provide hearing-impaired children with an accessible communication system with which to learn about and become productive members of (rather than just getting along in) their world. Its use with hearing-impaired children deserves equal billing with the use of speaking and lip reading.SUE LIVINGSTONNew York University School of Education, Health, Nursing and Arts Professions"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/29/opinion/l-where-chimpanzees-use-sign-language-151763.html", "headline": "Where Chimpanzees Use Sign Language", "date": "1985-07-29T05:00:00+0000", "source": "The New York Times", "text": "Credit...The New York Times ArchivesSee the article in its original context from July 29, 1985, Section A, Page 14Buy ReprintsView on timesmachineTimesMachine is an exclusive benefit for home delivery and digital subscribers.About the ArchiveThis is a digitized version of an article from The Times\u2019s print archive, before the start of online publication in 1996.

There can be no question of a case like that of Clever Hans, the horse who early in the century was responding to his trainer and not counting (unless those who constantly seek to deny the intelligence of chimpanzees imagine that one of the five in the group is masterminding responses by the other four).''Kanzi,'' the star pygmy chimpanzee at the Language Research Center near Atlanta, ''seems to understand human commands,'' you say. ''He fetches diapers, hoses, spoons; all you have to do is ask.'' Well, the five chimpanzees with whom I spent a long lunch hour Sunday also understand English, but no ''commands'' are given in the study directed by Dr. Roger Fouts. When he asked to have a spoon returned to him, Loulis wouldn't do it, but Dar would. These chimpanzees have learned in an unstintingly friendly atmosphere, and they enjoy communicating with one another and with scientists and students.It is unfortunate that the excellent scientific work that has been done remains constantly under attack. Washoe, Moja, Dar, Tatu and Loulis are living proof that chimpanzees can and do communicate by American sign language.

Current laws requiring smoke detectors in New York State ignore the many deaf people and those who without their hearing aids are essentially deaf.Smoke detectors for the hearing- impaired trigger a strobe or other bright light or a device that vibrates a bed to awaken a sleeping person. The cost of these detectors is minimal, yet the potential to save lives is great.I have introduced legislation that would mandate such a requirement in Westchester County, and I would like to see this become a statewide requirement.

The comparison is petty and offensive.Deaf drivers, abnormally alert and with enviable safety records, are well acquainted with their situation. Not so the plugged-forsound drivers, whose blocked hearing is relatively novel, to say nothing of their diverted attention. MARTIN J. LEFF, New York, July 14, 1982"}]
