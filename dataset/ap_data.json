(AP) \u2014 Two workers were injured when part of a building collapsed at the Alabama School for the Deaf, raining down bricks and other material, authorities said. The failure happened Wednesday morning at the student center of the school, which is part of the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind, according to a statement from Talladega Fire and Rescue released on social media. The weight of a lift collapsed the floor below an area where people were working on the building, the statement said. The two who were injured weren\u2019t trapped and were taken for treatment by ambulance, but further information about their condition wasn\u2019t immediately available.The school said no students were in the area at the time of the accident, and school workers including a nurse and security staff assisted afterward. \u201cThe building structure is being evaluated to determine if there are ongoing safety issues. The building is currently secured and all affected areas have been blocked to protect the safety of students and staff,\u201d said a statement from school spokesperson John Mascia.Located in Talladega, the institute has six campuses that educate, rehabilitate and serve deaf and blind people."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/georgia-us-department-of-justice-4a038b822f6c5bfeb0749465534c9ab7", "headline": "Georgia hospital agrees to measures to help deaf patients | AP News", "date": "2022-01-09T15:58:08Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "CALHOUN, Ga.

It settles a complaint filed by a deaf patient.The patient said Advent failed to provide an American Sign Language interpreter or any other communication aid for her labor and delivery despite her requests. Instead, she said, she had to rely on lip reading and her deaf companion, who also had trouble communicating with hospital staff.Because they had no effective means of communication, the patient and her companion were left afraid and confused by a complication during the delivery, the Justice Department said in a news release.Included in the terms of the agreement: Advent will advise patients and companions of their right to aids and services for effective communication, including a live interpreter, either by video or on site, the release says. The hospital also agreed to pay $50,000 to the patient and $10,000 to the companion."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-high-school-basketball-7850c4e7e43d4b2d104ab507ec70465c", "headline": "Wednesday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2022-01-27T05:20:44Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BOYS PREP BASKETBALL=Ash Fork 50, Grand Canyon 42Corona Del Sol 70, Mesa Desert Ridge 57Duncan 59, Tombstone 38Joseph City 71, Red Mesa 44Lourdes Catholic 47, Tucson School-Deaf and Blind 38Odyssey Institute 67, Gilbert Leading Edge 65Parker 55, Kingman 51Phoenix Brophy 72, Phoenix South Mountain 54Phoenix Sunnyslope 57, Laveen Chavez 27Phoenix Thunderbird 82, Phoenix Shadow Mountain 54Queen Creek 61, Phoenix Desert Vista 50San Carlos 71, Eloy Santa Cruz 26San Pasqual-Escondido, Calif. 62, Phoenix School-Deaf 44St. Johns 61, Pinon 28Tempe Marcos de Niza 62, Chandler Seton 41Tucson Salpointe 74, Tucson Canyon del Oro 67Verrado 68, Agua Fria 53Wellton Antelope 57, Mountainside 24Williams 68, Mayer 31Yuma 75, San Luis 46Yuma Catholic 67, Tonopah Valley 43POSTPONEMENTS AND CANCELLATIONS=Sequoia Pathway vs. Veritas Prep, ccd.___Some high school basketball scores provided by Scorestream.com, https://scorestream.com/"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-lifestyle-nyc-state-wire-new-york-city-27cf48a4e6bf27b65cad886f979c4127", "headline": "New NYC mayor says kids safe in school despite virus surge | AP ...", "date": "2022-01-03T17:06:08Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 New York City schoolchildren returned to the classroom Monday despite a surge in COVID-19 infections over the holiday break, with newly sworn-in Mayor Eric Adams telling parents: \u201cWe are going to be safe and we will be open to educate our children.\u201dAdams, a Democrat who took office on Saturday, said at a Monday morning news conference that the city would power through the rise in coronavirus cases. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pivot. We\u2019re going to shift. We\u2019re going to adjust. We\u2019re going to get it done. That\u2019s the bottom line. We\u2019re going to keep schools open,\u201d Adams said.David Banks, the new schools chancellor, said the city has shored up its pool of substitute teachers and had administrative staffers available to pinch hit for teachers who are absent because of the virus. \u201cAll indications are that we\u2019re in a pretty good place right now,\u201d Banks said.ADVERTISEMENTAdams\u2019 predecessor, Bill de Blasio, announced a plan last week to reopen schools after the holiday break with increased surveillance COVID-19 testing and at-home COVID-19 tests sent home with students who have an infected classmate.Adams said his office is studying whether the city can mandate testing in schools, trying to determine if there are sufficient supplies and if Gov. Kathy Hochul needs to sign off on such a move. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in mandating testing,\u201d Adams said. New York City officials have said since the early days of the pandemic in 2020 that mask mandates, social distancing and other safety measures meant children were safer in school than anywhere else.Esther Farran said she felt fine about taking her 4-year-old daughter to her public preschool in Manhattan on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m not very apprehensive, and really, we don\u2019t have any other options,\u201d Farran said, noting that she and her husband work. \u201cAnd I see that this particular school takes good precautions.\u201dTrisha White said in-person school was far better for her 9-year-old son than remote learning was.\u201cHe could get the virus outside of school,\u201d she reasoned as she dropped her son off and headed for work, \u201cso what can you do? You know, I wouldn\u2019t blame the school system. They\u2019re trying their best.\u201dThe United Federation of Teachers had asked Adams to postpone in-person learning for a week to assess potential staffing shortages given the spike in COVID-19 cases. UFT President Michael Mulgrew said Monday that the union remains concerned about staffing. \u201cThis is going to be a very, very challenging week,\u201d he said at a news conference.Mulgrew said the feasibility of using administrative staff members to fill in for absent teachers depends on factors such as how many teachers are out. \u201cThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer,\u201d he said.New COVID-19 cases more than doubled in the city over the school break. In the seven-day period that ended Saturday, the city averaged about 36,900 new cases per day, compared to 17,180 per day in the seven days before schools closed for the holidays.New York City\u2019s public school system is by far the nation\u2019s largest with about a million students. The city Department of Education website listed eight schools that were closed because of the virus, out of about 1,700. School was canceled Monday in upstate Syracuse because of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and a lack of substitutes to cover absences. The district said take-at-home tests would still be given out at city schools.___Associated Press writers Michelle L.

Normally, the 67-year-old would have been sent to the intensive care unit. But Strukhoff said it was overrun with COVID-19 patients, and the staff instead had to wheel a heart monitor into his room and quickly administer nitroglycerin and morphine.\u201cA doctor I know pretty well said, \u2018Roger, we\u2019re going to have to improvise right here,\u2019\u201d said Strukhoff, who lives in DeKalb, Illinois.The omicron surge this winter has not only swamped U.S. hospitals with record numbers of patients with COVID-19, it has also caused frightening moments and major headaches for people trying to get treatment for other ailments. Less-urgent procedures have been put on hold around the country, such as cochlear implant surgeries and steroid injections for rheumatoid arthritis. And people with all sorts of medical complaints have had to wait in emergency rooms for hours longer than usual.ADVERTISEMENTMat Gleason said he wheeled his 92-year-old father, Eugene Gleason, into a Los Angeles-area emergency room last week for a transfusion to treat a blood disorder. It should have taken about seven to 10 hours, Gleason said, but his dad was there for 48 hours.He said his father called him after 10 hours, asking for a blanket. \u201cHe told me later, \u2019I just assumed they forgot about me,\u201d said Gleason, 57, who works as an art critic. \u201cAnd yet he wasn\u2019t the only person in that room. There were dozens of people\u201d But Gleason added: \u201cI\u2019m not begrudging the hospital at all. They did a great job.\u201dAn average of almost 144,000 people were in the hospital in the U.S. with COVID-19 as of Tuesday, the highest level on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hospitals in a few states such as New York and Connecticut that experienced early omicron surges are starting to see an easing of the patient load, but many other places are overwhelmed.Hospitals say the COVID-19 patients aren\u2019t as sick as those during the last surge. And many of them are being admitted for reasons other than COVID-19 and only incidentally testing positive for the virus.Rick Pollack, CEO and president of the American Hospital Association, said the surge has had a widespread effect on the availability of care for people who have non-COVID-19 health problems. He said a number of factors are at play: More people are in the hospital, and a high number of health care workers are out with COVID-19, worsening staffing shortages that existed well before the pandemic. As of Wednesday, roughly 23% of hospitals nationwide were reporting critical staff shortages, Pollack said.ADVERTISEMENTMany people are also unable or unwilling to seek care for symptoms that do not seem like emergencies, he said. Pollack said that has led to delays in diagnosing conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure that get worse the longer they go untreated.Dr. Claudia Fegan, chief medical officer for Cook County Health in Chicago, said some people, particularly older patients, have been avoiding checkups and other routine care during the pandemic out of fear of COVID-19.And as a result, \u201cthe patients we\u2019re seeing now are much sicker,\u201d she said, citing cases of advanced heart failure and cancer that might have been diagnosed earlier. Mike Bawden, a 59-year-old marketing consultant with a history of blood clots in his lungs, said he couldn\u2019t get an appointment to see his doctor in Davenport, Iowa, because his coughing symptoms were too similar to COVID-19. The doctor\u2019s office was concerned about the virus spreading to others.After nearly two weeks, Bawden went to a walk-in clinic, which sent him to the emergency room at Genesis Medical Center-East in Davenport. He said he waited almost six hours in an overflowing ER before he was seen. A scan showed clots in his lungs, as he suspected, and he was prescribed blood thinners.If not for the surge, Bawden said, he would have gotten a scan much earlier at a doctor\u2019s office.\u201cIt\u2019s always so easy to Monday morning quarterback the ER, but everyone was really nice \u2014 even the other patients,\u201d Bawden said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for folks to realize that nobody\u2019s the villain.\u201d Craig Cooper, a Genesis spokesman, declined to comment on any individual cases. But he said in an email: \u201cWe are not exempt from the challenges medical centers across the United States are experiencing because of significant impact from COVID. We urge individuals to get vaccinated.\u201dStrukhoff, who is a researcher for tech startups, said he arrived at Northwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Hospital in DeKalb for what he suspected was internal bleeding. He was diagnosed and given a bed in the emergency room. He waited there for six hours, feeling dizzy, before he was wheeled to his own room through hallways where people lay on stretchers.\u201cI was in no distress at that point,\u201d Strukhoff said. \u201cI was worried about clogging up the works in the emergency room and taking up a spot for other people.\u201d Christopher King, a spokesman for Northwestern Medicine, declined to comment on Strukhoff\u2019s care because of privacy laws. But he confirmed that wait times were higher than normal throughout the hospital system, as they are across the country.Strukhoff said that once he got his own hospital room, a colonoscopy revealed the bleeding. Doctors treated it by cauterizing a vein. He then suffered the heart attack while he was recovering. He said it took five hours for him to get into the ICU. \u201cIt\u2019s not something they were set up to do, but they did it,\u201d Strukhoff said of the doctors and nurses who rose to the challenge. \u201cThese people are heroes.\u201d "}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-arizona-phoenix-tucson-63c8003a499d116bbe5d2eadce7c4f6f", "headline": "Thursday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2022-01-14T05:29:31Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "GIRLS PREP BASKETBALL=Bagdad 27, Anthem Prep 18Bisbee 63, Elfrida Valley 20Cave Creek Cactus Shadows 48, Paradise Valley 25Douglas 70, Tucson Canyon del Oro 29Eagar Round Valley 79, Many Farms 14Glendale O\u2019Connor 40, Boulder Creek 28Laveen Chavez 51, Phoenix South Mountain 35Mesa 47, Mesa Skyline 35Mesa Dobson 51, Mesa Westwood 38Mesa Mountain View 36, Mesa Red Mountain 33Mountainside 36, Phoenix School-Deaf 24Phoenix Desert Vista 63, Chandler 34Phoenix Thunderbird 46, Cactus 22Scottsdale Christian 63, San Tan Charter 7Shadow Ridge 57, Tolleson 23Sierra Vista Buena 48, Vail Cienega 46St. David 33, Benson 32St. Johns 60, Ganado 38Superior 34, Kearny Ray 16Tucson Amphitheater 65, Sahuarita 63POSTPONEMENTS AND CANCELLATIONS=Buckeye vs. Phoenix Moon Valley, ccd.Desert Heights Prep vs. Cicero Preparatory Academy, ccd.Marana vs. Marana Mountain View, ccd.Metro Tech vs. Phoenix Hayden, ccd.Nogales vs. Tucson Desert View, ccd.Phoenix Camelback vs. Phoenix Central, ccd.Phoenix Christian vs. Basis Charter Phoenix, ccd.Phoenix Horizon vs. Tempe McClintock, ccd.San Miguel vs. Tucson Palo Verde, ccd.Scottsdale Desert Mountain vs. Phoenix Arcadia, ccd.Sierra Linda vs. Betty Fairfax High School, ccd.St. Augustine Catholic vs. Tucson Immaculate Heart, ccd.Tucson Flowing Wells vs. Tucson Arizona IRHS, ccd.Tucson Santa Rita vs. Mica Mountain, ccd.West Point vs. Phoenix North Canyon, ccd.Willow Canyon vs. Glendale Independence, ccd.___Some high school basketball scores provided by Scorestream.com, https://scorestream.com/"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-ontario-06ef457ca48e5f3842038d47d85efb88", "headline": "Tuesday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2022-01-05T06:56:32Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BOYS PREP BASKETBALL=Adrian 46, Jordan Valley 41Bandon 58, Coquille 38Canby 46, Scappoose 28Catlin Gabel 42, Portland Adventist 41Century 66, McKay 32Corbett 61, Sweet Home 34Cottage Grove 50, North Bend 41Country Christian 43, Mannahouse Christian 42Crater 55, Ashland 40Crosshill Christian 52, St. Paul 26Days Creek 48, Elkton 37Douglas 66, Umpqua Valley Christian 36Eagle Point 78, North Valley 32East Linn Christian 62, Lowell 31Falls City 59, Oregon School for Deaf 22Harrisburg 56, Elmira 47Imbler 60, Elgin 14Jefferson 59, Central Linn 58Joseph 62, Wallowa 20Junction City 62, Creswell 48Knappa 77, Faith Bible 29Lake Oswego 65, Westview 56Lewiston, Idaho 89, Hermiston 55Marshfield 63, Newport 55Myrtle Point 61, Waldport 35Nestucca 53, Gaston 15ADVERTISEMENTNorth Douglas 65, Yoncalla 30North Medford 100, Yreka, Calif. 47Oakland 59, Oakridge 25Payette, Idaho 73, Nyssa 57Pleasant Hill 48, Blanchet Catholic 35Regis 75, Monroe 58Riddle 58, Glendale 37Sheridan 69, Scio 49Sherwood 73, Sunset 57Siletz Valley 54, Eddyville 52Siuslaw 47, Sutherlin 20Southridge 61, McMinnville 37St. Helens 47, Yamhill-Carlton 29Tillamook 69, Taft 34Trinity Lutheran 82, La Pine 59Vale 58, Ontario 27Westside Christian 57, De La Salle 51Willamette 42, Grants Pass 38Willamette Valley Christian 62, C.S.

(AP) \u2014 West Virginia lawmakers have introduced a bill to ban abortion after 15 weeks \u2014 a proposal nearly identical to the Mississippi law currently under review by the U.S. Supreme Court.As the nation waits for the court to make a decision later this year in the abortion case that could overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade decision, at least two states \u2014 West Virginia and Florida \u2014 have introduced bills mirroring Mississippi\u2019s.Both the Florida and West Virginia bills  would prohibit abortions after 15 weeks except in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality. Neither would provide exceptions for victims of rape or incest.ADVERTISEMENTRepublican Del. Ruth Rowan, lead sponsor of the West Virginia bill, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that West Virginia has an obligation to protect the unborn as \u201ca Christian state where people care about their families and their children.\u201d AbortionMillions in tax dollars flow to anti-abortion centers in USMillions in tax dollars flow to anti-abortion centers in USArizona Republicans advance 15-week abortion ban measureNew Hampshire Senate rejects exceptions to abortion banRowan carries two wallet-sized photos around with her in the Capitol: One is of her 17-year-old grandson, a junior at the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind; the other shows him in a hospital incubator when he was born early \u2014 at 28 weeks. When Rowan\u2019s daughter was pregnant, she said, doctors told her daughter the pregnancy would be risky and gave her some options. Among them, they said, she could end her pregnancy. Rowan said the choice was clear. Years later, the family is grateful she decided to keep him. \u201cHe\u2019s our miracle. He\u2019s why I\u2019m so committed to what I\u2019m doing right now,\u201d Rowan said, speaking through tears during an interview on the House floor. \u201cLife is precious, and we need to respect that.\u201d Rowan said adoption is always an option for women who don\u2019t want to be parents, saying \u201cGod has a reason for all of our children.\u201d Like Mississippi, there is only one facility in West Virginia\u2019s state capital that performs abortions. That\u2019s down from 2014, when there were five abortion-providing facilities in West Virginia, according to the Guttmacher Institute.Katie Quinonez, executive director of Women\u2019s Health Center of West Virginia \u2014 the state\u2019s sole facility currently performing abortions \u2014 said the legislation would make abortion harder to access in a state where such access is already severely limited. Current law in West Virginia prohibits abortions after 20 weeks and requires women to undergo state-directed counseling and wait 24 hours before the procedure is provided. Parents must be notified before a minor receives an abortion. ADVERTISEMENTAs it is, women have difficulty making the trek to Charleston to have an abortion before 20 weeks because West Virginia is a rural state without access to robust public transportation, according to Quinonez. Further restrictions would mean hundreds of people would have to travel out of state for abortion care, she said. \u201cAbortion bans, by default, are racist, are sexist, are rooted in white supremacy, particularly the exploitation of Black women and controlling women\u2019s bodies and decisions,\u201d she said. Quinonez said abortions restrictions fall hardest on people who \u201care already marginalized by our healthcare systems.\u201d She cited people of color, young persons, low-income earners and people who live in rural areas. \u201cOur legislators should be working to expand access to healthcare for those marginalized folks, not take their healthcare away,\u201d she said. Quinonez said she had two abortions in West Virginia \u2014 one when she was in high school at age 17 and the other at age 22. During her first pregnancy, she was dating an older man who was emotionally abusive. She wasn\u2019t able to get her abortion until after 15 weeks. She said she had to try to save money from her part-time pizzeria job to pay for the procedure. \u201cThat\u2019s why this 15-week ban is particularly upsetting because I just remember myself as a teenager and how daunting that would have been to have been told, \u2018Well, you have to travel somewhere out of state to get the care that you need,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI knew that I did not want to be a parent.\u201d West Virginia\u2019s abortion bill has cleared the House health committee and will go to the judiciary committee. If it passes the judiciary, it will go to the full House.If Roe v. Wade is overturned, at least 26 states are expected to have abortion restrictions quickly go into effect or pass new ones, said Kristin Ford, the vice-president of communications and research for NARAL Pro-Choice America."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-oregon-portland-high-school-basketball-74661e1cadf6cdcab36e45fb7acdab69", "headline": "Wednesday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2022-01-27T05:59:47Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BOYS PREP BASKETBALL=Cascade Christian 64, South Umpqua 52Catlin Gabel 49, Portland Adventist 47Central Catholic 50, Barlow 46Clackamas 63, Reynolds 39Columbia Christian 63, Faith Bible 54Corbett 69, North Marion 50Crosshill Christian 72, C.S.

La ciudad de Nueva York, sede del mayor sistema escolar p\u00fablico del pa\u00eds, reabri\u00f3 las aulas a cerca de un mill\u00f3n de estudiantes con una reserva de kits de pruebas diagn\u00f3sticas de COVID-19 para llevar a casa, y planea duplicar el n\u00famero de pruebas aleatorias realizadas en las escuelas.\u201cVamos a estar seguros, y vamos a estar abiertos para educar a nuestros hijos\u201d, dijo el nuevo alcalde, Eric Adams, a la cadena MSNBC.ADVERTISEMENTTrisha White, una madre neoyorquina, dijo que considera que el riesgo es el mismo para su hijo de 9 a\u00f1os de edad dentro o fuera de la escuela, y que estar con los compa\u00f1eros es mucho mejor para su hijo que el aprendizaje a distancia.\u201cPodr\u00eda contraer el virus fuera de la escuela\u201d, manifest\u00f3 mientras dejaba al ni\u00f1o en el centro educativo. \u201cEntonces, \u00bfqu\u00e9 puedes hacer? Yo no culpar\u00eda al sistema escolar. Hacen lo que pueden\u201d.Aunque el sindicato de profesores solicit\u00f3 al alcalde que pospusiera las clases presenciales durante una semana, los funcionarios municipales llevan mucho tiempo diciendo que los requisitos de mascarilla, las pruebas diagn\u00f3sticas y otras medidas preventivas hacen que los ni\u00f1os est\u00e9n seguros en la escuela. La ciudad tambi\u00e9n tiene un mandato de vacunaci\u00f3n para los empleados municipales.Los nuevos casos de COVID-19 en la ciudad se dispararon de un promedio diario de alrededor de 17.000 en la semana previa a las vacaciones a casi 37.000 la semana pasada.Los nuevos casos de COVID-19 en Estados Unidos se han triplicado en las dos \u00faltimas semanas hasta superar los 400.000 diarios, el nivel m\u00e1s alto registrado. El brote representa una pesada carga para sectores vitales de la econom\u00eda, como los hospitales y la industria a\u00e9rea, que tienen un gran n\u00famero de empleados infectados."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-tucson-phoenix-basketball-c19dacb51d7ae87b596fc3ea00c92f2b", "headline": "Thursday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2022-01-21T05:53:21Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "GIRLS PREP BASKETBALL=Agua Fria 57, La Joya Community 35American Leadership-Gilbert 53, Ben Franklin 25Boulder Creek 36, Phoenix Pinnacle 25Cave Creek Cactus Shadows 57, Phoenix Horizon 50Chinle 43, Tuba City 36Ft.

(AP) \u2014 A once-prominent South Carolina lawyer now faces 71 charges that he stole nearly $8.5 million in wrongful death and wreck settlements from more than a dozen people after another round of indictments against Alex Murdaugh were handed up Friday.The 23 new charges issued by the state grand jury covered new victims but similar schemes, prosecutors said.Murdaugh, 53, would negotiate settlement money for his clients without telling them what they earned, then deposit the checks meant to pay for their pain and suffering or the anguish of the death of a loved one into his own personal accounts \u2014 paying off loans or debts or in ways prosecutors have not detailed.The new indictments extend Murdaugh\u2019s crimes back more than a decade to 2011 and add a new mystery. Several of them said Murdaugh used money orders given to an unnamed family member to get his hands on the cash, prosecutors said.ADVERTISEMENTMurdaugh has been in jail since October for the ever-growing list of breach of trust, forgery, money laundering and computer crime charges. A judge set his bail at $7 million and refused to reduce it, even as Murdaugh\u2019s lawyer argued his bank accounts were seized in civil lawsuits and he could barely afford to buy underwear at the Richland County jail. He has blamed his problems on years of drug addiction.Murdaugh\u2019s professional career began to unravel after his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, were killed  in a shooting at the family\u2019s home in June. Murdaugh\u2019s lawyers have adamantly said he had nothing to do with it and repeatedly said they hope investigators are working as hard to find their killers as they are untangling Alex Murdaugh\u2019s finances.Murdaugh is the fourth generation of a prominent legal family in tiny Hampton County.

Prosecutors have suggested at Murdaugh\u2019s bond hearing that they still haven\u2019t gotten to the bottom of his shady practices.Pinckney was Black, and most of the people Murdaugh stole from were like him \u2014 minorities and not well off, family attorney Justin Bamberg said.\u201cAlex gave them just enough money so they would drop on their knees and say \u2018thank you, Jesus\u2019 and took the rest,\u201d Bamberg said.Bamberg said Murdaugh\u2019s longtime law firm, which fired him after learning he was stealing money, his banker friends and other professionals who Murdaugh used as personal representatives for hurt victims and grieving families or who played other roles in helping his schemes go on so long should face consequences, too, because even if they aren\u2019t criminally responsible, they should have asked questions.\u201cWe are coming for your pockets. We\u2019re going to get all the money these people were supposed to get,\u201d Bamberg said.Another indictment Friday details how starting in 2013, Murdaugh collected 14 settlement checks totaling more than $1.3 million for a man whose wife died in a wreck and stole all the money for himself.Other victims have included a state trooper, family friends and an immigrant living in the country illegally, according to previous indictments.At his bond hearings, Murdaugh\u2019s lawyers blamed years of addiction to opioids for his behavior, saying he has sought counseling and wants to make things right for the clients he hurt.Murdaugh\u2019s law license has been suspended since his arrest in September after state agents said he tried  to arrange his own death  so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy.___This story corrects that Murdaugh now faces 71 charges of financial and other crimes___Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at  https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-academy-awards-tracee-ellis-ross-netflix-inc-5ea6d3cfe58d22f1f1b00f275b1ec8dd", "headline": "What to watch out for when Oscar noms are announced Tuesday ...", "date": "2022-02-07T21:48:36Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s time again to celebrate Hollywood\u2019s grandest ambitions and most daring risk takers.

(AP) \u2014 A once-prominent South Carolina lawyer now faces 71 charges that he stole nearly $8.5 million in wrongful death and wreck settlements from more than a dozen people after another round of indictments against Alex Murdaugh were handed up Friday.The 23 new charges issued by the state grand jury covered new victims but similar schemes, prosecutors said.Murdaugh, 53, would negotiate settlement money for his clients without telling them what they earned, then deposit the checks meant to pay for their pain and suffering or the anguish of the death of a loved one into his own personal accounts \u2014 paying off loans or debts or in ways prosecutors have not detailed.The new indictments extend Murdaugh\u2019s crimes back more than a decade to 2011 and add a new mystery. Several of them said Murdaugh used money orders given to an unnamed family member to get his hands on the cash, prosecutors said.ADVERTISEMENTMurdaugh has been in jail since October for the ever-growing list of breach of trust, forgery, money laundering and computer crime charges. A judge set his bail at $7 million and refused to reduce it, even as Murdaugh\u2019s lawyer argued his bank accounts were seized in civil lawsuits and he could barely afford to buy underwear at the Richland County jail. He has blamed his problems on years of drug addiction.Murdaugh\u2019s professional career began to unravel after his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, were killed  in a shooting at the family\u2019s home in June. Murdaugh\u2019s lawyers have adamantly said he had nothing to do with it and repeatedly said they hope investigators are working as hard to find their killers as they are untangling Alex Murdaugh\u2019s finances.Murdaugh is the fourth generation of a prominent legal family in tiny Hampton County. His great-grandfather, grandfather and father were all elected prosecutors and his family helped run the biggest law firm in the county for a century.Friday\u2019s indictments include charges for Murdaugh\u2019s handling of the aftermath of a wreck that caused a deaf man to end up quadriplegic.ADVERTISEMENTMurdaugh took a $309,000 check he was supposed to give to Hakeem Pinckney\u2019s family and instead bought money orders that went to cover money he took from the accounts of other clients, to pay down a loan and get cash for himself and an unnamed family member, according to the indictment.Then when Pinckney died in a nursing home from the lingering effects of his injuries, Murdaugh got an additional $89,000 settlement on Pinckney\u2019s behalf, but deposited that check in his account without ever telling the man\u2019s family, prosecutors said.The lawyer for the Pinckney family said the transactions are complex and hard to follow and even more money may have been stolen.

Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Puppy Bowl | AP ...", "date": "2022-02-07T14:31:00Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "Here\u2019s a collection curated by The Associated Press\u2019 entertainment journalists of what\u2019s arriving on TV, streaming services and music platforms this week.MOVIES\u2014 Valentine\u2019s Day means romantic comedies, and romantic comedies \u2014 often enough \u2014 mean Jennifer Lopez. The rom-com mainstay of \u201cMaid in Manhattan\u201d and \u201cThe Wedding Planner\u201d returns to the genre in \u201cMarry Me,\u201d  which opens Friday in theaters and on Peacock. In it, she plays a J-Lo-like pop star who learns her fianc\u00e9 has been cheating on her just before their wedding is to be televised. Heartbroken and distraught, she pulls a random fan (Owen Wilson) out of the audience who happens to be holding a \u201cMarry Me\u201d sign. The movie, which Lopez produced and performs songs in, will surely strike some as reflecting the star\u2019s own closely followed, always-in-the-spotlight romantic life. It\u2019s also her first lead role in a movie since 2019\u2032s acclaimed \u201cHustlers.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT\u2014 Amazon Studios, too, has its own prominent rom-com offering, starring Charlie Day and Jenny Slate. In \u201cI Want You Back,\u201d they play a pair of dumped 30-somethings stewing over their breakups. The two friends conspire to ruin their ex\u2019s new relationships to win them back. The film, which debuts Friday on Amazon Prime Video, is directed by Jason Orley, who helmed the charming 2019 Pete Davidson film \u201cBig Time Adolescence.\u201d Davidson also makes an appearance in \u201cI Want You Back.\u201d EntertainmentSpotify CEO says canceling Joe Rogan isn't 'the answer'Scarlett Johansson, Colin Jost reunite for Super Bowl adGun salutes mark Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee yearNew this week: Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Puppy Bowl\u2014 The never-quenched thirst for streaming content is well suited to Steven Soderbergh, a protean filmmaker who churns out compelling movies at a blistering speed. \u201cKIMI,\u201d which debuts Thursday on HBO Max, is his third movie for the streamer in just over a year. First was \u201cLet Them All Talk,\u201d a nifty little movie shot largely while crossing the Atlantic on the Queen Mary 2. Last summer, came the engrossing Detroit crime drama \u201cNo Sudden Move.\u201d \u201cKIMI,\u201d scripted by David Koepp (\u201cJurassic Park\u201d), stars Zo\u00eb Kravitz as an agoraphobic voice stream interpreter who believes she overheard a murder on a recording she\u2019s analyzing. \u2014 AP Film Writer Jake Coyle MUSIC \u2014 Mary J. Blige may have just said goodbye to viewers in the season finale of her Starz series \u201cPower Book II: Ghost\u201d but she\u2019s not going away: Blige pops up in a big way this week with a new album out Friday and a spot in the Super Bowl halftime show. The 13-track album, called \u201cGood Morning Gorgeous,\u201d features Anderson .Paak, Usher, DJ Khaled, Dave East and Fivio Foreign. The title track is an affirmation: \u201cSometimes you gotta look in the mirror and say/\u2018Good morning gorgeous\u2019/No one else can make me feel this way.\u201d\u2014 Spoon roar back with the 10-track, stripped-down rock \u2018n\u2019 roll album \u201cLucifer on the Sofa\u201d out Friday. It marks the quintet\u2019s first set of songs recorded in its hometown of Austin, Texas, in more than a decade, kicked off by the single \u201cWild.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to make a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record, a great rock \u2018n\u2019 roll record. I just don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s enough great rock \u2018n\u2019 roll records being made these days,\u201d frontman Britt Daniel recently told The AP. He also revealed that the title song refers to himself, saying that\u2019s \u201cthe character that I can become when I\u2019m at my worst.\u201d \u2014 AP Entertainment Writer Mark KennedyADVERTISEMENTTELEVISION\u2014 Joseph Sikora\u2019s Tommy Egan is at the center of \u201cPower Book IV: Force,\u201d as is Chicago. It\u2019s where Tommy ends up after ditching the familiar turf of New York, and executive producer Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d Jackson says the Windy City is both a character and a means of approaching the third \u201cPower Book\u201d spinoff with a clean slate and new tone. For Tommy, what was intended as a quick stop ends up plunging him into the city\u2019s drug game and scheming to become its kingpin. Isaac Keys, Lili Simmons, Gabrielle Ryan and Shane Harper are among the cast members in the drama now on Starz.\u2014 Gugu Mbatha-Raw and David Oyelowo star in HBO Max\u2019s \u201cThe Girl Before,\u201d adapted from novelist JP Delaney\u2019s best-selling psychological thriller of the same name. Mbatha-Raw\u2019s Jane is delighted to move into an impressively sleek, modern house, the work of an architect (Oyelowo) who requires occupants to follow his demanding rules. When Jane begins to discover parallels between her experience and that of previous tenant Emma (Jessica Plummer), the posh digs start to look far less appealing. The drama\u2019s four episodes are out Thursday.\u2014 All together now: Awww, Puppy Bowl is back! The event rides the coattails of that other, puppy-less bowl game and for the good cause of showcasing animal shelters, their dedicated staffers and the furry residents in need of homes. When Team Ruff and Team Fluff and coaches Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg meet in \u201cPuppy Bowl XVIII,\u201d more pups will take the field than ever before. The three-hour event, on discovery+ and Animal Planet at 2 p.m. EST Sunday features 118 adoptable players from 33 states. Among them: Benny, a wheelchair-using Labradoodle, and Pongo, a deaf Dalmatian. \u2014 AP Television Writer Lynn Elber___Catch up on AP\u2019s entertainment coverage here: https://apnews.com/apf-entertainment."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-bloomington-lafayette-0fb3458e3893455679974bed3db7d2ca", "headline": "Saturday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2022-02-06T04:14:26Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "GIRLS PREP BASKETBALL=Sectionals=First Round=Class 4A=7.

Will Smith, Lady Gaga and Ben Affleck landed individual nominations for the 28th Screen Actors Guild Awards on Wednesday, while the casts of \u201cBelfast\u201d and \u201cCODA\u201d were among those nominated for the guild\u2019s top award, best ensemble. The nominees were announced Wednesday by actors Vanessa Hudgens and Rosario Dawson on Instagram Live. While the nominations were conducted virtually due to the surge in COVID-19 cases, the streamed announcement still represented one of the most meaningful mornings in an awards season largely snuffed out by the pandemic. Joining Kenneth Branagh\u2019s semi-autobiographical \u201cBelfast\u201d and the coming-of-age drama \u201cCODA\u201d for best ensemble were the casts for Ridley Scott\u2019s true-tale, high-camp \u201cHouse of Gucci,\u201d Adam McKay\u2019s apocalypse comedy \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d and the family tennis drama \u201cKing Richard.\u201d Notably left out were the casts of Steven Spielberg\u2019s lavish \u201cWest Side Story\u201d revival (which landed a supporting nod for Ariana DeBose) and Jane Campion\u2019s \u201cThe Power of the Dog.\u201d Campion\u2019s gothic drama, though, landed individual SAG nominations for Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst and Kodi Smit-McPhee. ADVERTISEMENTThe SAG Awards have more of the awards season spotlight this year since the Golden Globes \u2014 usually the kickoff party to final Oscar stretch \u2014 made barely a peep. The Globes were unceremoniously announced Sunday on Twitter in a private ceremony due to Hollywood\u2019s boycott of the beleaguered Hollywood Foreign Press Association over diversity and ethical issues. The omicron surge also prompted the Critics Choice Awards to postpone its Jan. 9 in-person gala. For the second straight year, Oscar season has gone virtual \u2014 and struggled to make much noise. But the SAG nominations suggest that plenty of famous faces are in the hunt this year. Along with Will Smith (\u201cKing Richard\u201d) and Cumberbatch, the nominees for best male lead actor are: Denzel Washington (\u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth\u201d), Andrew Garfield (\u201cTick, Tick ... Boom!\u201d) and Javier Bardem (\u201cBeing the Ricardos\u201d). Up for best female lead are: Lady Gaga (\u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d), Jessica Chastain (\u201cThe Eyes of Tammy Faye\u201d), Olivia Colman (\u201cThe Lost Daughter\u201d), Nicole Kidman (\u201cBeing the Ricardos\u201d) and Jennifer Hudson (\u201cRespect\u201d). Joining Dunst and DeBose in the best female supporting category are Caitriona Balfe (\u201cBelfast\u201d), Cate Blanchett (\u201cNightmare Alley\u201d) and Ruth Negga (\u201cPassing\u201d). The best male supporting nominees are: Affleck (\u201cThe Tender Bar\u201d), Bradley Cooper (\u201cLicorice Pizza\u201d), Troy Kotsur (\u201cCODA\u201d), Jared Leto (\u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d) and Smit-McPhee.Kotsur is the first deaf actor to land an individual SAG nomination. The SAG Awards, presented by the actors guild SAG-AFTRA, are among the most reliable Oscar bellwethers. Seldom does a movie or performance not nominated by the screen actors end up winning at the Academy Awards. Actors make up the biggest percentage of the film academy, so their choices have the largest sway.But last year, SAG and the academy diverged more than usual. Only one of its acting winners \u2014 Daniel Kaluuya (\u201cJudas and the Black Messiah\u201d) \u2014 repeated at the Oscars. (The other SAG winners were Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis in \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom,\u201d and Yuh-Jung Youn in \u201cMinari.\u201d) The Aaron Sorkin courtroom drama \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7\u201d won best ensemble at a virtual SAG Awards  while Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s \u201cNomadland\u201d \u2014 which included many nonprofessional actors and went unnominated for SAG\u2019s ensemble award \u2014 triumphed at the Oscars. That history will give hope to supporters of Kristen Stewart (\u201cSpencer\u201d), maybe the most notable performer overlooked Wednesday. Others that missed out include Peter Dinklage (\u201cCyrano\u201d), Ciar\u00e1n Hinds (\u201cBelfast\u201d) and Rachel Zegler (\u201cWest Side Story\u201d). While some have rooted for some of the year\u2019s most popular blockbusters to give the flagging Oscars a populist jolt, \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home,\u201d \u201cDune\u201d and \u201cNo Time To Die\u201d received no major nominations from the actors guild. \u201cDune\u201d and \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d did, though, join \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix Resurrections\u201d and \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\u201d in the stunt ensemble category. Yet possibly the most popular TV series of 2021 did haul in plenty of recognition. Netflix\u2019s much-watched \u201cSquid Game\u201d was nominated for four SAG awards including best drama series. Series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk on Wednesday recalled watching the hoopla at awards ceremonies held at the Shrine Auditorium across the street from the University of Southern California when he was studying there. \u201cAt the time, I told myself I\u2019d like to feature my work at American film awards one day,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNow, I think back to those memories.\u201dThe series\u2019 star Lee Jung-jae said he felt an \u201celectrical shock\u201d when his name was announced among the nominees. A veteran of Korean TV and film, he\u2019s laughed off U.S. media questions about overnight success. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I\u2019m now a newbie actor!\u201d he said Wednesday, clutching a bottle of wine.The television nominations were also led by HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d (four nods including best drama series and best actor for Jeremy Strong and Brian Cox); \u201cTed Lasso\u201d (five nods including best comedy series); and \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d (four nods including best drama series).

The Georgia Department of Education hired a new superintendent last month at the Atlanta Area School for the Deaf in Clarkston, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The school\u2019s former superintendent, who is deaf, left in June for another job.The new superintendent is white, and some former employees say Black employees were overlooked for promotion, according to the report.Students at the school held protests last week, before COVID-19 led to a two-week closure. News outlets for the deaf reported students were concerned about audism \u2014 discrimination against and dismissive attitudes toward deaf people. They also raised concerns about discrimination against people of color.ADVERTISEMENTA state education department spokeswoman said the agency \u201cstands opposed to audism and other forms of prejudice\u201d and wants to meet with students.The school\u2019s top leadership includes no people of color or deaf people. The superintendent and one of two assistant principals are white women who can hear, the agency said. Another assistant principal position is unfilled.Black students make up the largest proportion of enrollment, followed by Hispanic students.State officials confirmed 12 employees have quit the school. Terynce Butts is one of them. Butts, who can hear and is Black, told the Journal-Constitution that several Black employees, both hearing and deaf, were among those who quit because they thought the hiring process did not respect diversity.\u201cI\u2019m concerned with equity and inclusion for everyone. Racism is a concern, yes, but also audism and homophobia,\u201d Butts wrote.He said a Black, deaf woman applied to be superintendent and left the school after she didn\u2019t get an interview.The state says it hired the best person for the job \u201cbased on a full vetting process including review of applications, interviews, and reference checks.\u201dThe former superintendent, John Serrano, is now an administrator at Gallaudet University, a private school for the deaf in Washington. He declined to be interviewed, saying in an email that his \u201cheart goes out to the students and teachers/staff affected by the turn of events following my departure.\u201dTawny Holmes Hlibok, a deaf professor of deaf studies at Gallaudet, said Georgia set a precedent of deaf leadership by hiring Serrano but rolled back that progress by replacing him with someone who is not deaf.\u201cIf a deaf student goes to a deaf school and they see the leader as a hearing person they\u2019re going to say, \u2018You know, that means that I can\u2019t be a leader,\u2019\u201d Holmes Hlibok said.The longtime leader of the Georgia School for the Deaf in Cave Spring also is not deaf.Nationally, deaf leaders of deaf schools remain in the minority but their numbers are growing, Holmes Hlibok said. She said Louisiana recently hired its first deaf and Black leader for a school for the deaf and a Tennessee school has a leader raised by deaf parents."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/marvel-eternals-deaf-superhero-lauren-ridloff-81089ca2df4ae2d38ff205820b6b6c99", "headline": "Lauren Ridloff on playing the MCU's first deaf superhero | AP News", "date": "2021-11-03T19:48:00Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Three years ago, Lauren Ridloff gave an interview that concluded with the actor contemplating what she wanted to do next.

Ridloff hadn\u2019t set out to necessarily be an actor. She initially was just helping \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d director Kenny Leon as a sign language tutor. Still, at that moment, Ridloff set her sights high. Talking to The New York Times in May 2018, she said she\u2019d like to play a superhero. ADVERTISEMENTTo Ridloff\u2019s surprise, the wish came true. In Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s \u201cEternals,\u201d Ridloff plays the first deaf superhero in Marvel\u2019s \u201ccinematic universe.\u201d In the film, which Disney releases in theaters Friday, Ridloff plays one of 10 immortal guardians alongside Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie and Kumail Nanjiani. \u201cIt was a manifestation,\u201d Ridloff says, laughing. \u201cAt that time, I still wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to continue in acting. I was honestly terrified. I had given up a career as a teacher and I went to try acting, but then my Broadway show was ending. What\u2019s next? Do I even bet on auditioning? I didn\u2019t think Hollywood was ready for a deaf actor at the time, let alone a deaf superhero.\u201d&quot;My two boys get to see a deaf superhero who just happens to be their mom too.&quot; #Eternals star Lauren Ridloff shares the importance of representation on screen. pic.twitter.com/jYnBQZ9Z1X&mdash; AP Entertainment (@APEntertainment) November 4, 2021\u201cEternals,\u201d in which the age-old superheroes have long secretly lived among humans but are now roused to prevent a cosmic apocalypse, seeks to expand many of the traditional notions. For the first time in 26 blockbuster films, a person with hearing impairment is alongside other mighty saviors fighting to rescue the world. \u201cIn the beginning, I admit I was terrified,\u201d Ridloff said in a recent interview by Zoom from Los Angeles through an American Sign Language translator. \u201cIt was almost like I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I was so overwhelmed with the responsibility of being the first and only deaf superhero. How do I even start to represent people and a community?\u201dRidloff, though, had an epiphany while jogging, a hobby she considers a form of meditation. It was a fitting place to find clarity: In the film, her character Makkari has super speed, one of several traits of a character \u2014 a beefy white guy in the comics \u2014 that\u2019s party drawn from Ridloff\u2019s own characteristics. ADVERTISEMENT\u201cI realized when I started talking about me and when I started using pronouns like \u2018I\u2019 rather than \u2018we,\u2019 that\u2019s how I can be my most authentic self. I can tell my own story, and I can allow people to decide if they identify and relate to me,\u201d Ridloff says. \u201cWith that understanding, I feel so much more comfortable in my role.\u201dThe 43-year-old Ridloff, who has been deaf since birth, had been primarily raising her two boys with husband Douglas Ridloff when her work with Leon led to a impromptu table read on \u201cChildren of a Lesser God.\u201d Since then, Ridloff has had a recurring role on \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and poignantly played a teacher in last year\u2019s \u201cSound of Metal.\u201d \u201cWorking as a kindergarten teacher, let me tell you, they are a tough audience,\u201d says Ridloff. \u201cI had to be engaging. I had to tell these beautiful stories. That\u2019s the only way that you keep them engaged. I think that\u2019s where I developed my acting powers.\u201dRidloff caught the attention of \u201cEternals\u201d casting director Sarah Finn, who was looking for a wide spectrum of performers for the film. When Ridloff was brought in for a meeting with Zhao and producer Nate Moore, she didn\u2019t know what movie or role she was being considered for. She figured, she says, \u201cmaybe I would be some woman in distress, some sort of victim, maybe they wanted me for \u2018Black Panther.\u2019\u201dMeeting in Los Angeles, Zhao had an immediate response to Ridloff, who never officially auditioned. \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy in her, and she\u2019s very proud of who she is,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cShe\u2019s very mischievous in real life. She\u2019s got a twinkle in her eye and she flirts with the camera. She\u2019s got a presence. When she first met (\u2018Eternals\u2019 co-star) Barry (Keoghan), there was such a beautiful thing going on that I had to incorporate it into the characters.\u201d Ridloff\u2019s casting is one of several MCU landmark moments in \u201cEternals.\u201d The film also, in Chan, features the films\u2019 first Asian American woman protagonist, the first gay kiss and, perhaps the biggest shock of all in a brief PG-13 scene, the first superhero sex.\u201cI do feel like we\u2019re entering the revisionist period for this genre,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cIt\u2019s about time because it\u2019s been a couple decades now. The desire comes from both the viewers and the makers and the studios. Let\u2019s challenge some of those fundamental ideas this genre was born out of.\u201dRidloff notes that she soon won\u2019t be the only deaf superhero in the MCU. Another will be featured in the upcoming Disney+ series \u201cHawkeye.\u201d In the comics, Jeremy Renner\u2019s character has often been rendered as deaf. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the only deaf superhero in the MCU,\u201d says Ridloff. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have another one joining very shortly, which I\u2019m thrilled about.\u201dBut in even the lengthy star-studded \u201cEternals,\u201d Ridloff stands out as one of the performers you most want to see more of after the credits have rolled. As played by Ridloff, Makkari\u2019s deafness isn\u2019t just a limitation but a gain that makes her stronger. In one tragic scene, Ridloff also lets out an anguished cry that reverberates with something more raw and genuine than is often heard in the bombast of superhero films. It\u2019s a meaningful moment for Ridloff who stopped using her speech from the age of 13 until it was necessary performing in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d because she felt people were equating her intonation with her intelligence. \u201cThat scream wasn\u2019t included in the script at all. I just dove into the moment and I made the decision to scream,\u201d says Ridloff. \u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time that that shot was going to make it into the film. I was surprised to see it there. At the premiere, my dad had gone to see the movie with me, he was like, \u2018That was a scream!\u2019 He was shocked.\u201dBut one question remains for Ridloff. Now that she\u2019s a superhero, what would she like to do next?\u201cI would love to be a part of something that is similar to \u2018Bridgerton,\u2019 something that\u2019s a period piece film because, really, you don\u2019t see that many deaf people in period pieces,\u201d says Ridloff. She smiles. \u201cSo I\u2019m putting that out there.\u201d___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/2020-tokyo-olympics-volleyball-deaf-player-role-model-cf61ead7eb790a4ba77557327522b6f7", "headline": "US volleyball star revels as role model for deaf kids | AP News", "date": "2021-07-28T15:37:00Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Growing up nearly completely deaf provided a challenge for David Smith as he tried to integrate with other kids at school or on the playground.Whatever Smith may have lacked in hearing was more than made up with empathy, compassion and most of all athletic ability.Smith was born nearly deaf with 80-90% hearing loss but has managed to overcome that to become an elite athlete competing in his third Olympics for the U.S. men\u2019s volleyball team.\u201cSports were definitely a confidence booster for me,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt was something I thrived at despite having quote unquote a disadvantage. I think for me personally, that was great for my mental understanding of who I am and what I can do, but I think it was also a unique way of me integrating myself with the normal hearing world.\u201dWhile Smith may struggle to have normal conversations as he relies on hearing aids and lip reading to communicate, he never had any limitations when it came to sports.ADVERTISEMENTThe boy who wanted a ball of some kind as a gift at nearly every birthday and holiday was a star athlete at an early age before starting to focus on volleyball as he got to high school.\u201cAs a kid, if you can show that you go out and you can play with other kids, do exactly what they can do, passing the ball and scoring goals or whatever else, they understand that maybe this kid is maybe limited one area of life, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t do everything else that we can do,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think that was a huge way for me to become more socially involved. Sports was my way in.\u201dSmith thanks his parents, Nancy and Rick, for that opportunity as they made the decision when he was young to put him in public schools and sports teams instead of keeping him with deaf kids.Nancy Smith had worked with deaf kids for a few years before David was born so she was well prepared for how to raise him.\u201cI home-schooled him for a couple of years because I wasn\u2019t sure what his language would be, how his reading and all that would be,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to make sure he had a good foundation. He just did so we put him into public school and there you go.\u201dSmith appreciates the choice his parents made and how they advocated for him along the way whether it was with coaches, teachers or referees, who sometimes questioned why he wore hearing aids.\u201cThey didn\u2019t hold me back,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat was one of the life lessons that I took from my parents. I\u2019m the only one that can hold me back from doing what I want to do. If I want to do something there is a way to do it whether it\u2019s sports or a job or university or a relationship. I might have to take a different route. I might have to make some adjustments along the way. But if I truly have a passion for it, I truly have a calling to do it, it\u2019s on my shoulders to be able to find a way to make it happen.\u201dADVERTISEMENTThe 36-year-old Smith eventually earned a scholarship to play volleyball at UC Irvine, joined the national team in 2009 and made his first of three Olympic teams in 2012. He won a bronze medal in 2016 and is seeking to do even better this year.He has also played professionally across Europe and has been an inspiration to deaf kids wherever he goes.In college road games, there were deaf cheering sections for him in Hawaii and kids would give Nancy and Rick Smith leis.Now he hears from parents and kids on social media or wherever he plays. Smith said he was particularly touched by one young deaf fan when he played in Poland, who came to all his matches and wore Smith\u2019s jersey.Smith said the kid was weeping when he changed teams, but he still keeps in touch with the mother through social media.\u201cI think sometimes so many people see hearing loss as a disability and that\u2019s all they see and that becomes the center of their thought process,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019re thinking about what you can\u2019t do instead of what you can do. Being able to demonstrate that is one of the most rewarding things. Being able to be a real time influence in a real time inspiration to the next generation has been real cool.\u201dSmith is a starter on a U.S. team that improved to 2-1 at the Olympics by beating Tunisia in four sets on Wednesday.In other matches, Canada beat Iran 3-0, Argentina edged France 3-2, Poland topped Venezuela 3-1, Italy beat Japan 3-1 and the Russians knocked off Brazil 3-0.___More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2020-tokyo-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/new-york-academy-awards-sundance-film-festival-movies-sian-heder-cd26521d96203efd011b9d9cef2e7fc7", "headline": "'CODA' has loud message even when there's silence | AP News", "date": "2021-02-04T16:12:09Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "New York (AP) \u2014 The breakout hit of this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival is set to expand the conversation about diversity in Hollywood. \u201cCODA,\u201d which stands for \u201cChild of Deaf Adults,\u201d invites viewers into a world many have never seen, with a silence they\u2019ve never experienced. It depicts the life of a mostly deaf family whose love, friction, drama and laughter is the same as any other family, but communicated through sign language. The movie, a remake of the award-winning 2014 French film \u201cLa Famille B\u00e9lier,\u201d won the festival\u2019s top audience and grand jury awards and set a Sundance record by selling to Apple for $25 million. ADVERTISEMENTWritten and directed by Sian Heder, it was shot in Gloucester, Massachusetts, during the summer of 2019. The movie follows Ruby, the only hearing person in her New England family, as she contemplates leaving their struggling fishing business \u2014 and her role as their interpreter \u2014 to pursue her own dreams at the Berklee College of Music. The family is forced to figure out how they\u2019ll survive without her. Deaf actors Troy Kotsur, Daniel Durant and Marlee Matlin \u2014 the only deaf actor to win an Oscar \u2014 play Ruby\u2019s family. Emilia Jones stars as Ruby.Jones wasn\u2019t an obvious choice to play the role of Ruby, which demanded singing and knowledge of American Sign Language. The 18-year-old British actor had no formal training in either.\u201cI remember thinking whoever is lucky enough to be able to play Ruby is a very, very, very lucky girl because it\u2019s not very often that you have so many skills that you can learn for a film. I had to learn sign language. I\u2019ve never had a singing lesson before we started,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I love, I love, I love a challenge and I love a film that will educate me and make me grow as a person.\u201dThe film highlights the humanity of those with disabilities while dispelling myths, showing in one instance how deaf people experience music. Ruby and her brother tease and sign profane insults at each other, while their parents\u2019 extremely active sex life plays out in awkward, hysterical situations. \u201cThe first thing that came to mind is my daughter, who is a real-life CODA. And when I read it over, that gave me some flashbacks based on my experience in this world,\u201d said Kotsur, recalling first reading the script. \u201cIt\u2019s a good experience for the audience to come into deaf culture and get an inside view of what it looks like.\u201dDuring filming, two ASL experts reviewed the script, helped Heder interpret the scenes and relay messages to the cast. They also made adjustments if scenes were not true to deaf culture. Subtitles are used when family members are communicating with each other, but only Ruby\u2019s translations are heard when they speak with hearing people.ADVERTISEMENTMatlin, who won the best actress Academy Award in 1987 for \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d says \u201cCODA\u201d is \u201cthe full package\u201d in portraying the deaf community on screen.\u201cNo offense to the other projects that I\u2019ve been involved in where there were deaf characters in them, (but) I found that since \u2018Children of a Lesser God,\u2019 there wasn\u2019t really a profound exploration of characters being deaf, whether they were authentically deaf or the story was about being deaf or love in the deaf and hearing communities,\u201d she said. \u201cFor people who have never seen deaf people or have never even seen sign language and they think that the we\u2019re all the same, that we live the same way, that we come from the same mind-set, we are not,\u201d said Matlin. \u201cWe are as varied as people who can hear, and this is one facet of the deaf community.\u201dHeder and the actors say they hope \u201cCODA\u201d challenges Hollywood. Although diversity has been a hot topic in recent years, discussions are generally centered only around race and gender. Heder, who began learning ASL a year before filming, says the industry should shift from its tendency to cast non-disabled actors as characters with disabilities.\u201cWhen we started casting \u2026 I think everyone needed to be educated. I remember people saying, \u2018Well, are there deaf actors out there?\u2019 And there are a world of deaf actors out there,\u201d she said. \u201cTroy is incredibly talented and he won this part, but there were other amazing actors that came in and auditioned for that role. And I would say that about every role across the board.\u201dAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 U.S. adults \u2014 approximately 61 million people \u2014 has a disability that impacts major life activities. A 2017 study from the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism found that just 2.7% of characters in the 100 highest-earning movies in 2016 were disabled, revealing the huge chasm between the population and what\u2019s on screens.There have been advances in recent years. Zack Gottsagen, an actor with Down syndrome, won acclaim starring in 2019\u2019s \u201cThe Peanut Butter Falcon\u201d alongside Shia LaBeouf. Deaf actor Lauren Ridloff will portray Marvel\u2019s first deaf superhero in Chloe Zhao\u2019s \u201cThe Eternals,\u201d set for release in November. Last week, NBCUniversal announced that it will commit to auditioning actors with disabilities for each new studio production in hopes to increase disability representation on screen.Heder hopes the entertainment industry expands its thinking when it comes to casting. \u201c(Filmmakers) have a role in their script that says \u2018open ethnicity,\u2019 but they don\u2019t think to add that this could be open to someone with a disability or you could cast a deaf person in that role,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more awareness people have, in writers\u2019 rooms, directors, creators (will) start to open up their minds and understand that inclusion really means other things.\u201d___Follow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at twitter.com/GaryGHamilton "}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/business-technology-oregon-lawsuits-software-585335b700a983e01d8d0d8878eb8f6b", "headline": "Lawsuit: Software company refused to hire man who is deaf | AP News", "date": "2021-09-29T22:47:33Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "PORTLAND, Ore.

(AP) \u2014 Unable to see, Carla McQuillan typically uses a program that converts the letters on a screen into audible words when she wants to read something online. The tool wouldn\u2019t work when she tried to schedule an appointment to get a COVID-19 vaccine, however.\u201cWhen I clicked, it wouldn\u2019t tell me what the date was. I could have tapped on something, but I wouldn\u2019t have known what it was,\u201d said McQuillan, who operates a Montessori school and serves as president of the National Federation of the Blind of Oregon. Her husband, who can see, eventually helped out.In Alabama, Donte Little helped 20 blind and deaf people who had trouble signing up for vaccinations and getting to a clinic for shots. ADVERTISEMENT\u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge for anybody. Add deafness or blindness on top of it and it\u2019s that much more of one,\u201d said Little, who is visually impaired and directs a regional center for the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind.The confusing maze of websites, phone numbers, emails and paper documents required to sign up for an immunization in the United States is presenting a challenge for people who are visually impaired or hard of hearing. Providers are using multiple different systems that can vary by state and even cities, they say, often forcing the disabled to rely on others to help them get in line.Federal laws require communications in an understandable format and accommodations to assist people who might face obstacles, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has laid out instructions that include having local health departments provide staff to address accessibility needs and plans.But the National Federation of the Blind wrote to every U.S. governor last month complaining about hurdles posed by balky sign-up systems and vaccine distribution methods including drive-up clinics, which it said are largely inaccessible to people who can\u2019t see. The group has yet to receive a \u201csubstantive\u201d response from any state, spokesman Chris Danielsen said.Separately, the National Association of the Deaf said problems including confusing and complex information, phone systems that can\u2019t be used by hard of hearing and a lack of interpreters is making it difficult for people who can\u2019t hear to make appointments for immunizations. Chief Executive Howard A. Rosenblum said the group has asked the Biden administration for help.\u201cThe process continues to be very haphazard and confusing for everyone, but particularly for people with disabilities due to the lack of foresight on accessibility,\u201d he said in an email.ADVERTISEMENTSuch problems could affect millions. The CDC reports that an estimated 12 million Americans over the age of 40 have impaired vision, including 1 million who are blind, and the National Association of the Deaf said a 2011 study found that 48 million Americans are deaf or hard of hearing. The National Consortium on Deaf-Blindness estimated in 2008 that about 40,000 U.S. adults were both deaf and blind.Tara L. Invidiato, a director with the American Association of the DeafBlind, said members trying to sign up for vaccines have faced multiple problems including glitchy websites, inaccessible notifications and the speed required to fill out forms while reading Braille. \u201cI had to rely on someone who can see and that is unsettling because we the DeafBlind aim for independent living and we know we can do things by ourselves for the most part,\u201d she said in an email interview.Robert Weinstock, who is profoundly deaf, said clunky telephone systems are posing problems for some who can\u2019t hear because some appointment hotlines don\u2019t have workers who understand how to use video services that allow for communication by sign language. That leads to frustration and calls that end with hang-ups, he said.\u201cAlso, some sites will accept pre-registration online, but conduct the actual scheduling via telephone, leaving voice messages even when the deaf person has explicitly requested contact via text or email. This can be a significant barrier,\u201d said Weinstock, director of public relations at Gallaudet University, a school for the deaf.Alicia Wooten, who works with a COVID-19 team at Gallaudet, which is in Washington, D.C., said simply getting the word out to deaf people about vaccination availability is a problem because so much notification is done by platforms including radio.\u201cThis means the Deaf community has a delay in getting information, so that by the time they try to register, vaccines are already reserved. The cycle is then repeated,\u201d she said an an email.But there are cases where the system is working. Weinstock said both he and his wife went to vaccination locations and got shots with relative ease because there were interpreters and people had been trained.\u201cEvery single person I spoke with, from check-in to \u2018recovery,\u2019 whipped out their smartphones and used a notes app to converse with me, or wrote on paper, or otherwise made sure I was fully included,\u201d Weinstock, who lives in Maryland, said in an email exchange.Robert Jaquiss, who is blind, experienced problems firsthand when he tried to get an appointment for a shot in Missoula, Montana. He was eventually able to snag a time with the help of a friend who can see, but Jaquiss said the sign-up system isn\u2019t built to accommodate people unable to navigate quickly during the process.\u201cI can\u2019t just zip-zip through,\u201d Jaquiss, 67, said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen they say a site link opens up at 1 p.m., they mean 1 p.m., and if you\u2019re not Johnny on the spot the appointments are gone.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/health-dogs-education-science-812bc702cc4088a0a62059d3b34660d9", "headline": "Deaf dog finds empathy in deaf-education teacher's home | AP News", "date": "2021-07-10T12:44:31Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "1 of 6Annah Hill and her dog Flynn at their home in Indiana, Pa.

(AP) \u2014 He was an incorrigible cur.This mutt puppy wouldn\u2019t listen to anything he was told.Three families tried.Three families brought him back to the Four Footed Friends shelter, each time with worse habits than before.When he went up for adoption again in late 2016, he had a penchant for chewing apart anything that was stuffed \u2014 toys, cushions, and the like. He had a name, too \u2014 Flynn. And he had a diagnosis. He was deaf.o o oThe Hill family\u2019s faithful little guy Wyatt suddenly up and died that year.Their furry companion, a 10-year-old Husky mix, gave no clues. He was faithful as could be, and had made a habit of cuddling with Annah Hill, who had been having a few down days of her own.A checkup after Wyatt passed revealed stunning news. He was riddled with cancer. But he had never, well, whined about it.\u201cHe was always comforting me,\u201d Annah said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine an animal not feeling well himself, yet giving you that devotion.\u201dSoon, Annah and Greg Hill and their daughters, Jeanice, Leannah and Brooke, and their fat orange cat Mr. PIB were ready to replace Wyatt in their home.ADVERTISEMENTo o oA sign on Flynn\u2019s cage at the shelter warned that he would tear up stuffed items.He was a bundle of energy and the Hills were ready to harness him.He ran circles through the kitchen, dining room and living room of the family\u2019s ranch style house along Carter Avenue in Indiana, bouncing off the furniture, his first day in the house.\u201cHe was like a ping-pong ball!\u201d Annah said. It\u2019s been suggested that he\u2019s a mix of beagle and rat terrier. A \u201craggle,\u201d with the signature traits. High-spirited, high-strung, hyper.From the start Flynn was affectionate, too. He reciprocates every scratch and belly rub with dog kisses.One day Flynn greeted Annah full force, somewhat painfully as he leaped toward her chest and shoulders.Double checking for a bruise, Annah found worse. A lump that had eluded her detection in her breast. Doctors said she had stage three breast cancer.\u201cIf he had not been all crazy and ran up and hit me, I never would have found that lump fast enough,\u201d she said. \u201cFlynn helped me find the cancer.\u201dThe cancer, she figured, was the unexplained reason she hadn\u2019t been feeling well all those months. She believes it was the illness that Wyatt had intuitively responded to with his comforting cuddles in his final months.Mastectomy and a rugged course of chemotherapy followed. Medications will always be part of life. The risk of flare-ups is there, too.\u201cFlynn saved my life.\u201do o oHow the deaf dog, Flynn, came into the Hill family was kind of a destiny that the girls made true. It was a month after they lost Wyatt.Leannah and Jeanice found his listing on Four Footed Friends website.\u201cThey said \u2019Mom, there\u2019s a dog and he\u2019s deaf! We have to check him out!\u201d Annah said.ADVERTISEMENTIt was natural. Leannah and Jeanice practice American Sign Language. Brooke took it up, too. They communicate with their mom that way.Annah Hill \u2014 Dr. Hill, that is \u2014 is an associate professor in the Department of Communication Disorders at Indiana University of Pennsylvania and is Program Director for Disability Services, where teaching sign language is her thing.But wait.It was out of necessity. Hill has neared deafness herself since 2005, when she was first diagnosed with loss of hearing in her right ear. She was studying that year for her master\u2019s degree in deaf education at the University of Pittsburgh.How many planets could possibly align like this?In a household of sign-language users, establishing communication with Flynn was an immediate goal.Someone at Four Footed Friends had tried to train him in the hand signals that dolphins follow in water parks. He didn\u2019t grasp it.But Annah, Greg and their daughters developed a set of commands fundamental to any well-trained dog and coupled the signals with universal facial expressions and a system of rewards to bring Flynn to understanding.A thumbs-up, like the world over, is his sign of affirmation.A collar that vibrates and sometimes shocks has helped Flynn to learn his boundaries.Literally.He has been conditioned to stay in the Hills\u2019 backyard and gets a reminder when he romps too far.Flynn soon mastered \u201csit,\u201d \u201clay,\u201d \u201cplay dead\u201d and \u201croll over\u201d with ease. He retrieves his toys when told, if he wants to play.Annah Hill said her daughters challenged him further.Climbing up and going down the sliding board in the backyard is part of his skill set. He jumps through a hula hoop on cue.Flynn once climbed the ladder to a top bunk bed in the older girls\u2019 room. He enjoys winter sled riding with his humans.That\u2019s a range of performance that has made the Hills a resource for other families with hearing-impaired dogs.\u201cFour Footed Friends will contact us and say \u2018we think we have another animal that is deaf. What did you do with your dog? What do you suggest?\u2019\u201d Annah said. \u201cI love that. I don\u2019t mind. I tell them to let the people who adopt the dog contact me. I can say what I did; I don\u2019t know if it will work, but I\u2019ll let them know.\u201do o oResearch posted at the American Kennel Club (AKC) website reports that 5 to 10 percent of dogs are partially or fully deaf.There are no numbers for deaf dogs for which owners successfully establish communication, but the site gives owners plenty of encouragement.\u201cDeaf dogs can live normal lives but need to have a special dedicated owner. Deaf dogs are not suitable for families with young children as they can be startled easily,\u201d the site offers.Pshaw.Jeanice is 13. Leannah is 12. Brooke is 7, two years older than Flynn. When he was first adopted, Brooke called him \u201clittle brother.\u201do o oLife without sound is natural to Flynn. Overcompensating visually could make it natural for him to pick up on signals and cues from humans. But it\u2019s his advantage over humans that lose hearing well into a life of enjoying all the sounds the world offers.Annah and Greg started their family as her hearing deteriorated.\u201cI had Jeanice in 2007 and the first thing I thought was, \u2018is it progressive and is it going to be so fast that I am not going to hear her speech?\u2019\u201d she pondered. \u201cAnd then I thought, I\u2019m not going to hear Greg\u2019s voice anymore. I had so many things going on in my head because I knew too much from my schooling in deaf education. So that really hit me hard.\u201dAnnah Hill said she and her doctors haven\u2019t pinpointed the cause of her dramatic hearing loss. Acoustic neuroma, scar tissue, use of erythromycin, ototoxicity, environmental factors from her childhood on the Neal family farm in Center Township and genetics are the factors on the table. She said she\u2019s leaning toward genetics because some in her family have developed hearing trouble in recent years.The progression of her hearing loss was slow at first. But in 2013 her \u201cmild to moderate\u201d classification jumped to \u201cmoderate to severe.\u201dHer own education in the subject became her understanding of her condition, how she had to adapt, and how she has empathy for Flynn.Annah Hill said some parts of the sound spectrum are easier for her to hear than others. High frequency sounds are lost. She suspects it\u2019s the same with Flynn, and that he either hears very low frequencies or is sensitive enough to vibrations to recognize things like footsteps.Or a passing motorcycle.A year ago, he tugged and broke the chain that tethered him to a tree in the Hills\u2019 front yard. He ran into the street and bit the tire of a passing motorcycle, Annah said.Flynn was thrown to the side of the road and left in a daze, but suffered nothing worse than a broken tooth and a hard-learned lesson.Much of his days now are spent watching the world go by from the picture window in the living room. The Hills call it Flynn\u2019s TV.o o oThe reason for Flynn\u2019s deafness hasn\u2019t been a major concern.\u201cDeaf dogs can be trained using the same luring and hand signals that dogs with the ability to hear use,\u201d the AKC website advises. \u201cEventually you can begin to rely on hand signals alone. Have fun and be creative! You can use American Sign Language to teach your dog all kinds of words and tricks!\u201dThat\u2019s all second nature now to the Hill family. Call them all trilingual, conversant in English, ASL and doggy signing.Coincidences to some \u2014 Hill\u2019s hearing loss, her professional understanding of deafness, and her family\u2019s adoption of a deaf dog that has outperformed expectations \u2014 are part of a plan with a purpose, Annah is certain.\u201cGod has a reason. He knows,\u201d she said. All the steps pointed toward this. She gave up her dream to attend the highly-touted deaf education program at Bloomsburg University and followed her father Brad Neal\u2019s wishes to attend IUP.Otherwise she would not have met Greg Hill.\u201cI\u2019ve been able to persevere through all these things. My hearing loss. Not going to Bloomsburg. Getting my doctorate. Having children and working at the same time \u2014 again the perseverance and determination,\u201d she said. \u201cThen when I got diagnosed with cancer. I think, in my life, these things have been up to God: \u2018She can handle it.\u2019\u201d___Online:\nhttps://bit.ly/3dYpPgX\n"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/deaf-costco-worker-no-award-7cf5288c062bd23505a314aaa873225e", "headline": "Deaf Costco worker with mumbling manager won't get award | AP ...", "date": "2021-02-24T14:08:16Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

An appellate court also declined to reinstate the award.D\u2019Onofrio had worked for Costco for 24 years, and said she never had issues communicating with managers until one arrived who mumbled, the South Florida SunSentinel reported.ADVERTISEMENTShe requested an interpreter or to have communications written down for her. Instead, Costco provided her with a video phone with online interpretation services. Managers then wrote her up for yelling too loudly into the phone. She sent a letter to the company\u2019s CEO complaining about her treatment.

In January 2019, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 decision found that Costco did provide reasonable accommodation to D\u2019Onofrio and declined to overturn Zloch\u2019s ruling, the newspaper reported. The petition to the Supreme Court asked justices to consider whether the appellate court failed to apply the correct standard of review. Her lawyer, William J.

Anthony had a deaf sister, everyone would know that deaf suffragists fought tirelessly for expanding women\u2019s right to vote, right alongside Anthony herself. Everyone would know deaf suffragists contributed to women\u2019s emancipation in the United States and Britain and that they lived bold lives. ADVERTISEMENTAs a researcher of deaf history, including deaf women\u2019s history, I work to illuminate the often hidden history of deaf people and their unique contributions to the world. I have unearthed historical information about deaf women suffragists and assembled it into an online collection chronicling what is known \u2013 so far \u2013 about these women and their lives.Despite harsh, discriminatory conditions, low pay and lack of recognition, countless deaf women have fought with brilliance and dedication for personal and professional recognition, including for the right to vote.\nUnderpaid and discriminated against\nAnnie Jump Cannon was a pioneering astronomer. Born in 1863, she experienced progressive hearing loss starting at a young age. One of the first women from Delaware to attend college, she was her class valedictorian when she graduated from Wellesley College, where she excelled in the sciences and mathematics.In 1896, she was hired as a \u201cwoman computer\u201d at the Harvard College Observatory, along with another prominent deaf astronomer, Henrietta Swan Leavitt.The work involved looking at photos of stars and calculating their brightness, position and color. The two were paid between 25 and 50 cents an hour \u2013 half the rate paid to men doing similar work. Nevertheless, Cannon is credited with cataloging 350,000 stars. Building on others\u2019 work, Cannon revolutionized and refined a system to rank stars from hottest to coolest that is still used today by the International Astronomical Union, though it is named for Harvard, not for her.ADVERTISEMENTCannon was a member of the National Woman\u2019s Party, formed in 1916 to advocate for passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, allowing women to vote. Cannon\u2019s suffragist efforts used her profession as a launchpad, as when she declared that \u201cif women can organize the sky, we can organize the vote.\u201d She used her prominence to pave the way for women in the sciences, becoming the first woman to receive an honorary degree from Oxford University in 1925, and facing down eugenicists who blocked her from joining the National Academy of Sciences because she was deaf. In 1938, after 40 years of service, her role as \u201cthe dean of women astronomers\u201d finally earned her a permanent faculty position at Harvard, where she worked until her death three years later. A lunar crater, Cannon, and an asteroid, Cannonia, are named for her.\nTwo British women faced prison\nBritish deaf suffragist Helen K. Watts, born in 1881, was a militant member of the radical Women\u2019s Social and Political Union who demonstrated at Parliament in 1909 for the women\u2019s vote. After one protest that year, she was arrested and imprisoned \u2013 but began a 90-hour hunger strike that resulted in her release. As she left, she declared:\u201cThe Suffragettes have come out of the drawing-room, the study and the debating hall, and the committee rooms of Members of Parliament, to appeal to the real sovereign power of the country \u2013 the people.\u201d In 1913, she left the more violent group and joined the nonviolent Women\u2019s Freedom League, also seeking women\u2019s right to vote.One of her sister leaders in the Women\u2019s Freedom League was British deaf suffragist Kate Harvey. Harvey believed in not paying taxes until women were granted the vote \u2013 which resulted in authorities breaking into her home to arrest and imprison her in 1913.\nA silent voice in print\nLaura Redden Searing, born in 1840, was a gifted American poet, newspaper reporter and writer \u2013 often using the male pseudonym Howard Glyndon so her work would be taken more seriously.  Deafened by illness as a child, she entered the Missouri School for the Deaf when she was 15 years old and learned sign language, graduating in 1858, writing an address and \u201cfarewell poem\u201d that was published in the American Annals of the Deaf. When communicating with nonsigners, she wrote with a pencil and pad \u2013 with which she conducted countless interviews over many years as a reporter and writer.In 1860, Searing became the earliest deaf woman journalist, writing for the St. Louis Republican, whose editors sent her to Washington in September 1861. There, she cultivated friendships with prominent leaders and interviewed Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, soldiers on the battlefield, and President Abraham Lincoln. She also met future Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth, and taught him fingerspelling, a manual alphabet that is used in sign language.When the Civil War ended in 1865, she traveled to Europe and picked up reading and writing in French, German, Spanish and Italian. She continued writing news stories for the St. Louis Republican and The New York Times. Returning to the United States in 1870, Searing wrote on a wide variety of topics for the New York Evening Mail and other newspapers and magazines. Searing had a literary circle of admiring friends who supported her work. She also contributed articles and poems to the popular national Silent Worker newspaper, published by the New Jersey School for the Deaf. She was a feminist who wrote about women\u2019s issues such as unequal pay and women\u2019s sexuality. She also explained her support for an 1872 campaign for women\u2019s right to vote with an analogy to the freeing of the slaves after the Civil War:\u201cI believe I am called upon to sign this petition in conformation with that clause of our constitution which recognizes the equal rights of all human beings of lawful age and sound mind without regard to sex, color, or social condition. Having decided that black people do not belong to white ones, why not go a step farther and decide that women do not belong to men unless the proprietorship be recognized as mutual?\u201dIn 1981, Searing was dubbed \u201cthe first deaf women\u2019s libber\u201d by Robert F. Panara, the first deaf professor of Deaf Studies at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, because of her pioneering work in the journalism field and her fierce independence as a woman who did not accept restrictions, nor follow expected traditions.[Get the best of The Conversation, every weekend.

For months after  its lauded premiere  at a virtual Sundance Film Festival in January (where the movie fetched a Sundance record $25 million acquisition price and won the top prize ), Heder had heard from people who had watched \u201cCODA\u201d at home on a link about how the film moved them, how it made them cry, how important it is. But when she screened it in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where the film is set, she could finally hear something else: How big the laughs it gets are. ADVERTISEMENT\u201cYou don\u2019t really know that those work unless you\u2019re sitting in a room full of people,\u201d says Heder. \u201cCODA,\u201d which arrives Friday in theaters and on Apple TV+, is poised to be something that\u2019s been hard to find in a year light on crowds: a bona fide, heart-bursting, tell-everyone-about-it crowd-pleaser.Starring a trio of sensational actors who are deaf -- Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur and Daniel Durant \u2014 \u201cCODA\u201d is also unlike most heart-on-its-sleeve movies before it. It\u2019s a crowd-pleaser that expands just who\u2019s in \u201cthe crowd,\u201d enlarging a movie world that seldom depicts deaf lives dynamically or authentically. A landmark film in on-screen representation, \u201cCODA\u201d proves \u2014 with spirit and, yes, laughs \u2014 how much the movies have been missing.\u201cIt takes more than one person to understand to make actors who are deaf cast in films. A lot of people just aren\u2019t in the know. They don\u2019t know that we can work just as easily as anyone else,\u201d says Matlin with an interpreter. \u201cI know \u2014 I don\u2019t hope \u2014 that \u2018CODA\u2019 will change the landscape.\u201dMatlin, the only deaf actor to win an Oscar (for 1986\u2019s \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d), knows something about watershed moments for the deaf community and Hollywood. And she\u2019s convinced \u201cCODA\u201d marks something momentous. After years of reading scripts that \u2014 if they showed deaf people at all \u2014 only characterized them in simple, stereotypical ways, \u201cCODA\u201d immediately jumped out at her.\u201cI was overly excited, to the point that I called my team and said: Don\u2019t let this script get away from us. I have to do it,\u201d says Matlin.ADVERTISEMENTIn it, newcomer Emilia Jones plays the hearing daughter of a hardscrabble fishing family of two randy, funny, loving, deaf parents (Matlin, Kotsur) and her pugnacious, handsome, deaf brother Leo (Daniel Durant). Her just-developing dreams of singing seem at first like teenage rebellion. \u201cIf I was blind would you want to paint?\u201d her mother asks.\u201cCODA,\u201d which stands for \u201cchild of deaf adult(s),\u201d is based on the 2014 French film \u201cLa Famille B\u00e9lier,\u201d which used hearing actors to play the deaf parts. Heder, though, saw the potential to mine something more genuine from the story and to bring deaf actors to the forefront. She transferred the setting to the fishing town of Gloucester, Massachusetts, and made authenticity the abiding ethos. That meant shipping the cast out on fishing trips, but mostly it meant doing a lot of listening to the deaf community.Heder worked with a master in American Sign Language while writing the script and spent months learning to sign. Matlin was the first person she cast.\u201cI came into it knowing what I didn\u2019t know,\u201d says Heder. \u201cI was an outsider to this community. If I was going to be the person to tell this story, then I had to make sure that I was surrounding myself with people from this community and empowering their voices.\u201d\u201cCODA\u201d was first set up at Lionsgate but Heder is relieved it was ultimately made outside the studio system. For her, the thought of casting hearing leads -- a likely chance in a bigger production and once a possibility \u2014 was an empathic non-starter.\u201cI was like: This is how I\u2019m making the movie. If it\u2019s not with deaf actors then I don\u2019t want to make the movie at all so you guys can sit on that script and that can go nowhere and that can be a year of my life writing a script that will sit on a shelf,\u201d Heder says.In the increased attention on inclusion in the film industry,  equity for those with disabilities has sometimes been stuck in the margins  \u2014 even though one in four people in the U.S. has some type of disability. That\u2019s changed in part recently thanks to films like  the Oscar-nominated Netflix documentary \u201cCrip Camp: A Disability Revolution \u201d and the \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d films, starring Millicent Simmonds. But for a longtime, tireless advocate for the deaf community like Matlin, it\u2019s past time for others to help the cause.\u201cThe responsibility to speak on behalf of the deaf community is not mine, really,\u201d says Matlin. \u201cWe all have a responsibility. Yes, my name is very well known. And, yes, I\u2019ll accept that. But I can\u2019t do the work alone. So maybe my voice is just one of many that can make a change, that can make noise, that can create the recognition that we all need. But again, not alone. I can\u2019t do it alone any longer.\u201d\u201cCODA\u201d is hoping to be a part of that change not just in how it was made, but in how it\u2019s being released. All screenings in the U.S. and U.K. will be presented in open captions. On Apple TV+, subtitles and subtitles for the deaf will available in more than 36 languages.\u201cI\u2019m telling people: Turn the sound off when you watch those promotional materials. Think about what it\u2019s like to be in the deaf community watching that trailer,\u201d says Heder, who will next direct a biopic on disability rights activist (and \u201cCrip Camp\u201d star) Judith Heumann.\u201cI feel like my life has been enriched through my exposure to this community,\u201d Heder adds. \u201cI sign with my kids all the time now. It\u2019s become our secret family language when I want to tell my daughter something across the room.\u201dFew had a steeper learning curve than Jones, who had to get familiar enough with sign language that she looked like she\u2019s done it all her life \u2014 all while learning a very foreign culture to the young British actor.\u201cIt was the most rewarding thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI had to be a fisher girl and I\u2019ve never stepped on a fishing boat. Si\u00e2n sent us all out on that boat with fisherman for hours. And same with signing. I wasn\u2019t allowed to use an interpreter, which I\u2019m so grateful for because it made me learn faster. All of our interpreters on set were CODAs so it meant I could talk to them in depth.\u201dHearing or not, the Rossis of \u201cCODA\u201d are one of the more believable families lately seen on screen. The connection between the actors seems uncommonly lived-in.\u201cThat\u2019s something that as a director is very hard to create \u2014 like actual love on screen,\u201d says Heder. \u201cThose four people bonded in a way that I never could have expected and I think that\u2019s what people are feeling.\u201dOnly recently, though, while promoting the film, did the cast and Heder get to reunite, having not seen each other in person through the pandemic. Outside a Los Angeles hotel, they stayed up drinking margaritas by the pool.\u201cIt felt like the Rossis were back together again,\u201d says Matlin. \u201cMovies aren\u2019t really real. But this really felt real to me.\u201d___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/la-state-wire-louisiana-lifestyle-cf4962ef20b31b4191fedb143551edba", "headline": "Louisiana reorganizes schools for blind, deaf students | AP News", "date": "2021-07-04T14:06:40Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BATON ROUGE, La.

Just as poets can evoke emotions and meaning by choosing words that echo one another in English, actress and Tony nominee Lauren Ridloff chooses signs that visually echo one another in her ASL adaptation of Anne Michaels\u2019 poem \u201cNot.\u201dFor spoken languages, there are many resources that contain information about how often words are used, which words rhyme and other information not found in a dictionary. But until recently, there was no such thing for sign languages. We are four researchers who study psycholinguistics, linguistics, neuroscience and deaf education. Our team of deaf and hearing scientists worked with a group of software engineers to create the ASL-LEX database that anyone can use for free. We cataloged information on nearly 3,000 signs and built a visual, searchable and interactive database that allows scientists and linguists to work with ASL in entirely new ways.ADVERTISEMENTMental maps of languageTo communicate in any language, people must search their mental lexicon \u2013 the words or signs that they use and recognize \u2013 to perceive or produce the right vocabulary item. How quickly and efficiently they do this depends on how their lexicon is organized in their mind. The database our team built is meant to represent a mental lexicon and is allowing us to examine how signs are organized in the human mind.For example, if you looked up \u201ctease\u201d in the database, you would learn that this sign is used quite frequently in ASL. A person trying to sign \u201ctease\u201d might think of it more quickly than a rare sign like \u201clinguistics.\u201d ASL-LEX also shows that \u201ctease\u201d is visually similar to \u2013 and, in a visual way, rhymes with \u2013 other signs, like \u201cruin.\u201d These related signs might also come to mind while a person thinks of \u201ctease.\u201d Researchers believe this process of calling up similar words or signs helps people speak or sign faster.Our goals were to first catalog the information that people might use to organize their mental lexicons and then to illustrate that information visually using a network map.Building a lexiconWhen we began building the database, we focused on the most common ways that people might mentally organize their vocabulary: how frequently signs are used, how much a sign visually resembles its meaning \u2013 a concept called iconicity \u2013 and how visually similar a sign is to other signs in the lexicon. There isn\u2019t a conventional writing system for signed languages, so our team had to come up with novel methods to obtain information about the form of ASL signs.In spoken languages, words that are used more frequently tend to be learned earlier and are processed faster than infrequent words. For spoken languages, word frequency is calculated by counting words in large collections of speech \u2013 some of the biggest collections come from movies with closed captions \u2013 but there aren\u2019t collections like this for ASL. Instead, we asked 129 deaf signers from all over the U.S. to rate signs on a 7-point scale based on how often they appear in ASL signing. The higher the value, the more frequently used the sign is. Another interesting aspect of sign language is that many signs visually resemble what they mean. For example, \u201cdrink\u201d is highly iconic because it looks like the act of drinking. But \u201cbrother\u201d is not iconic because it doesn\u2019t look like an actual brother. Iconicity plays a key role in how signs are learned and organized in a person\u2019s lexicon. To measure the iconicity of signs, we asked deaf and hearing people to judge how much a sign looks like what it means on a 7-point scale. The higher the value, the more iconic the sign is. We also looked at how signs are formed \u2013 the handshape, location and movement of the body that make up a sign. Our team meticulously analyzed signs for many different properties including which fingers are involved, how bent they are, where the hands are located and other information. Organizing the map by handshapes, locations and movements illustrates how signs are visually related to one another and represents how researchers think signers might mentally organize their vocabularies.Patterns emerge in the lexiconOnce we built the database, we immediately saw interesting patterns in the ASL lexicon. For example, frequently used signs tend to be simpler and shorter than rare signs \u2013 a pattern that holds for both spoken and signed languages. \u201cMother\u201d is an example of a common and simple sign, while \u201ckangaroo\u201d is considered to be rare and quite complex. We found that signs used in everyday conversation become simpler over time to allow for more efficient communication, just like spoken words.We also found that common signs are more likely to be in clusters of visually similar words, while rare signs are more isolated. For example, the sign \u201cyou\u201d is relatively common and is visually similar to many other signs. But \u201cvampire\u201d is a rare and isolated sign. Interestingly, frequently used signs also tend to be less iconic. Iconicity seems to help communities coin new signs, but our results suggest that as signs are used more frequently, they change form and lose the visual resemblance to their meaning.A resource for research and learningOur initial exploration of ASL-LEX was fascinating, and once the database went live, other researchers began to use it. Some are studying how signs are learned or processed in the brain. Others are now using the database to develop automatic sign recognition technologies \u2013 like Alexa or Siri \u2013 for ASL.Research is only one aspect of ASL-LEX. Another purpose is to help teachers and parents of deaf children teach ASL more constructively. Children learn their first language from the people around them. But deaf children aren\u2019t typically surrounded by people who know ASL, and this can delay their language development. We hope that parents and teachers will use our freely available ASL-LEX database to identify and teach the most common and helpful signs first.Language is at the heart of all human communities, and sign languages are no exception. There is much work to be done to ensure full equity for all deaf people. Our ASL-LEX project provides a window into ASL and, by extension, the linguistic minds of those who use the language. Our team has envisioned many ways ASL-LEX could be used, but it is the thousands of unexpected  ways that researchers, educators, community members and artists could use it that we are truly excited about.[You\u2019re smart and curious about the world.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Right down to its production design, the Oscars have not always felt like the most welcoming place for people with disabilities.\u201cI\u2019ve always seen that stage with its stairs as a symbol that they don\u2019t expect people who had mobility issues to be nominated or to win an award,\u201d said Jim LeBrecht, the co-director and co-star of the Oscar-nominated documentary \u201c Crip Camp.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s always been this kind of negative tacit statement.\u201dThis year shows signs of change. LeBrecht, who has spina bifida and uses a wheelchair, will attend the April 25 ceremony. So will Robert Tarango, the deaf-blind star of the nominated short, \u201c Feeling Through.\u201dThe victors\u2019 podium will be accessible for both. And LeBrecht hopes that will become a permanent change, both literally and figuratively.The two films, along with \u201c Sound of Metal,\u201d nominated for six awards including best picture, have their nominees hoping their Oscar moment can become a catalyst for Hollywood to stop using people with disabilities as sources of inspiration, objects of pity, or twisted villains.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cI think that the goal is to alleviate the fear,\u201d Tarango said through a translator, \u201cto open the doors so that executives don\u2019t look at our ability to hear or not to hear and to see that somebody who is blind, deaf-blind, who has any kind of disability is just part of the world and can be part of these films.\u201dThe academy, under pressure, has pushed for greater race and gender inclusion in recent years. Disabled performers and filmmakers can too often be forgotten in that discussion.\u201cIt\u2019s time that people need to recognize that diversity should include the disabled, the deaf-blind and the deaf community,\u201d Marlee Matlin, an executive producer on \u201cFeeling Through\u201d and the only deaf actor to win an Oscar, said through a translator. \u201cI hope that it\u2019s not just the flavor of the year, that it goes beyond, and that this is a trend that will continue.\u201d More Oscars 2021 Coverage:\u2013 12-time Oscar nominee Diane Warren hopes for 'awesome' win\u2013 The gonzo art of writing for 'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm'\u2013 Harrison Ford, Brad Pitt join Oscars starry presenting castTraditionally in Academy Award-nominated movies, people with disabilities appear only when an actor seeking an Oscar-worthy role plays one on screen. That has led some disabled people to feel like \u201cthey\u2019re stealing our stories,\u201d said LeBrecht, a sound designer whose friend, documentary director Nicole Newnham, asked that he direct \u201cCrip Camp\u201d with her. She wanted a disability-led perspective after he suggested she make a documentary about his summer camp and its essential role in the birth of the disability rights movement. ADVERTISEMENT\u201cIf we just realize that the stories around disabilities aren\u2019t just about overcoming adversity or tragedy,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I think we could see kind of the beginning of a golden age where finally people with disabilities show their true lives, their real life experiences.\u201dPeople with disabilities have long been among the least represented groups in film and television. Last year, USC Annenberg\u2019s annual inequality report found that, only 2.3% of all speaking characters across the 100 top-grossing films of 2019 were even depicted with a disability, much less played by an actor with a disability. \u201cFeeling Through\u201d director Doug Roland called stats like that \u201cabysmal,\u201d but said his determination to cast a deaf-blind actor in the film based on a real chance encounter he had on the street, was not made from any sense of inclusion.\u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking from what I now know is the conversation around authentic representation, which I\u2019ve had like a real master class in over the last three years,\u201d Roland said. \u201cI was just thinking, you know, I think this would just be a lot more impactful if we have someone from the community be a part of this.\u201dHis search led him to the Helen Keller National Center, which helped him find Tarango, who was working in their kitchen. The center then helped him extensively through every step of the process. \u201cWe bring a culture to this,\u201d Tarango said. \u201cWe bring our independence that people don\u2019t often see. I was excited, excited and grateful honestly to Doug for picking someone who was deaf-blind, because I think that has helped in the success of the film.\u201d Full Coverage:\u00a0Academy AwardsWhen Matlin won her 1987 Oscar for \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d it felt like a major breakthrough. But a flood of roles and nominations didn\u2019t follow for deaf or other disabled actors. \u201cI thought, \u2018OK, it will break barriers,\u2019\u201d Matlin said. \u201cBut then, the focus moved away.\u201d She said the lack of social media at the time made it very difficult to apply pressure and build momentum for a cause the way the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag did for Black actors.

It\u2019s a silly phrase, really, but it takes on an urgent poignancy for three stunning minutes in \u201cCODA,\u201d Si\u00e2n Heder\u2019s refreshing, loving and altogether irresistible film about a deaf family with one hearing daughter.In this extraordinary scene, Ruby, 17 (impressive newcomer Emilia Jones) and mother Jackie (a superb Marlee Matlin) are having a heart-to-heart in Ruby\u2019s bedroom \u2014 something all of us moms and daughters have experienced, except not, because one is deaf and the other isn\u2019t. Ruby asks her mom if she ever wished that she, her only hearing child, were deaf. The answer will both make you smile and break your heart, like a lot of this movie. And then you\u2019ll realize that for the entire three minutes, you\u2019ve barely heard a sound \u2014 no spoken dialogue, just the very faintest hint of music, and the flutters of movement that accompany signing.ADVERTISEMENTIf there\u2019s a flaw to \u201cCODA\u201d \u2014 the title stems from the term \u201cchild of deaf adult\u201d -- it may be that it wears its brimming heart on its sleeve to such an extent that it occasionally nears that fine line into formula, especially when it invents plot-moving conflicts that seem unnecessary. But somehow it never crosses the line, and if you see a few predictable moments coming \u2026 well, so what? They work \u2014 boy, do they ever. If this is formula, I\u2019m OK with that, and can you pass the Kleenex? There\u2019s something in my eye.Heder, who adapted her screenplay from the 2014 French film \u201cLa Famille Belier,\u201d makes crucially effective decisions throughout, but none more important than the casting, with three extraordinary deaf actors playing the deaf family members. Matlin\u2019s well-documented talent (she\u2019s the only deaf actor to win an Oscar) is matched here by a terrific Troy Kotsur as her randy, jubilant husband Frank, and by a sensitive Daniel Durant as temperamental older brother Leo.The film begins on a commercial fishing boat, which is how the Rossi family of Gloucester, Massachusetts, earns a living. Ruby, a high-school senior, begins her mornings at 3 a.m. on that boat, serving as both deckhand and interpreter with the hearing world. Then she goes to school, where she promptly falls asleep.Naturally, Ruby\u2019s parents rely on her. That in itself creates tension. She\u2019s needed for every business meeting, every doctor\u2019s appointment. In just one of many lovely comedic scenes, a doctor tells Ruby\u2019s parents that, for reasons we won\u2019t get into here, they can\u2019t have sex for two weeks. Ruby mischievously translates that to: \u201cYou can never have sex again.\u201d (Then she admits to her shocked parents that it\u2019s just two weeks. They\u2019re shocked at that, too.)ADVERTISEMENTAnother funny moment finds Leo swiping on Tinder at the dinner table. When someone complains that it might not be the most appropriate dinner activity, a reply comes: \u201cTinder is something we can do as a family.\u201dThe joke, though, runs deep. Being a hearing person separates Ruby in many ways from the others. For example: she wants to sing in the school choir. Granted, it\u2019s because a boy she likes is joining. But when Ruby tells her mother she\u2019s joined, Jackie\u2019s response is all about how they can\u2019t share it: \u201cIf I was blind, would you want to paint?\u201dTurns out that Ruby, though she bolts from choir in embarrassment the first time she\u2019s asked to sing, truly has a voice. It takes a determined teacher to discover this, and she has one in Bernardo (a highly entertaining Eugenio Derbez) \u2014 or, as he pronounces it, Berrrrrnardo \u2014 who quickly decides to take Ruby under his wing, preparing her for an audition to the Berklee College of Music, his alma mater.But Ruby\u2019s private lessons take her away from the family at crucial times, underscoring the outsized burden she bears. Her absence from the boat one day leads to a disaster that threatens the family\u2019s livelihood. When Ruby agrees to put a stop to her dream of college, her parents are grateful but her brother erupts in bitterness, calling her \u201cSaint Ruby.\u201dJones, a British actress, had a steep learning curve: She needed to master American Sign Language, speaking in American dialect, and yes, working on a fishing boat. She clearly already could sing, though. A climactic performance of Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d \u2014 we won\u2019t give away what makes it special \u2014 rivals the emotional punch of that bedroom scene.If you studied music, you\u2019ll know \u201ccoda\u201d has another meaning \u2014 it\u2019s a certain type of ending to a piece of music. It\u2019s easy to feel that part of Ruby\u2019s life here, her childhood, is coming to its coda, especially in a late scene where she hugs her family and gets into a car.But when she runs back for another hug, straight to the camera, we also feel like she\u2019s running back to US. And that\u2019s when we realize: We\u2019ve become part of this family, and we likely won\u2019t forget them.And now pass that Kleenex again, please.\u201cCODA,\u201d an Apple release, has been rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America \u201cfor strong sexual content and language, and drug use.\u201d Running time: 112 minutes.

Taking the stand at Maxwell\u2019s sex trafficking trial, Juan Patricio Alessi said that one of her accusers, who testified under the pseudonym \u201cJane\u201d earlier this week, initially visited the house with her mother and later returned several times alone. She went to the movies and took a plane trip with Epstein, Maxwell and their guests, Alessi said.He said another of Epstein\u2019s accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, visited \u201cvery often\u201d after encountering Maxwell at former President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club. Alessi said he was chauffeuring Maxwell when she had him stop the car so she could pop out and talk to Giuffre, who was working as a spa attendant.Alessi said he sometimes picked up Giuffre or \u201cJane\u201d from their homes, on instructions from Maxwell or Epstein, and would bring the visitors to Maxwell at her desk. ADVERTISEMENTAfter that, it was \u201cnot my job to see where they were,\u201d he said. One time, Giuffre brought her boyfriend into the house with her, he said, and Maxwell said the man needed to leave and wait in the car.Alessi said he saw also \u201cmany, many, many\u201d young adult female visitors, often lounging topless by the pool, who appeared to be in their late 20s.He worked at Epstein\u2019s sprawling home from 1990 to 2002 \u2014 and admits he returned two years later to steal $6,300 in cash from Epstein\u2019s desk. He said Epstein confronted him about the theft and agreed not to press charges if Alessi repaid him, which Alessi said he did.Epstein killed himself in jail in 2019, while charged with sex trafficking counts that alleged he abused dozens of underage girls in New York and Florida. The  case against Maxwell  stems from four now-adult women who said she helped him victimize them.Giuffre\u2019s allegations, which include claims that Epstein and Maxwell trafficked her at age 17 and 18 to other prominent men who have denied it, are not part of the case.Maxwell, 59, denies the allegations against her, and her lawyers say prosecutors are going after her because they can\u2019t try Epstein.The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they decide to tell their stories publicly, as Giuffre has done.Maxwell, a British socialite, was Epstein\u2019s onetime girlfriend and, later, employee. Prosecutors said she took the girls on shopping trips and movie outings, talked to them about their lives and encouraged them to accept financial help from him.The government also says she also helped to create a sexualized atmosphere by talking with the girls about sex and encouraging them to give Epstein massages, and the woman identified as \u201cJane\u201d testified this week  that she had sexual interactions with Epstein at age 14 with Maxwell in the room and sometimes participating. Maxwell\u2019s lawyers pointed to FBI documents that said the woman gave the government a different account in 2019; she questioned the documents\u2019 accuracy. Alessi portrayed an imperious Maxwell letting it be known that she was \u201cthe lady of the house\u201d and handing out a 58-page booklet with rules for staff on everything from how to address her and Epstein to what types of notepads to put on their desks.\u201cChecklists will assist you in making sure every task has been completed and not even the smallest detail has been overlooked,\u201d the book said, instructing employees to \u201ctry to anticipate\u201d Epstein and Maxwell\u2019s needs and to \u201csee nothing, hear nothing, say nothing\u201d except when spoken to. \u201cI was supposed to be blind, deaf and dumb and say nothing of their lives,\u201d Alessi said.Staffers had to \u201crun the house like a five-star hotel,\u201d keep Epstein\u2019s cars washed and stocked with $100 bills in them for his weekend visits and avoid looking him in the eye. Maxwell said he didn\u2019t like such eye contact, according to Alessi, who said she and Epstein called him \u201cJohn\u201d instead of \u201cJuan.\u201dEarlier Thursday, psychologist Lisa Rocchio testified that child sexual abusers often groom their victims in a progression that includes giving presents, building a sense of trust and gradually introducing more sexually charged talk and touching. Before the trial, Maxwell\u2019s lawyers tried unsuccessfully to block Rocchio\u2019s testimony, saying it didn\u2019t have enough scientific grounding. After she took the stand, defense lawyer Jeffrey Pagliuca suggested that some things she described as grooming \u2014 such as giving gifts, taking children to special places or paying them attention \u2014 could also be innocuous. He recalled, for example, his grandfather taking him to the Bronx Zoo as a child.\u201cI\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t taking you there for sexual abuse,\u201d she retorted, saying that simple kindness isn\u2019t grooming \u201cin the context of a healthy and normal relationship.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-health-coronavirus-pandemic-78879e861a14aadbbd62f165856c3fa0", "headline": "Paralympian withdraws after request for mom's help denied | AP News", "date": "2021-07-21T05:13:29Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 American swimmer Becca Meyers has pulled out of the Paralympics because she says the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee won\u2019t let her bring her mother to Tokyo as her personal care assistant.Meyers, who is deaf and blind as the result of a rare genetic disorder, won three gold medals at the last Paralympics.

(AP) \u2014 The Montana Supreme Court has ordered a new trial for a Great Falls man who was convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl who is deaf and has developmental disabilities, saying he was denied his constitutional right to confront his accuser. The court ruled 5-2 on Tuesday that the trial judge shouldn\u2019t have allowed a nurse, a child protection specialist with the Department of Public Health and Human Services and a police officer to testify about what the girl told them while they were investigating the 2016 report because defendant Richard Lee Tome did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the alleged victim.\u201cWe have little doubt that, qualitatively, the testimony from the three witnesses alone and the recorded (health department) interview contributed to the conviction of Tome,\u201d Justice Laurie McKinnon wrote for the majority.The girl was found to be not competent to testify during the 2018 trial because she didn\u2019t appear to understand the concept of the truth versus a lie. ADVERTISEMENTTome, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole until he completed two phases of sex offender treatment, did not challenge the admissibility of testimony by a school psychologist and a behavioral specialist at the Montana School for the Deaf and Blind in Great Falls, where the girl first reported the alleged rape.In their dissent, Justices Jim Rice and Beth Baker argued there were exceptions to requirements that people be allowed to confront their accusers. They said the U.S. Supreme Court made it clear that the confrontation clause does not bar prior statements of a person who is unable to communicate to the jury at the time of trial. The cross-examination of a witness incapable of testifying can serve no legitimate purpose, Rice wrote.\u201cIf the most vulnerable victims of abuse in our society cannot be heard \u2014 ever \u2014 then there is something wrong with the constitutional rule,\u201d Rice wrote.The dissent also noted that the Montana Legislature passed a law in 2007 allowing hearsay statements to be admissible to prove the occurrence of a crime or identification of an abuser in the case of physical or sexual abuse of a person with a developmental disability. Prosecutors must give defendants sufficient notice that such evidence will be used.During Tome\u2019s trial, the girl\u2019s mother testified she was in the home at the time of the alleged rape and didn\u2019t hear or see anything that led her to believe anything was wrong, the Great Falls Tribune reported.However, a fellow inmate at the Cascade County Detention Center testified that Tome told him he was arrested for raping a disabled child and he was going to get away with it because he used a condom, court records said.There was no DNA evidence linking Tome to the alleged rape, court records said.

Deputies gave her commands to drop the gun, then she pointed the gun at the deputies, and a deputy-involved shooting occurred,\u201d the department said.Sheriff\u2019s Department spokeswoman Jodi Miller told the Victorville Daily Press that the deputies found no sign of intruders at the property.Miller said the number of shots fired by deputies was not being released due to the ongoing investigation, the newspaper reported.New Hampshire state legislator Susan DeLemus, a relative of Francois, told the Daily Press that Francois was legally blind and deaf.DeLemus, a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, said her husband, Jerry DeLemus, is a nephew of Francois.Jerry DeLemus is serving a prison term after pleading guilty to federal charges stemming from the 2014 armed standoff at the Nevada ranch of states\u2019 rights advocate Cliven Bundy.Susan DeLemus described Francois as a \u201cprecious and petite little lady.\u201d\u201cShe was born in 1929, and the police felt so threatened by her that they had to shoot her,\u201d DeLemus told the Daily Press. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been strong, faithful and trying to make the best of a bad situation. \u2026 The entire family is upset and concerned.

The woman who 40 years ago this month started Utah\u2019s internationally recognized and widely modeled Parent-Infant Program for the Blind and Visually Impaired likes to talk instead about how much she learns from the people she works to assist.\u201cI consider myself a cross-pollinator,\u201d she says. \u201cI learn so much from everybody I work with. I get something in one place, then I\u2019m willing to share at the next place.\u201dADVERTISEMENTThe sharing began in the early 1980s when Dennison headed out in a station wagon with a master\u2019s degree under her belt to identify visually impaired babies and toddlers around Utah and set up a network of special-education providers to serve the families of those children. The aim was to fill a critical gap in child-development services for the blind and visually impaired between birth and preschool, ages 1 to 3.\u201cIn the first year of the new program, I traveled the state trying to find the babies needing help, and then we were looking at hiring people in those communities to bring to Ogden and train. Then they started working with the babies.\u201d Dennison recalls. \u201cEvery three months I was traveling all over the state to make visits with those new interventionists, providing more on-the-job training and supervision, and we did special sessions with parents.\u201dInitially funded through a four-year federal grant, the program was the first of its kind in Utah. After gaining ongoing funding through the Utah Legislature, it has eventually become a model for programs everywhere, leading Dennison to divide her time between serving families and training others to do the same.\u201cOne of the most awkward things I do in my position is to introduce myself as Bess\u2019 boss because she is so remarkably knowledgeable,\u201d said Karen Borg, a former member of the Logan Municipal Council who went on to direct the Parent-Infant Program through the Utah School for the Deaf and Blind in Ogden. \u201cBess is really a pioneer in the field. At first, that\u2019s all there was was Bess, and through the years she has trained people in other states as well as other countries. She still does that. She goes out to places that are not as fortunate as Utah. Utah really is on the cutting edge of services for children with sensory loss, for vision and hearing.\u201dADVERTISEMENTAt the moment, Dennison is doing Zoom sessions through an outreach program run by Utah State University\u2019s SKI-HI Institute, training a group of about 20 teachers in Tennessee and West Virginia who will launch those states\u2019 first parent-infant programs. She also is working with eight local visually impaired infants and their families, some of the roughly 200 Utah families currently receiving service.Though now at retirement age, Dennison has no plans to step away from her career. As she puts it, \u201cI love what I do too much. I\u2019m not ready to stop yet. I\u2019ve pulled back on my hours some, but as long as my health holds out and I love what I\u2019m doing, I think I\u2019ll continue with a small caseload.\u201dWhen Dennison and other professionals she calls \u201cearly interventionists\u201d enter a home, it\u2019s as much about working with parents as it is working with infants \u2014 passing on techniques the adults can use with their infants who are blind or visually impaired to acclimate them to the world around them.One of the techniques is \u201croutine-based learning,\u201d which incorporates tactile exploration for the child into everyday activities like diaper-changing and feeding. This serves the dual purpose of aiding the baby\u2019s development on a regular basis while making the teaching process less demanding and stressful for often-overworked parents.\u201cBess is superb at that (balancing parental and infant needs),\u201d Borg said. \u201cShe\u2019s extremely humble. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dDennison herself describes entering homes to provide assistance as \u201can honor\u201d as opposed to a job, because among other things she gets to share in many tender moments within families.\u201cWe are there to celebrate and enjoy their child with them and just help wherever we can,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to be there and support the process and help them enjoy their child. They\u2019re parents first, but they don\u2019t have to be a constant teacher. Sometimes they have to be able to just enjoy their child.\u201dDennison said her first few visits to a home are devoted to not only to assessing a child\u2019s disabilities but gauging the parents\u2019 situation and exploring what she can do \u201cto make it a little bit easier for them to help their little ones and help them learn to do what all babies learn to do.\u201dLittle ones. That\u2019s what Dennison calls the infants she works with.\u201cWith the little ones, you try to look at the positive, what they are able to do, and then build from there, not focus on what they aren\u2019t able to do, and love them for where they are, accept them for where they are,\u201d she said.There was a time when many blind or deaf children were institutionalized, but in the years that Dennison has worked with visually impaired kids and their parents, the world has seen a massive shift in how such cases are handled. This is something her efforts have no doubt contributed to.\u201cWhen I first came to Utah in the early 1980s there were little children in the first couple of years of life whose families were being encouraged by other families and sometimes their own doctors to put them away in institutions,\u201d Dennison said. \u201cThere was a big institution down around Provo somewhere that had a lot of little ones, because parents didn\u2019t have the support they needed to help. That\u2019s not the way it is anymore. These kids are staying home with their families who love them and care about them. The parents are getting the support they need.\u201dA key to effective intervention, she says, is catching a visual impairment early in a child\u2019s life so adaptations can begin, but this is often missed because many children with limited vision also are born with other challenges.For people of Dennison\u2019s generation, the story of Helen Keller has served as a guidepost for what can be accomplished by a determined and savvy interventionist working with a child. Keller was born both deaf and blind, but with the help of teacher Anne Sullivan she grew up to become a world-renowned public speaker in the early 20th century.The Keller-Sullivan story was dramatically portrayed in the 1962 movie \u201cThe Miracle Worker,\u201d and that title also seems fitting in relation to Dennison\u2019s pioneering work in the field.Asked what she would most like the general public to know about early intervention programs like the one she hit the road to start in Utah four decades ago, Dennison stressed the importance of continued funding:\u201cGetting these services to children in the very beginning really helps them get a better start in life because in the years before we had these programs, some of these kids were getting ready to start preschool or maybe kindergarten and were oftentimes behind in their development. \u2026 Those little brains are the most malleable in the first few years of life, and it\u2019s critical for us to impact their learning in a positive way and help families not to be alone in dealing with this.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/impeachments-fires-arizona-5e40ae99e7018d2daeb19069aac06149", "headline": "Arizona history -April 4-10 | AP News", "date": "2021-03-31T17:15:07Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "Sunday, April 4On this date in 1825, Charles T.

(AP) \u2014 Maryland\u2019s governor honored deaf and blind swimmer Becca Meyers on Monday for courage in championing the disabled, after the three-time gold medalist withdrew from the Paralympics in Tokyo when told her mother couldn\u2019t travel to the games as her personal care assistant.Gov. Larry Hogan presented a citation to Meyers during a news conference commemorating the 31st anniversary of the American with Disabilities Act. The certificate honored her \u201cbravery for highlighting the issue of inequality and access for people with disabilities.\u201d Hogan also signed an executive order declaring that Maryland will annually celebrate July as Disability Culture and Achievements Month. \u201cBecca deserved to be able to compete, and while we\u2019re all so disappointed for her, I got the chance to tell her just a moment before this started that I\u2019m unbelievably proud of her for having the courage to speak up and to speak out about this injustice,\u201d Hogan said.ADVERTISEMENTMeyers, 26, said the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee had approved her mother to act as her assistant at all international meets since 2017 but the committee said her request to bring her mother this time was denied due to restrictions put in place by the Japanese government due to COVID-19. Meyers said she made the decision to withdraw to stand up for future Paralympic athletes, saying she didn\u2019t want them to have to experience what she\u2019s been through.\u201cI hope to work with others to effect change so that no one ever feels afraid to travel with Team USA,\u201d Meyers said.Hogan said he told Meyers before Monday\u2019s news conference that while he was proud of her for being a gold-medal winner, he was even more proud of her speaking up to set an example for younger athletes. The governor criticized the decision not to allow her mother to travel to the games.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of problems with this Olympics, but that was probably the one that stood out the most with me,\u201d Hogan said.The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, or USOPC, said that because of the pandemic, there are increased restrictions on delegation size at the Tokyo Games, which left the federation only one slot for a personal care assistant who will have to assist 34 Paralympic swimmers. The PCA has more than 27 years of coaching experience and 11 years with para swimmers, the USOPC said.\u201cThe decisions we\u2019ve made on behalf of the team have not been easy, and we are heartbroken for athletes who are unable to have their previous support resources available,\u201d the USOPC said. \u201cWe are confident in the level of support we will offer Team USA and look forward to providing them a positive athlete experience even in the most unprecedented times.\u201dAt the 2016 Rio Paralympic games, Meyers said she experienced emotional and physical trauma from not being able to navigate on her own throughout the Olympic village.\u201cI need that reasonable and essential accommodation to then be able to perform to the best of my ability on the world stage,\u201d Meyers told reporters after Hogan presented her with a certificate."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-f3611448da5e6e8f81d7ff93295ae03e", "headline": "Saturday's Scores", "date": "2021-08-29T04:00:53Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "PREP FOOTBALL=Argyle 45, FW Nolan 29Austin TSD 57, California School for the Deaf-Riverside, Calif. 40Austin TSD 57, Joshua Johnson County 40Carrollton Creekview 47, FW Western Hills 21Cleburne 43, Houston Heights 42Conroe Oak Ridge 28, League City Clear Creek 24Cypress Bridgeland 54, Klein Cain 14Dallas Parish Episcopal 34, Bellaire Episcopal 14Denton Ryan 40, Longview 7Follett 46, Aspermont 0Fort Bend Dulles 27, Fort Bend Kempner 0Gordon 66, O\u2019Donnell 20Grandfalls-Royalty 39, Marfa 6Grapevine Faith 30, Colleyville Covenant 6Harper 14, D\u2019Hanis 7Houston Emery/Weiner School 60, Tribe Consolidated 24Jersey Village 51, Alief Hastings 7Katy Morton Ranch 48, Cypress Lakes 6Katy Taylor 33, Cypress Springs 29Katy Tompkins 18, Magnolia 6Laredo United 33, Pflugerville 14McKinney 35, Har-Ber, Ark. 28McKinney North 44, Westmoore, Okla. 26Montgomery 27, New Caney Porter 9Morton 26, Tom Bean 22Oakwood 44, Gilmer Union Hill 24Plano Coram Deo 48, McDade 8Richmond George Ranch 38, Houston Lamar 33SA Northside Jay 52, Laredo Johnson 0SA Northside Marshall 61, SA MacArthur 0Tenaha 35, Honey Grove 0Tomball Homeschool 28, Yates 6Wylie Prep 72, Saint Jo 22POSTPONEMENTS AND CANCELLATIONS=Dallas South Oak Cliff vs. Legacy School of Sport Sciences, ccd.Gladewater Union Grove vs. Burkeville, ccd.___Some high school football scores provided by Scorestream.com, https://scorestream.com/"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-3108e8ee59789be7cd1f9f07858a47c5", "headline": "Thursday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2021-06-04T06:14:51Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BOYS PREP BASKETBALL=Bainbridge 69, Sequim 42Bellevue Christian 42, Vashon Island 35Bremerton 59, Central Kitsap 58Cashmere 82, Warden 32Central Valley 69, Gonzaga Prep 58Chelan 80, Cascade (Leavenworth) 54Clarkston 57, West Valley (Spokane) 44Cle Elum/Roslyn 62, Pateros 42Columbia Adventist Academy 47, Washington School For The Deaf 33Coupeville 48, Mount Vernon Christian 46Crosspoint Academy 54, Puget Sound Adventist 31Curtis 82, Peninsula 50Cusick 68, Curlew 39Emerald Ridge 77, Olympia 67Ferris 59, Lewis and Clark 48Forks 77, Chief Leschi 45Fort Vancouver 69, Woodland 46Freeman 64, Colville 53Gig Harbor 63, Bellarmine Prep 62Hanford 82, Pasco 40Kent Meridian 47, Mt.

By most studios\u2019 box-office standards, the opening was enviable. Only three other films have debuted better during the pandemic: \u201cBlack Widow\u201d ($80.3 million), \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\u201d ($75.3 million) and \u201cVenom: Let There Be Carnage\u201d ($90 million). But for Marvel\u2019s well-oiled blockbuster machine, the \u201cEternals\u201d launch in some ways constituted a bump in the road in an unparalleled 26-film streak. Going into the weekend, forecasts had been only slightly higher at about $75 million domestically. More concerning for the Walt Disney Co. was the mixed audience response to Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s 157-minute movie about an immortal race of superheroes. The film is the first in the Marvel \u201ccinematic universe\u201d to rank \u201crotten\u201d in Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 aggregate critic score, with only 47% of reviews considered positive. Audiences also gave it a lower grade \u2014 a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore \u2014 than any previous MCU entry. ADVERTISEMENTBut from the start, \u201cEternals\u201d was a less charted direction for Marvel. By enlisting Zhao, whose \u201cNomadland\u201d earlier this year won best picture and best director at the Academy Awards, the comic-book factory tapped a lauded filmmaker more associated with arthouse realism than computer-generated spectacle. The story, too, introduces a lesser-known alien class of superheroes, whose existence spans all of human history. With a teeming, diverse cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie and Kumail Nanjiani, \u201cEternals\u201d dared numerous introductions \u2014 including the MCU\u2019s first deaf superhero in Lauren Ridloff and the first superhero sex scene \u2014 not tried before in the franchise. David A. Gross, who runs the movie consultancy Franchise Entertainment Research, estimates the negative reception to \u201cEternals\u201d cost it a modest 10% in box office. He still sees superhero films as driving the recovery of theaters. Marvel movies account for the the top four openings of the pandemic. \u201c\u2018Eternals\u2019 is by no means a problem,\u201d Gross said in an email. \u201cThe film isn\u2019t connecting the way every other Marvel film has, but the box office performance is solid and it maintains October\u2019s level of business.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT\u201cEternals,\u201d which cost about $200 million to produce, opened strongly overseas, grossing $90.7 million in 46 international territories. The film, however, didn\u2019t open in China and isn\u2019t expected to be granted a release in the future despite being directed by a China-born filmmaker. The previous Marvel release, \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\u201d the studio\u2019s first Asian superhero movie, also hasn\u2019t received permission to open in China. The reasons for the refusal aren\u2019t clear, but China heavily censors the films it clears for release. U.S.-China relations have grown more tense in recent years. It\u2019s also been widely noted that Zhao said in a 2013 interview that China is \u201cwhere there are lies everywhere.\u201d In April, her Oscar wins went unreported by China state-run media outlets and mentions of them were scrubbed from the internet in China. The weekend\u2019s other major new release was  \u201cSpencer,\u201d starring Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana. The acclaimed drama, which is expected to land Stewart her first Oscar nomination, launched in 996 locations and grossed $2.1 million for Neon. The rest of the weekend\u2019s top draws were holdovers. In its third weekend of release, Denis Villeneuve\u2019s sci-fi epic \u201cDune\u201d took in $7.6 million for a cumulative total of $83.9 million. Warner Bros., which has announced a sequel to \u201cDune,\u201d released the film simultaneously on HBO Max. MGM and United Artists Releasing\u2019s James Bond entry \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d grossed $6.1 million in its fifth weekend of release, bringing its domestic haul to $143.2 million.

The Federal Communications Commission last summer voted  to require phone companies support the 988 number for people to call to reach an existing suicide-prevention hotline. Recognizing that texting is critical to Americans, particularly young people and those who are deaf, have hearing loss or speech disabilities, the commission on Thursday voted 4-0 to require a texting option as well. \u201cFor millions of us, especially young people and those with disabilities \u2014 they are more likely to text than they are to call when they are in crisis,\u201d said FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel during the agency\u2019s meeting Thursday. \u201cThe bottom line is it should not matter when you make a voice call or send a text message, because we should connect people in crisis to the resources they need, no matter how they communicate.\u201dADVERTISEMENTCurrently, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline uses a 10-digit number, 800-273-TALK (8255), which routes calls to about 170 crisis centers. Phone companies have until July 2022 to implement the 988 number for both calling and texting. The FCC said Thursday that the country\u2019s largest cellphone companies AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon already support calling 988. Suicide-prevention experts have said that the three-digit hotline could be a breakthrough that helps people in crisis. Suicide rates have largely been going up in the U.S. for the past two decades, although they dropped slightly last year, when nearly 45,000 people died by suicide.\u201cTexting to 988 is a huge step forward in improving how you address mental health,\u201d said Hannah Wesolowski, director of government relations for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. \u201cText messaging is a central part of how people communicate and for many individuals the primary way they communicate.\u201dShe said that that demand for the hotline \u201cis going to skyrocket\u201d next year when the 988 system is fully in place and people actually know about it, and that resources are going to have to increase as well so that people\u2019s calls and texts are answered."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-football-high-school-football-ddf751da68ceb110e834b06273cc9820", "headline": "Thursday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2021-10-08T04:03:55Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "PREP FOOTBALL=Cave Springs 36, Watts 6El Reno 56, Capitol Hill 0Heritage Hall 49, Bridge Creek 30Life Christian 66, Oklahoma School for the Deaf 38Newcastle 43, Weatherford 7Norman North 29, Moore 6___Some high school football scores provided by Scorestream.com, https://scorestream.com/___Information from: ScoreStream Inc., http://ScoreStream.com"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-high-school-basketball-a2eeff35b579b85aee17b8a311975199", "headline": "Tuesday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2021-12-01T04:32:59Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "GIRLS PREP BASKETBALL=Greenwood Mennonite School, Del. 44, Worcester Prep School 33Maryland School for the Deaf 44, Heritage Academy 41___Some high school basketball scores provided by Scorestream.com, https://scorestream.com/"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-high-school-basketball-5b2ed6b07b88b7ea8845da9b44d6a3e1", "headline": "Tuesday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2021-12-01T04:32:58Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BOYS PREP BASKETBALL=Good Counsel 78, John Carroll 64Heritage Academy 63, Maryland School for the Deaf 53Seton School, Va. 83, Heights 78Worcester Prep School 37, Greenwood Mennonite School, Del. 24___Some high school basketball scores provided by Scorestream.com, https://scorestream.com/"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-football-high-school-football-c9962878828f040c8c84dc265fa4a2a9", "headline": "Monday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2021-09-21T01:09:34Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "PREP FOOTBALL=Maryland School for the Deaf 50, Hancock 0North Hagerstown 42, Tuscarora 6___Some high school football scores provided by Scorestream.com, https://scorestream.com/___Information from: ScoreStream Inc., http://ScoreStream.com"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-high-school-basketball-2074f8179745b3bedb12e4a4e83c3de2", "headline": "Friday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2021-12-04T03:35:31Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "GIRLS PREP BASKETBALL=Greenwood Mennonite School, Del. 32, Maryland School for the Deaf 24Holly Grove 32, Salisbury 30___Some high school basketball scores provided by Scorestream.com, https://scorestream.com/"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-high-school-basketball-6c53d4534e1ced1b1b7c201ef8cf5045", "headline": "Thursday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2021-12-03T02:47:53Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BOYS PREP BASKETBALL=Bremen 68, LaVille 40Ev.

Legislators created a $550 million fund for possible construction projects still in the planning phase. An additional $900 million of federal money was set aside for unspecified future state construction projects. Another $60 million was earmarked for the state\u2019s recreational trails construction program.ADVERTISEMENTBecause the budget bill did not specify amounts, projects will tap the money on a first-come-first-served basis.The State Budget Committee has so far authorized more than $100 million in spending on early planning and designs for nearly a dozen proposed projects.Among the first projects underway is the replacement of a century-old swine barn at the Indiana State Fairgrounds with a new multi-use facility, renamed Fall Creek Pavilion. State officials in June released money for the $50 million project that\u2019s anticipated to include a restoration of the front fa\u00e7ade of the original swine barn and total reconstruction of the rest of the structure. That includes an addition of 50,000 square feet (1.15 acres), bringing its total size to 197,000 square feet (2.23 acres), which will allow the facility to host large sporting events.Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb broke ground at the site Friday, lauding the upgrade as a long-term revenue generator.\u201cWhat we didn\u2019t want to do is find ourselves in a position where we were just growing government. We wanted to be able to pay off or avoid debt, avoid interest payments,\u201d Holcomb said of the state\u2019s investment in construction projects. \u201cIndiana has never seen a three-, five-, 10-year horizon like we\u2019re looking at right now.\u201dFair officials said the goal is to finish the project before the start of the 2023 fair. A new state archives building and an inn at northern Indiana\u2019s Potato Creek State Park are also coming to fruition six years after former governor and Vice President Mike Pence failed to finance the projects as part of the state\u2019s bicentennial celebration.The former Republican governor\u2019s contested plan to pay for the construction endeavors by leasing out state-owned cellphone towers through a public-private partnership were scrapped by Holcomb, Pence\u2019s successor, shortly after taking office in 2017.ADVERTISEMENTThe state archives moved from the basement of the state library to an Indianapolis warehouse in 2001. The move was meant to be temporary however, given that the location is not equipped for long-term preservation of some of the state\u2019s most important documents, including the state\u2019s constitutions, governors\u2019 papers, and acts of the Indiana General Assembly. An initial $5 million approved by the state budget committee will go toward designs for the facility, which executive director Chandler Lighty said will have improved archival capabilities for materials needing \u201crigorous preservation.\u201d Some records, including those with shorter retention schedules, will continue to be housed in the current warehouse building. Any leftover funds could be used to secure a site for the new building.Another $5 million has been released to begin conceptual and design processes for a new state park inn \u2014 the first to be built in Indiana since 1939.The new state budget additionally set aside more than $500 million for public safety and prison projects. Nearly a half-billion dollars is budgeted for Northwest Indiana projects. The larger project -- a $400 million rebuilding of the Westville Correctional Center in LaPorte County \u2013 will demolish and rebuild nearly all of the 76-year-old prison. The facility will include new inmate housing, administration, programming and treatment facilities, according to the Indiana Department of Correction.The budget committee has so far approved $12 million for architectural and engineering design work to begin. Construction could start as early as 2022.A second project will see the construction of a new $25.5 million Indiana State Police Post and laboratory in Lowell. State police said constructing a post and lab inside one building at Lowell will add needed space, bolster operational functionality and improve energy efficiency.Championed by lawmakers, however, is the allocation of $70 million to upgrade the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy\u2019s nearly 50-year-old training facility in Plainfield. The academy, which trains roughly 65% of the state\u2019s officers, is still determining what improvements are most needed, executive director Tim Horty said. Once that\u2019s decided, construction is likely to take several years to complete, but classes at the facility will continue.\u201cThe initial expenses are to start a campus renovation, and move us towards a more modern, adult-type of learning environment, where the students are more hands-on and away from the classroom and a pen and pencil kind of examination,\u201d Horty said.Other big ticket capital projects eligible for state dollars include a new Evansville Police Post and Lab, a new consolidated campus for the Indiana School for the Deaf and the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired, and improvements to the former GM Stamping Plant in Indianapolis.___Casey Smith is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Today\u2019s Highlight in History: On March 3, 1931, \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d became the national anthem of the United States as President Herbert Hoover signed a congressional resolution. On this date: In 1791, Congress passed a measure taxing distilled spirits; it was the first internal revenue act in U.S. history. In 1845, Florida became the 27th state. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln signed a measure creating the National Academy of Sciences.ADVERTISEMENTIn 1887, Anne Sullivan arrived at the Tuscumbia, Alabama, home of Captain and Mrs. Arthur H. Keller to become the teacher for their deaf-blind 6-year-old daughter, Helen.In 1943, in London\u2019s East End, 173 people died in a crush of bodies at the Bethnal Green tube station, which was being used as a wartime air raid shelter. In 1945, the Allies fully secured the Philippine capital of Manila from Japanese forces during World War II.In 1960, Lucille Ball filed for divorce from her husband, Desi Arnaz, a day after they had finished filming the last episode of \u201cThe Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show.\u201dIn 1974, a Turkish Airlines DC-10 crashed shortly after takeoff from Orly Airport in Paris, killing all 346 people on board. In 1991, motorist Rodney King was severely beaten by Los Angeles police officers in a scene captured on amateur video. Twenty-five people were killed when a United Airlines Boeing 737-200 crashed while approaching the Colorado Springs airport. In 1996, Israel declared \u201ctotal war\u201d against the militant group Hamas after a bus bomb in Jerusalem killed 19 people, including the bomber, the third such suicide attack in eight days. In 2001, a plane carrying members of a National Guard engineering crew crashed in heavy rain near Macon, Ga., killing all 21 people on board. In 2019, a tornado roared into the small community of Beauregard, Alabama, killing 23 people; it was the nation\u2019s deadliest tornado in nearly six years.Ten years ago: Seeking to repair damaged relations, President Barack Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon agreed during a White House meeting to deepen their cooperation in combating drug violence and declared a breakthrough in efforts to end a long-standing dispute over cross-border trucking. Soldiers backing Ivory Coast\u2019s defiant leader, Laurent Gbagbo (loh-RAHN\u2019 BAHG\u2019-boh), mowed down women protesting his refusal to leave power in a hail of gunfire, killing seven.ADVERTISEMENTFive years ago: Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz leveled withering criticism at Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cflexible\u201d policy positions and personal ethics during a Republican presidential debate in Detroit. President Barack Obama visited Milwaukee to highlight how his signature health insurance overhaul had helped millions of Americans gain coverage. North Korea fired six short-range projectiles into the sea hours after the U.N. Security Council approved the toughest sanctions on Pyongyang in two decades.One year ago: In a surprise move, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a half-point, its largest cut in more than a decade, to support the economy in the face of the spreading coronavirus. Stocks rallied briefly on the news, then went into another steep slide. The known virus death toll in the United States climbed to nine; most victims were residents of a Seattle-area nursing home. The number of virus patients who had died in Italy rose to 79, the most of any nation outside of China. The head of the World Health Organization asked people to stop hoarding masks, saying they were needed by health care workers. A series of tornadoes struck middle Tennessee, including one that carved a 60-mile path in and around Nashville; the storms left 24 people dead. Joe Biden scored wins in states across the Democrats\u2019 Super Tuesday presidential primary map.Today\u2019s Birthdays: Singer-musician Mike Pender (The Searchers) is 80.

(AP) \u2014 One of the leaders of a St. Louis charter school has been appointed to the State Board of Education by Missouri Gov. Mike Parson. Kerry Casey will begin serving on the state board immediately, the governor\u2019s office said Monday. Her term will run until July, 1, 2027, if she is confirmed by the state Senate. The State Board of Education oversees Missouri\u2019s 518 public school districts, 37 charter schools and state schools for the blind, deaf and severely disabled. Casey, of Chesterfield, was a founding board member of the KIPP Charter School in St. Louis and continues to serve on its board. She also is vice president for global sales at Exegy, a financial markets data company. She replaces Victor Lenz of St. Louis, whose term on the State Board of Education expired in July 2019. Missouri law allows board members to continue serving until the governor appoints a replacement. Lenz had been serving as the board\u2019s vice president. Two other board members also are serving on expired terms \u2014 President Charlie Shields of St. Joseph, whose term expired in July 2020, and Donald Claycomb of Linn, whose term expired this past July.

(AP) \u2014 Gov. Chris Sununu issued an order Thursday expanding access to mental health services, in response to a recent state Supreme Court ruling that psychiatric patients being held involuntarily in emergency rooms must be given a chance to contest their detention promptly.The order adds beds at receiving facilities and ensures services are received from health care providers. It also ensures better community partnerships.\u201cThis order will also review all mental health services across the entire state to determine if the providers we currently utilize are truly equipped and truly capable of meeting the need of New Hampshire citizens, and we are going to be exploring additional opportunities, both in and out state in the private sector,\u201d Sununu said at his weekly news conference.The state achieved a major milestone in April 2020 when, for the first time in eight years, no one was waiting in a hospital emergency room for an inpatient psychiatric bed. But the numbers went back up during the pandemic and in recent days, more than 80 mental health patients, including record numbers of children, have been waiting in emergency departments for inpatient beds.\u201cWe\u2019re literally doing it today as we speak,\u201d Sununu said. \u201cFolks are being transferred out, beds are being opened up, investments are being made. Seek out those services.\u201dHe said the most pressing issue is that \u201cwe go back to where we were about a year ago, where folks just aren\u2019t waiting in emergency rooms anymore, where those services are being provided,\u201d and creating a long-term plan.In other coronavirus-related news:ADVERTISEMENTWALK-IN VACCINE CLINICSStarting next week, New Hampshire will allow people without an appointment to walk into its state-run COVID-19 vaccination sites.People will be allowed to go to the clinics from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. as of Monday.Also, two special clinics have been scheduled. The first one, on Friday, May 21, is for residents in New Hampshire and Vermont and will be held in Lancaster. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be administered.The other clinic is for the deaf and hard of hearing, on Saturday, May 22, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at The Elliot Health System in Manchester. American Sign Language interpreters will be provided. Appointments can be made through videophone at 603-546-7882, Voice at 603-271-9097, and email at equityvaccine@dhhs.nh.gov.___UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITNew Hampshire is planning to end the $300-a-week supplemental federal payment for people collecting state unemployment benefits before it expires on Labor Day, Gov. Chris Sununu said Thursday.About 10 states have already announced they are planning to stop accepting the $300 benefit.Sununu, a Republican who first addressed the subject earlier in the day at the Business & Industry Association of New Hampshire\u2019s virtual economic summit, did not give a date for when the enhancement would be discontinued.The BIA recently wrote to Sununu asking that the benefit come to an end, saying it \u201cmakes it easier for some unemployed individuals to choose to stay at home rather than return to work.\u201dOn May 23, the state will require those receiving unemployment benefits to show they are actively searching for work.___SENATE MEETSThe New Hampshire Senate met in person Thursday for the first time during the current legislative session.\u201cCongratulations for working together to make today happen,\u201d Senate President Chuck Morse told his colleagues at the Statehouse.The Senate met in Representatives Hall \u2014 traditionally the home of the New Hampshire House \u2014 as it had last year. The House has been meeting at a sports complex in Bedford this session.Senate members observed wearing masks and social distancing. Earlier this month, the Republican-led Joint Facilities Committee voted to remove a requirement that masks be worn to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the Statehouse and legislative office building. The Statehouse remains closed to everyone but lawmakers and staff.Among its actions Thursday, the Senate gave preliminary approval to a bill that would delete a requirement that a private school be nonsectarian in order to be approved as a school tuition program. Supporters said the bill relates to towns that don\u2019t have all grade levels and allows parents to be more involved in their children\u2019s education.Opponents said the bill, which originated in the House, would authorize public funds to send children to religious schools, which violates the state constitution.___VISITING INMATESThe New Hampshire Department of Corrections is going to allow inmates to request in-person visits, which had been suspended during the coronavirus pandemic.New Hampshire Public Radio reports that inmates who have been vaccinated will be able to hug their visitors. They will also be able to sit at the same table without remaining 6 feet (2 meters) apart. Those who have not been vaccinated will not be allowed those accommodations.Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people in the state prisons and their visitors will be required to wear masks. Visitors will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms.The department is planning to start visits the week of June 7.___THE NUMBERSMore than 97,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in New Hampshire, including 222 cases announced Thursday. Four new deaths were announced, with the total reaching 1,326.The Associated Press is using data collected by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering to measure outbreak caseloads and deaths across the United States.The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in New Hampshire decreased over the past two weeks, going from 287 new cases a day on April 27 to 173 new cases a day Tuesday.___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/health-suicide-prevention-technology-business-government-and-politics-0d0ba91413a5ac8f79f37be9d1927464", "headline": "Texting option weighed for upcoming '988' suicide hotline | AP News", "date": "2021-04-22T19:52:50Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "Recognizing that many Americans rely on texting, U.S. regulators are weighing whether to require that phone companies allow people to text a suicide hotline. The Federal Communications Commission  last summer voted to require a new \u201c988\u201d number for people to call to reach a suicide-prevention hotline. Phone companies have until July 2022 to implement it.Once it\u2019s in place, people will be able to dial 988 to seek help, similar to how 911 is used for emergencies. Currently, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline uses a 10-digit number, 800-273-TALK (8255), which routes calls to about 170 crisis centers. Crisis counselors began responding to texts sent to the Lifeline last August, the FCC said. On Thursday, the agency voted unanimously to start a process that would also require phone companies to let people text 988. The agency noted the importance of texting for young people and those who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech disabilities. \u201cWhile a voice hotline has its benefits, traditional telephone calls are no longer native communications for many young people. Texting is where they turn first,\u201d said FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement. \u201cSo it\u2019s time to make the suicide prevention hotline text accessible with 988.\u201dADVERTISEMENTIt\u2019s not clear when texting would be available for the 988 number. FCC rules often take months to complete. Suicide-prevention experts have said that the three-digit hotline could be a breakthrough that helps people in crisis. Suicide rates have largely been going up in the U.S. for the past two decades, although t hey dropped last year during the pandemic."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-basketball-arizona-phoenix-high-school-basketball-c67d9e4d4fbe45c187f3b0a59caef62e", "headline": "Saturday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2021-12-12T03:56:31Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "GIRLS PREP BASKETBALL=Buckeye 37, Phoenix Alhambra 13Chinle 46, Rock Point 41El Dorado 77, Scottsdale Chaparral 75Eloy Santa Cruz 36, Basis Charter Phoenix 25Flagstaff 52, Sedona Red Rock 37Flagstaff 63, Pima 46Holbrook 46, Ft.

Under the plan, the devices could be ordered online or bought over-the-counter at pharmacies and other retail stores.The move follows years of pressure from medical experts and consumer advocates to make the devices cheaper and easier to get. More than 37 million Americans, or 15% of adults, have trouble hearing, according to the FDA, but only about one-fifth of people who can benefit from a hearing aid use one. Cost is a big obstacle. Between the device itself and fitting services, Americans can pay more than $5,000 to get a hearing aid. Insurance coverage is very limited, and Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for hearing aids, only diagnostic tests.ADVERTISEMENTU.S. officials said Tuesday that the FDA change, when finalized, should spur competition and bring down prices.

The agency will take public comments on its proposal for 90 days before finalizing the new rules. FDA officials wouldn\u2019t speculate on when new devices would actually hit store shelves.Consumer electronic companies for years have produced lower-cost \u201cpersonal sound amplification\u201d devices, but U.S. regulations bar them from being marketed as hearing aids and they do not undergo FDA review. Regulators said Tuesday that the new rules will make explicit that those devices are not alternatives to FDA-vetted hearing aids. Companies that market them inappropriately could face federal penalties, such as fines or product seizures.For their part, makers of hearing aids have long argued that professional expertise is required to pick the right device and adjust its settings to work properly. Once the FDA rules take effect, traditional manufacturers are expected to begin selling cheaper, direct-to-consumer models. Eventually, advocates predict the hearing aid market will resemble eye care, where consumers can choose between drugstore reading glasses or prescription bifocals.The looser regulations would not apply to devices for people with severe hearing loss or for children. Also, the agency said over-the-counter devices would be required to have volume limits and other measures to help prevent injuries.Companies making over-the-counter hearing aids generally wouldn\u2019t be required to conduct studies in people. Instead, they would submit applications to the FDA showing they met its standards for the devices.Tuesday\u2019s announcement follows prodding from medical committees and Congress, which in 2017 instructed the agency to lay out a plan for over-the-counter hearing devices by August 2020. The agency missed that deadline, in part due to the workload of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, an executive order by President Joe Biden earlier this year set a timetable for the agency to take action no later than mid-November.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

(AP) \u2014 A Montana jury has awarded $16.6 million in damages to a victim of child abuse after a judge ruled the state failed to properly investigate abuse allegations before the 6-month-old girl suffered a traumatic brain injury that led to blindness, developmental delays and seizures. District Court Judge Elizabeth Best in Great Falls found the state was negligent in investigating abuse reported in December 2008, and held the state responsible for the injuries the girl suffered in February 2009. The jury awarded the damages on Nov. 17.\u201cThis is an important moment for our client and represents a measure of justice for her,\u201d Larry Anderson, one of the lawyers for the now 13-year-old girl, said in a statement. \u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict also recognizes the importance of properly investigating child abuse complaints.\u201dThe complaint against the state argued that a Division of Child and Family Services caseworker did not assess whether the girl was safe in the custody of her father and his girlfriend and did not remove her from their home after the December 2008 abuse, leading her to suffer preventable abuse.ADVERTISEMENTAlicia Jo Hocter, the girlfriend of the victim\u2019s father, was sentenced in July 2010 to 30 years in prison without the possibility of parole after being found guilty of aggravated assault and criminal endangerment.Hocter held the infant around the waist and swung her against the edge of a wooden crib two or three times, then tossed the child into the crib, left the room and closed the door, prosecutors said at the time.The jury awarded the girl $6.6 million for future care, $5 million for the loss of her course of life, $4 million for mental and emotional suffering, $713,000 for lost earnings and $336,000 for past care.The girl attends a boarding school for blind and deaf people.When asked if the Department of Public Health and Human Services planned to appeal the award, spokesperson Jon Ebelt said Wednesday that the agency was reviewing the court\u2019s decision.Agency Director Adam Meier seemed to suggest an appeal was possible. \u201cWhile the correctness of the court\u2019s decision remains in dispute, the unspeakable nature of this crime is not,\u201d Meier said Wednesday in a statement to the Great Falls Tribune. \u201cOur hearts go out to the victim of this terrible crime, and the state is safer with the perpetrator incarcerated.

Three House Republicans had balked at a Senate-approved plan to open the voucher program to about 600,000 new low-income students. Instead, they agreed only to shorten waiting periods for the roughly 250,000 children already eligible.ADVERTISEMENTThe voucher dispute highlighted the contentious nature of the 2021 session, in which Republicans had razor-thin majorities in both the House and Senate. Opposition from any any of the 31 Republicans in the House or the 16 in the Senate was enough to kill legislation if no Democrats were on board, creating what Republican Rep. John Kavanagh called \u201c47 governors\u201d with veto power. Despite the narrow margins and the failure on school vouchers, Republicans advanced a staunchly conservative agenda this year that included massive tax cuts focused primarily on the wealthy, new abortion restrictions, limits on sexual education and election law changes. Democrats were frustrated. \u201cThis as been a really trying session,\u201d said Rep. Charlene Fernandez, a Democrat from Yuma. In the final hours of the session on Wednesday, Republicans gave up on the push to expand the voucher program to cover more than half the state\u2019s 1.1 million public school children. Under the agreement, children who already qualify for the program will no longer have to spend 100 days in a public school before receiving a voucher to pay for private-school tuition. Children who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch and live in the boundaries of a poorly rated public school will be eligible immediately, while others will have to spend 45 days in their public school. With the shorter waiting period, \u201cthey don\u2019t have to linger and struggle in the school,\u201d said Sen. Paul Boyer, a Glendale Republican who advocated for the full expansion.\u201cThe school could be a great school, but it might not work for that kid,\u201d Boyer said. The voucher program is open to foster children and those with special needs, living on a Native American reservation or attending a poorly rated school. Children with parents in the military, a blind or deaf parent, or a sibling who gets a voucher also qualify. Boyer had hoped to open the program to all children eligible for free or reduced-price lunch and those receiving Title I services. ADVERTISEMENTRepublicans have called Boyer\u2019s proposal a lifeline for low-income students, while Democrats argue it would siphon money from already underfunded public schools.Just three years ago, Arizona voters by a 2-1 margin rejected a universal school voucher plan passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by Ducey.Children in struggling schools need the Legislature to focus on improving their schools, said Sen. Mart\u00edn Quezada, a Democrat from Glendale. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a parachute or an escape to take them out of their neighborhood,\u201d Quezada said. \u201cThey need us to invest in their neighborhood.\u201dThe state Department of Education says about 250,000 students are now eligible, but only about 9,800 students are currently getting vouchers and half are disabled children attending specialized schools. Technically called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, they cost the state about $145 million a year. Parents get 90% of the state funds that would otherwise go to their local public school to use for private school tuition and other education costs. Disabled students can receive up to $40,000 for specialized therapy.The House and Senate also voted to increase the daily payments given to lawmakers from outside Maricopa County to cover their costs for staying in Phoenix during the legislative session. If Ducey signs off, rural lawmakers\u2019 per diem will be tied to the rate for federal employees traveling on business to Phoenix, currently $207.Currently, Maricopa County lawmakers get $35 a day while rural legislators get $60. The new rates would continue to drop after 120 days of session, as they do now. Supporters of the increase said the current rates, which were last changed in 1984, fall far short of the cost to maintain safe housing in Phoenix. Several critics said the Legislature shouldn\u2019t be rushing through such a change on the last day of the legislative session. Ducey vetoed similar legislation two years ago that would have also boosted payments to legislators who live locally. At 171 days, the 2021 session was tied for the third longest since the modern 90-member legislature was established in 1965, according to an almanac maintained by the Arizona Capitol Times."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/health-state-budgets-business-government-and-politics-coronavirus-21deec0f4a0b63544c3f2c7433f2bebf", "headline": "Indiana budget deal boosts school funding, construction | AP News", "date": "2021-04-20T22:46:17Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 A new Indiana state budget awash in federal coronavirus relief money will give a sizeable funding boost to public schools while also paying for numerous economic grant programs and construction projects.The state budget deal announced Tuesday by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders will increase school funding by about 4.5% each of the next two years. That is more than double what budget writers proposed earlier this month before new projections showed state tax collections should bounce back stronger than expected from the pandemic recession.Legislative leaders said the budget plan will cover the $600 million a year in additional money the governor\u2019s teacher compensation commission found was needed to significantly boost Indiana\u2019s lagging teacher pay in comparison to nearby states. The bill directs school districts to submit explanations to the state if they aren\u2019t able to set a minimum teacher pay of $40,000 a year. \u201cWe\u2019re making a significant investment,\u201d Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said. \u201cWe expect it to be in teacher pay and we\u2019ll be watching closely. It feels like a lot of the pressure on teacher pay has been directed to this building. We\u2019ve stepped up, now it\u2019s time for locals to step up.\u201dThe deal includes a contentious expansion of the state\u2019s private school voucher program by raising income eligibility for a family of four from the current roughly $96,000 a year to about $145,000 for the coming school year, potentially boosting participation by one-third to about 48,000 students.Public schools officials and teachers unions have opposed that expansion, arguing that its projected cost of at least $125 million over two years would consume too much of the K-12 education funding increase.But the $3 billion infusion of federal relief funding and a projected $2 billion more than previously expected in state tax collections over the next two years seems to have let Republican leaders go ahead with the voucher expansion and giving $13 million toward a new program allowing parents to directly spend state money on their child\u2019s education expenses.\u201cWe\u2019re able to get where we needed to be with the public education dollars and that helped to open up this conversation for the vouchers,\u201d Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said. \u201cWe think we feel like we\u2019ve found ourselves in a pretty good place.\u201dThe Republican-dominated House and Senate could vote as soon as Wednesday on approving the budget deal and wrapping up this year\u2019s regular legislative session.Legislative Democrats said they were encouraged by the boost in education funding but emphasized the amount of money coming to the state from the federal relief plan backed by President Joe Biden and pushed by Democrats through Congress without Republican support.\u201cThere\u2019s still some trepidation and some hesitation because we have concerns with the expansion of vouchers,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Eddie Melton of Gary. \u201cThis is still siphoning funds away from our traditional K through 12 public schools.\u201dThe projected school funding increases of 4.6% in the budget\u2019s first year and 4.3% in the second \u2014 for a total additional $1 billion \u2014 follows a decade of Republican-written state budgets that raised school funding by an average of 1.5%, drawing criticism about school spending not even keeping up with inflation.The Republican plan spends about $1 billion in paying off state debts early, while anticipating that the state\u2019s cash reserves will grow some $500 million to about $2.75 billion by July 2023.Other provisions in the budget partially direct the spending of federal relief funding. That includes $500 million toward a regional economic development grants program, $250 million for broadband internet expansion grants and $500 million into the state\u2019s unemployment insurance trust fund that was drained by the explosion in jobless benefit payments during the past year.Federal funding is also being used for a $550 million fund for possible state construction projects, including a new state archives building, a new campus for the state\u2019s blind and deaf schools, new inns at the Potato Creek and Prophetstown state parks and a new state police post and laboratory in Evansville.The plan sets aside $900 million of federal money for future state construction projects, along with $60 million for the state\u2019s recreational trails construction program.Other big-ticket items include $400 million for reconstruction of the Westville prison in northwestern Indiana and $50 million to replace the swine barn at the Indiana State Fairgrounds with an enclosed building for year-round events."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-alabama-helen-keller-bd26e41cbff8c0d9a1b22e161191f990", "headline": "New documentary examines life of Alabama native Helen Keller | AP ...", "date": "2021-10-16T16:44:15Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "MONTGOMERY, Ala.

And it\u2019s not entirely unfounded advice: 61 actors have been nominated for playing a character with a disability and 27 have walked away winners. But only two of those actors actually had a disability \u2014 Marlee Matlin in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d and Harold Russell in \u201cThe Best Years of Our Lives.\u201dThat\u2019s just one of the things that needs to change, according to a group of entertainment industry professionals with disabilities including actors Danny Woodburn, \u201cA Quiet Place\u2019s\u201d Millicent Simmonds and \u201cPeanut Butter Falcon\u2019s\u201d Zack Gottsagen. They and other creatives with disabilities, from directors to VFX artists, spoke about the state of representation in front of and behind the camera in series of virtual panels organized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that debuted Monday night. The panels, funded in part by a grant from the Ruderman Family Foundation, coincides with the 30th anniversary year of the Americans with Disabilities Act.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cIt would be really helpful to have a disabled (Disney) princess,\u201d said actor and comedian Maysoon Zayid, who has cerebral palsy.Zayid noted that people with visible and invisible disabilities make up about 20% of the American population but a miniscule number of characters on television and in film. \u201cThe message being sent out to disabled kids is you do not belong in this world,\u201d Zayid said. \u201cPeople with disabilities face enormous amounts of bullying, violence and discrimination. Positive images of disability can stop that.\u201dPart of that is casting actors with disabilities to play characters with disabilities. Simmonds, who is deaf, said she\u2019s had to go up against non-disabled actors for disabled roles. She recalled that her \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d director John Krasinski had to fight to cast a deaf actor and that producers wanted someone who was hearing. \u201cDeaf roles should be played by deaf actors,\u201d she said through an interpreter. At times she\u2019s even taken it a step forward to advocate for herself.\u201cI\u2019m not above calling directors or producers and suggesting that they have a deaf actress for a particular role,\u201d she said.But another part of the equation is giving actors rich and nuanced storylines that go beyond the three they usually get: \u201c\u2018You can\u2019t love me because I\u2019m disabled,\u2019 \u2018heal me\u2019 or \u2018kill me,\u2019\u201d said Zayid.Woodburn, who has dwarfism, remembers watching actors like Michael Dunn when he was young and seeing only stereotypes and tropes like the \u201csad little man\u201d or the \u201cdevious little man\u201d and storylines that were the same.ADVERTISEMENTThere is also the issue of working and how productions can be more accommodating to people with disabilities both on screen and behind the scenes. Many noted that they don\u2019t want to ask for special accommodations. Zayid remembered being unable to get into her trailer on the set of \u201cYou Don\u2019t Mess with the Zohan\u201d and basically had to ask a production assistant to help hoist her up. \u201cAdam Sandler saw and said, \u2018What is happening? Make her trailer accessible!\u201d I said I didn\u2019t want to be high maintenance,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said \u2018look around, we\u2019re in Hollywood.\u2019\u201dJim LeBrecht, who directed the Netflix documentary \u201cCrip Camp,\u201d said it could help if the industry re-thought its own barriers to entry, like starting as a production assistant who has to carry 14 cups of coffee and work 20 hour days to get a foot in the door. \u201cInstead of asking what you won\u2019t be able to do, ask is there anything I can do to help you do the best work you can,\u201d LeBrecht said. \u201cNone of us got to your door by being oversensitive and mad at everybody...we are comfortable with our disability.\u201dVFX supervisor Kaitlyn Yang said that people with disabilities can be particularly effective in post-production roles. She\u2019s also found a silver-lining in the video conferencing realities of COVID-era filmmaking: She doesn\u2019t have to wonder now if she should address her wheelchair.\u201cVideo conferencing is taking away the uncomfortableness that people might have if I were to take a meeting and roll into the conference room,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIt puts us on an equal playing field.\u201d Talent manager Eryn Brown hopes that disability representation reach the same level of discussion as LGBTQ and racial and ethnic diversity. She said the ingrained stigma around it has even made her reticent to discuss it with her clients. \u201cA raised awareness in this moment of cultural reckoning is imperative,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnyone at any moment can become disabled so it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interests in the world to be accommodating.\u201dThe film academy, which puts on the Oscars, has been working to increase diversity in its own ranks and in the industry and recently set inclusion standards for best picture nominees. \u201cAs the Academy continues to examine longstanding issues of representation within the film industry, it\u2019s imperative we bring conversations about disabilities to the forefront,\u201d said Christine Simmons, who heads the Academy\u2019s office of representation, inclusion and equity.___Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr "}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/west-bank-shootings-israel-middle-east-jerusalem-741785e29286e113faaffb3a87ae3cd5", "headline": "Israeli forces shoot, wound deaf Palestinian at checkpoint | AP News", "date": "2020-08-17T19:55:49Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli security guards on Monday shot and wounded a Palestinian who is deaf and couldn\u2019t hear their commands to stop at a West Bank checkpoint, police said, while a suspected Palestinian attacker was shot and killed in a separate incident in Jerusalem.Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the 60-year-old man was walking in an area of the Qalandia Crossing north of Jerusalem where only vehicles are permitted. Rosenfeld said security guards called upon the man to stop but he continued to \u201capproach them suspiciously.\u201d They then opened fire toward his legs, moderately wounding him.

(AP) \u2014 Federal litigators reached a civil settlement Tuesday with the largest operator of group homes in Virginia for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities over allegations it failed to provide necessary sign language interpreters.U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia G. Zachary Terwilliger announced the settlement with Richmond-based Good Neighbor Homes Inc.The settlement resolves allegations that the company violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to provide an interpreter for a deaf resident. The complaint alleged that interpreters were missing even during important meetings including discussions about investigation of an accident in which the woman was seriously injured.ADVERTISEMENTThe complaint alleged that the resident\u2019s sister was often forced to step in to provide communication assistance. Court papers indicate the woman lived at a Good Neighbor group home in Goochland County near Richmond from 2014 to 2017.Terwilliger said the resident suffered from multiple disabilities in addition to being deaf, including cerebral palsy, and that service providers must be prepared to handle all necessary aspects of care.Good Neighbor, which runs more than 50 group homes across the state, agreed to pay $225,000 to the resident, $40,000 to the sister and a $50,000 civil penalty.Charles James, a lawyer for Good Neighbor, said in a statement Tuesday that compliance with the ADA is a priority for the company.\u201cGood Neighbor is glad to have resolved any misunderstanding of our former resident\u2019s communication needs and preferences,\u201d James said. Terwilliger also announced he\u2019s creating a Civil Rights Enforcement Unit in his office that will be dedicated to such cases. He said it will be the only unit among the 93 U.S. Attorney offices nationwide with multiple lawyers committed to such a unit.The Eastern District of Virginia is best known for national security cases involving terrorism and espionage, but Terwilliger said the office has long had a strong civil rights component. Still, he said, \u201cthe needs of the disability community far outpaces the resources of our office.\u201dGoing forward, the office will have three full-time assistant U.S. attorneys who will focus on civil rights cases involving the Americans with Disabilities Act and two federal laws protecting the rights of veterans and servicemembers.Terwilliger said he has been working for more than two years to find the funding to expand the office\u2019s capability on civil rights cases. He said the issue is personal for him, as a diagnosed dyslexic who thrived because he had skilled special education teachers who helped him develop learning strategies to overcome his disability."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/riz-ahmed-sound-of-metal-film-90d4ede08697198920fedd3f6733f26c", "headline": "In 'Sound of Metal,' a groundbreaking portrait of deafness | AP News", "date": "2020-11-23T14:13:30Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "What should deafness sound like on film?

ADVERTISEMENT\u201cSound of Metal,\u201d now playing in limited release before it debuts on Amazon Prime Video on Dec. 4, not only delivers on that lofty goal but also features one of the best performances of the year from actor Riz Ahmed who was tasked with the challenge of bringing Ruben to life.Marder, who co-wrote \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines\u201d had spent years trying to \u201cscare the crap out of\u201d actors with the prospect of playing Ruben. It was important, too, that the actor be hearing since, he said Ruben starts out that way. Then he met Ahmed, the 37-year-old British actor of Pakistani decent known for the HBO miniseries \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d for which he got an Emmy nomination, and films like \u201cNightcrawler,\u201d \u201cRogue One\u201d and \u201cVenom,\u201d and he knew he found the right actor for what he was asking.\u201cHe is a great talent and a great intellect, but I didn\u2019t know what was behind that,\u201d Marder said. \u201cWhat I found was someone who was appropriately frightened, which is always a good sign, but also just intoxicatingly interested in being frightened and taking on that challenge.\u201d Ahmed would have to really play the drums, learn American Sign Language (ASL) and essentially push himself to the limits playing this ex-heroin addict who with his hearing loss fears that he may lose everything: His livelihood, his girlfriend and bandmate (Olivia Cooke) and his identity.\u201cWe wanted to do something that was all in,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cWe just wanted to really connect to how overwhelming and invigorating and terrifying it can be to kind of throw yourself into the deep end of a creative endeavor.\u201dTo make matters even more complicated, Marder decided to shoot on 35mm film, which meant that takes would be limited. But even that was exciting for Ahmed.\u201cI liked the idea of spending seven months learning the drums and sign language and then doing a four week shoot where you only get two takes of anything because we\u2019re shooting on film,\u201d Ahmed said. ADVERTISEMENTOn set, Ahmed wore custom implants in his ears that emitted white noise and a high ringing to approximate tinnitus. He couldn\u2019t even hear his own voice. On those days communicated with Marder on little bits of paper. In the final mix, a lot of the sounds you hear in the movie are, as Marder puts it, \u201cthe inside of Riz.\u201d They recorded in his mouth, his throat and even his eyelids. For his part, Ahmed spent time with members of the deaf community in New York and got quite close with his sign instructor, who helped him navigate the new culture. He explained that as a late-deafened person, Ruben goes through stages where he thinks of his hearing loss as \u201ca loss, a lack, a disability.\u201d Later, during his stay in a sober, deaf community, he starts to realize it is a culture and a way of being, Ahmed said.Full Coverage:\u00a0EntertainmentRepresentation of disability in film is a complex topic and actors with disabilities continue to lobby for authentic portrayals. And just as Marder knew that he needed a hearing actor to embody Ruben\u2019s journey, he also knew he wanted actors from deaf culture to populate the rehab facility, including the very significant part of Joe, the Vietnam veteran who runs the center. Marder was encouraged to consider A-list actors, all of whom were hearing, for the meaty part, but he didn\u2019t relent. \u201cThat was something I fought very hard for,\u201d Marder said. \u201cAnd it was a much harder fight than it should have been.\u201d He ended up finding actor Paul Raci, a Vietnam veteran himself and a child of deaf adults. The film is also open captioned in English to make it more accessible for all audiences, except in scenes with ASL. \u201cWe have to experience what Ruben experiences,\u201d Marder said. \u201cHe has to contend with being a minority and not being comfortable in a culture that isn\u2019t his. And so do we as an audience.\u201dAhmed found it to be a transformative experience. \u201cI really hope that when people watch the film, it kind of stays with them and maybe changes them a little bit as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a film about reevaluating who you think you really are and realizing the things you think define us are not all we are.\u201d\u2014-Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr "}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sound-of-metal-movie-review-riz-ahmed-1bfc9781c523bee9f387cc885fa0d9dd", "headline": "Review: A punk drummer's life upended in 'Sound of Metal' | AP News", "date": "2020-11-17T20:26:21Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "The film \u201cSound of Metal\u201d starts with the uncomfortably loud noises of guitar feedback and ends two hours later with absolute silence.

The film has been subtitled so it can be experienced by both the hearing and deaf communities. At the rehab facility, our drummer goes through the difficult process of rebuilding his life. Without a language in the deaf world, he is doubly lost. He learns American Sign Language with deaf elementary school kids and becomes a sort of big brother to them.

They were among the victims of violent sexual abuse by priests in the Argentine branch of the Provolo Institute, a Catholic-run school for the deaf that also saw dozens of victims at its school in Verona, Italy.Recently, an Argentine court convicted two Provolo priests of repeatedly violating the children \u2014 including one who also was flagged to Francis as early as in 2014 as an abuser in Verona. \u201cSupport the Provolo survivors,\u201d read a banner carried by the victims in front of St. Peter\u2019s Square. ADVERTISEMENTAlso marching was Mary Dispenza, a survivor of abuse by both a priest and a nun. She and members of the U.S.-based victims\u2019 advocacy group SNAP walked to the headquarters of the umbrella group of religious sisters and secured a meeting with its executive secretary, Sister Patricia Murray.Their aim was to request that the organization, UISG, speak out more about the unacknowledged problem of nuns who sexually abuse children and other nuns. Much of the abuse crisis has focused on priests raping and molesting children. Little has been said or done about the problem of abuses committed by nuns.\u201cDid we accomplish anything? I\u2019m not sure. Sister Patricia was genuine in her concern,\u201d Dispenza told The Associated Press in an email.This week\u2019s activism has been sparked by the one-year anniversary of Francis\u2019 Feb. 21-24, 2019 summit, during which he convened the heads of national bishops\u2019 conferences from around the world for a four-day tutorial on preventing sexual abuse.He called the summit after he himself misjudged the scope of the scandal, especially in Chile, and after the scandal re-ignited in the U.S. following revelations of decades of systemic cover-up in Pennsylvania and the case of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Francis defrocked the U.S. church leader for abusing adults and children.In the year since the summit, Francis has passed two major legal reforms: He has removed the so-called pontifical secret from sex abuse cases, meaning bishops and religious superiors now can cooperate more freely with law enforcement during criminal investigations of abusers. And he passed a law requiring all abuse be reported to the church \u2014 but not police \u2014 including abuse committed by nuns.ADVERTISEMENTAt a press conference this week, experts from BishopAccountability, an online database of the abuse crisis, praised the legal developments and the awareness that the global summit brought to church leaders who have long refused to believe victims.

The task is especially difficult for those working with students who are deaf, hard of hearing or whose first language is not English. \u201cFor one, the mask might muffle some sounds, making it harder for English learners to distinguish them, such as the sound for \u2018P\u2019 and the sound for \u2018B,\u2019\u201d said Deborah Short, president of the TESOL International Association. The Virginia-based group was created to unite teachers and administrators with an interest in teaching English to speakers of other languages. ADVERTISEMENT\u201cA mask stops students from watching how a teacher forms sounds, how the lips and tongue are positioned and whether air is expelled or not,\u201d she said.Short said teachers can mitigate those limitations by speaking loudly and articulating well. They also can utilize videos and images to \u201cshow how sounds may be created,\u201d she said.Some schools have ordered face shields or masks with windows so students can see teachers\u2019 mouths, although some have raised concerns about the plastic screens fogging up. Wanzer said one colleague wore such a mask to work with a hearing impaired student who said it made the teacher look like the Joker and was unnecessary. The teacher was happy not to use it, she said, because the plastic material was so uncomfortable.Nonetheless, teachers and schools have driven spikes in demand for clear masks from companies like Baltimore-based ClearMask, which began producing its namesake product in 2017 after its co-founder, who is deaf, was unable to communicate effectively while undergoing surgery while wearing a traditional mask. The company\u2019s manufacturing team has grown from four employees to more than 250 since the start of the pandemic. \u201cWe see a large need for early childhood education to support young children\u2019s social, emotional, and language development, as well as specific programs for students,\u201d said ClearMask co-founder and president Allysa Dittmar. At the C.B. Jennings International Elementary Magnet School in New London, Connecticut, teachers are provided with carts with plexiglass that they can stand behind as they move around the classroom. Even behind them, many teachers still keep their masks on, according to instructional coach Elizabeth Sked, who said expressive eyes go a long way to connecting with students.\u201cKids and teachers are super resilient,\u201d she said. Belinda Williams, a kindergarten teacher at Webb Elementary School in Franklin, Indiana, said she and her students have adapted to wearing masks, along with a new routines for hand-sanitizing and social distancing.

Edwards said he renewed them through Jan. 13, announcing the decision as Louisiana reached its highest number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients since April. ADVERTISEMENT\u201cIt remains a very perilous situation for the state with respect to COVID,\u201d Edwards said. He added: \u201cIf we insist on traveling and having those holiday-related activities and gatherings like we normally would, then we\u2019re obviously going to be in even more trouble.\u201dThe decision to maintain restrictions wasn\u2019t a surprise. Edwards already had said he wouldn\u2019t loosen the limits, which include a statewide mask mandate. The only question going into Tuesday\u2019s announcement had been whether he would tighten them further, which he decided against.While the start of vaccinations has offered hope of an end to the pandemic, it remains months before widespread immunizations will be available. At least 22,000 people in Louisiana \u2014 hospital workers and EMS employees \u2014 have received their first of two vaccinations so far, according to new tracking information released on the state health department\u2019s website Tuesday.Vaccinations for people who live and work at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are set to begin in Louisiana next week. Edwards said he hasn\u2019t decided who will be next in line for shots after those groups. He\u2019s sifting through the latest recommendations from a panel of scientific experts that advises the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those suggestions called for states to next prioritize people 75 and older and essential workers such as firefighters, teachers and grocery workers. The governor said he expects Louisiana to largely follow that proposal. If the state makes adjustments, Edwards said, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be on the margins. So, our priorities will not look markedly different.\u201dUnder Edwards\u2019 continuing Phase 2 rules, restaurants, gyms, salons, casinos, malls and other nonessential businesses will have to continue limiting customer numbers to 50% of their occupancy rate. Crowds at churches will stay restricted to 75% of occupancy including for Christmas services. Most bars likely will remain limited to takeout, delivery and outside seating, because their parishes don\u2019t meet the low percentages of coronavirus tests returning positive required to allow indoor drinking at bars. Indoor gatherings for weddings and events will continue to be limited to 75 people or a maximum of 25% occupancy, whichever is less. Outdoor gatherings have looser limits. Louisiana is in its third spike of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths since the state\u2019s outbreak began in mid-March. ADVERTISEMENTThe health department said Tuesday that 1,647 people are hospitalized with the COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus, higher than the hospitalization numbers of Louisiana\u2019s summer surge. Public health leaders are concerned the facilities could soon be overwhelmed if the virus\u2019 spread worsens because of holiday gatherings.\u201cThere is more COVID circulating now in the state than there ever has been before,\u201d said Dr. Joe Kanter, the governor\u2019s chief public health adviser.The state is averaging more than 2,000 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus daily over the last week. At least 6,813 people are confirmed to have died from COVID-19 in the state, according to health department data.The governor\u2019s restrictions are being challenged in court by House Republicans, who sought to nullify a previous version of the rules. A district judge had ruled the process used by the GOP lawmakers unconstitutional, but the Louisiana Supreme Court overturned that decision on a procedural issue and sent the case back to the lower court judge for a new hearing.___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.

You have to be mentally tough. \u201cAll those things combined, I think we can hopefully turn this thing around, and we can hit the plays that are there to be had.\u201dTomlin hinted at having his players put on the pads this week in an effort to bring a sense of urgency that has been lacking of late. It can be a delicate balance, particularly in mid-December, particularly for a team that isn\u2019t exactly young up front on either side of the ball. Three offensive line starters are in their 30s. So are two of the three starting defensive linemen. The mileage starts to add up this time of year.Longtime defensive captain Cam Heyward\u2019s solution: practice like you want to play. That means going all out in non-contact drills in hopes of emulating what awaits in the stadium.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cI think we have to be more cognizant of that and we have to attack those reps, if our individuals are cut short, make sure your individuals are 100 mph,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to take advantage of those moments because we\u2019re not getting those back. ... It\u2019s up to us to execute at a high level.\u201dSomething Pittsburgh hasn\u2019t done much of recently. The signs of slippage were there far before their 11-0 run to start the season ended with an upset loss to Washington at home on Dec. 7.They slogged through a victory in Dallas in which they needed to rally in the second half against Cowboys fourth-string quarterback Garrett Gilbert. They weren\u2019t exactly sharp while beating lowly Jacksonville, trailing early and not really putting the Jaguars away until the fourth quarter. Their thrice-delayed showdown with the COVID-19 depleted Ravens was so uninspiring Tomlin lashed out at them for \u201csucking.\u201dAmid all the unease, the Steelers can still clinch the AFC North title with a victory next Monday against lowly Cincinnati. They also have time to get it together before the playoffs start. They\u2019ll have to do it, however, with an offensive line that lost left guard Matt Feiler to a season-ending pectoral injury against Buffalo. Backup Kevin Dotson is dealing with a shoulder issue and right tackle Chukwuma Okorafor has an ankle problem.That\u2019s why Roethlisberger stressed getting back to some semblance of \u201cThe Steeler Way\u201d isn\u2019t solely reliant on the guys up front.\u201cAs runners, sometimes there\u2019s a guy in the hole, an unblocked guy. You have to put your head down and get the tough 1 or 2 yards,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes receivers have to put their head down instead of stepping out of bounds and get those tough kind of yards. It\u2019s not everybody, but collectively, we all need to be more physical.\u201dIt\u2019s something wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster has done since he entered the league in 2017, when he famously laid out former Cincinnati linebacker Vontaze Burfict with a blindside (and ultimately illegal) hit  later made into a T-shirt sold near the entrance to Heinz Field. Smith-Schuster tried to give his team a lift against Buffalo when he lowered his shoulder and collided with Bills linebacker Tremaine Edmunds on a drive that ended with a third-quarter touchdown.\u201cI can tell my receivers, \u2018Let\u2019s be physical,\u2019 but at the end of the day I have to go and show them,\u201d Smith-Schuster said. An example Smith-Schuster\u2019s teammates know they have to follow in the coming weeks if Pittsburgh wants to prevent its current lull from becoming something far more catastrophic to its season.NOTES: Smith-Schuster has no plans to drop his pregame ritual of dancing on the midfield logo. He began the ritual earlier in the season, much to the delight of his significant social-media following. The Bills viewed it as a sign of disrespect and said as much afterward. Not that Smith-Schuster seems to care. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop doing it,\u201d he said. ___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL "}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/africa-indictments-california-archive-san-diego-84aa95252a5be273842f60517dff4a35", "headline": "Military contractor charged with fraud on Africa contracts | AP News", "date": "2020-10-14T03:04:06Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 A U.S. military contractor has been indicted in California for allegedly faking quality control on construction projects in Africa that were so badly done some buildings collapsed, including an aircraft hangar, authorities said Tuesday.Micheline Pollock was named in a 98-count indictment by a federal grand jury in San Diego, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for Southern California said in a statement.Pollock was chief executive officer of Dover Vantage, which between 2011 and 2018 won contracts from the Army Corps of Engineers and Navy Facilities Engineering Command for military and humanitarian projects in Africa.

Tony Evers changes course, issues statewide mask mandate ...", "date": "2020-07-30T19:38:35Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "In an abrupt about-face, Gov. Tony Evers on Thursday issued a statewide order requiring the majority of Wisconsinites to wear a face mask when inside most buildings.The public health emergency order, which goes into effect on Saturday, follows weeks of public statements by Evers that such a mandate was unlikely in Wisconsin. It also sets up another likely battle between the Democratic governor and state GOP leaders, who successfully sued to strike down Evers\u2019 \u201csafer-at-home\u201d order in May. Republican leaders already have signaled opposition to the notion of a statewide mask order.ADVERTISEMENTIn a pair of executive orders Thursday, Evers again declared a public health emergency -- his second this year aimed at combating the COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 50,000 Wisconsinites and killed more than 900 people -- and issued a separate emergency order requiring masks. His first original order expired in May.\u201cWhile our local health departments have been doing a heck of a job responding to this pandemic in our communities, the fact of the matter is, this virus doesn\u2019t care about any town, city, or county boundary, and we need a statewide approach to get Wisconsin back on track,\u201d Evers said in a statement. \u201cWhile I know emotions are high when it comes to wearing face coverings in public, my job as governor is to put people first and to do what\u2019s best for the people of our state, so that\u2019s what I am going to do.\u201dUnder the new order, which expires September 28, everyone age 5 and older must wear a face covering when indoors or in any enclosed space open to the public including bars, outdoor restaurants, public transit and outdoor park structures. The order does not apply to people in their private residences. Face coverings are strongly recommended in all other settings, including outdoors when maintaining physical distance is not possible. A violation of the order would not bring any criminal penalties, but could result in a $200 fine.\nMomentum building among Wisconsin Democrats calling for statewide mask order\nThe order provides some exceptions to the face mask mandate, allowing them to be removed when eating or drinking or when communicating with an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing, according to the order. In a preamble, the order calls on Wisconsinites not to harass or threaten people who wear a mask while \u201cshowing patience and compassion for those who are unable to wear a face covering safely.\u201dADVERTISEMENTThe state order also supersedes any less-restrictive local mask order but does allow local entities to enforce more restrictive mask rules.The Evers\u2019 administration\u2019s \u201cSafer at Home\u201d order was issued by Evers\u2019 health secretary and the state Supreme Court struck it down on procedural grounds, saying the Legislature needed to have a say in any longterm COVID-19 regulations.Thursday\u2019s mask requirement was handed down by Evers\u2019 himself, and rests on a separate authority. The Legislature has the ability to immediately rescind the order through a joint resolution passed by the Senate and Assembly, so it\u2019s unclear whether the state\u2019s courts will be asked to intervene.Already, Sen. Steve Nass, R-Whitewater, called on the Legislature to rescind the statewide mask requirement, but Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, haven\u2019t weighed in.GOP leaders have expressed support for local mask rules like those adopted in Dane County, Milwaukee, Green Bay and Racine. The Republican-controlled Legislature also has the authority to pass a state mask order, but Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, have said they are not interested in a statewide mandate.\u201cI think wearing a mask should be voluntary and many people are already doing it,\u201d Fitzgerald told the Associated Press.Vos said in a Thursday statement he was opposed to a \u201cone-size-fits-all mandate.\u201d\u201cThere are certainly constitutional questions here; I would expect legal challenges from citizen groups,\u201d Vos said. He came short of indicating if Republicans plan on challenging the order in court.\nTony Evers says case growing for state mask mandate as COVID-19 infections climb\nOver a 14 day period from July 13 to Monday, Dane county had an average of 63 cases a day \u2014 an improvement from a month ago when the county\u2019s 14-day average was 98 cases per day. But Director of Public Health Madison and Dane County Janel Heinrich said the case numbers are still too high.\u201cWe continue to find that many individuals with positive diagnoses continue to report that they have attended a gathering or party with people outside of their household,\u201d Heinrich said.Current orders in Dane county limit indoor gathering to 10 people and outside gatherings to 25 people.More than 30 states \u2014 including Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota \u2014 have implemented statewide mask orders in efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19.While Evers said last week the growing number of positive cases of COVID-19 in Wisconsin had \u201caccelerated\u201d his consideration of a mask mandate, the governor has said multiple times that his authority to impose a statewide order is likely limited by the state Supreme Court\u2019s May decision to toss out his stay-at-home order.The court\u2019s ruling focused on Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm\u2019s extension of the Evers administration\u2019s \u201csafer at home\u201d order, which closed nonessential businesses and limited services at others. The court ruled Palm exceeded the authority granted to her by state law when she extended the rule without legislative oversight.\u201cAs a legal matter, it does not directly prohibit the governor from acting,\u201d Jeffrey Mandell, a liberal Madison attorney who has worked for Evers, told the State Journal. \u201cI think it would be overly simplistic for anyone to say, \u2018Legislature v. Palm entirely decided the authority that Gov. Evers has with respect to COVID-19, that\u2019s over and done with.\u2019\u201d\nWisconsin hits coronavirus record as cases in Dane County, Milwaukee dwindle\nGuidance on mask-wearing from public health experts has at times been confusing.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a cloth face mask in public settings in areas with significant community-based transmission where social distancing is hard to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies or a busy street. The CDC also recommended public mask-wearing after studies showed that COVID-19 can be spread by people showing no symptoms.Various studies have shown that mask mandates have led to slowdowns of new COVID-19 infections and that masks have the ability to block respiratory droplets that could potentially spread the virus.Research on the effectiveness of wearing face masks is limited, but the idea is that wearing a mask helps reduce the transmission of the virus from the wearer to people in proximity through talking, coughing or sneezing. Dr. James Conway, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, said cloth masks can achieve that quite well.Opponents of a face mask requirement, including dozens of people who gathered at the state Capitol last week, have said wearing a mask should be a personal choice and mask mandates are an encroachment upon civil liberties.State Journal reporter Emily Hamer contributed to this report.COVID-19 in photos: How Wisconsin is managing the pandemic\nCOVID-19 in photos: How Wisconsin is managing the pandemic\n"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/rhode-island-providence-shootings-5dd1283c9f7a03304a90ccea68a6a2ae", "headline": "Police release names of victims in triple shooting | AP News", "date": "2020-10-15T13:28:52Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "PROVIDENCE, R.I.

The restaurant trains disabled employees to prep food and cook, as well as serve customers.\u201cIt\u2019s important to help the disabled or the disadvantaged people, because they are at society\u2019s bottom of the pyramid,\u201d said the restaurant\u2019s founder, Koh Seng Choon, a sprightly 61-year-old Singaporean entrepreneur who launched the restaurant in January.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThey are the people who need help.

Thirty-four of the new cases came from the Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of the country\u2019s 51 million people live, and 10 were tied to international arrivals.Monday\u2019s daily jump was the lowest since 34 new cases were reported on Aug. 11. The country reported around 200 to 300 cases a day from mid-August to early September, a resurgence that forced officials to tighten social distancing restrictions in the Seoul area and elsewhere.Officials have called for vigilance ahead of the Chuseok harvest festival that begins Wednesday and continues through the weekend. Thye are pleading for people to stay home during an annual holiday when South Koreans typically travel to visit relatives, and nightclubs, bars and other establishments deemed \u201chigh-risk\u201d will be shut in Seoul during the holiday period to reduce gatherings.___NEW YORK -- Jewish communities across the U.S. are celebrating the holiest day on their calendar within the limitations of the coronavirus, with virtual services and in-person worship with restrictions. Chabad-Lubavitch organized a worldwide pre-Yom Kippur Yizkor event to allow lost family members to be remembered, including a memorial for 1,200 Jewish victims of COVID-19 who are listed on the Chabad.org memorial page. Temple Emanu-El, a reform congregation in New York City, planned a wide range of virtual services for Sunday and Monday. Rabbi Joshua M. Davidson said in a statement that they were providing online services to remind the community \u201cthat we can connect to our faith and protect each other and our health at the same time.\u201d He said, \u201cNo one should feel alone on Yom Kippur.\u201d In addition to virtual services, the temple planned to host limited in-person services for Kol Nidre, a Jewish prayer that signals the start of Yom Kippur. That service is open to members who are frontline workers and medical personnel, as well as those who lost a family member in the past year.Pre-registration was required, as well as adherence to social distancing and masks.___MADRID \u2014 An association of families of coronavirus victims has planted what it says are 53,000 small Spanish flags in a Madrid park to honor the dead of the pandemic.Volunteers placed the flags on a grassy slope overlooking a highway in the capital early on Sunday.COVID-19 has claimed a confirmed 31,232 lives in Spain. But difficulties in testing at the start of the crisis mean many more victims likely have gone unrecorded.\u201cI think it is a beautiful homage to the victims, a lot better than the homage that was given by the prime minister,\u201d 62-year-old retiree Honorio Hernandez said. \u201cI have been in the Arlington National Cemetery and this reminds me of that. These people at the very least deserve this, if not much more.\u201dElsewhere in Madrid, over 1,000 protesters rallied to demand a more vigorous response to the growing second wave of the coronavirus.Madrid has become the epicenter of the rebound of the virus in Spain, once again the worst hit country in Europe. Spain has 319 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over 14 days. France has 229 cases per 100,000, the United Kingdom 96.___ROME \u2014 Italy reported another 1,766 coronavirus cases on Sunday, in line with its recent daily increases, but with a smaller number of tests conducted in the past 24 hours. Another 17 people died, bringing Italy\u2019s official death toll to 35,835, the highest in Europe after Britain.Every Italian region reported new cases on Sunday, with the exception of the small Valle d\u2019Aosta region.The southern Campania was the region with the highest daily number of infections, at 245, while the hard-hit Lombardy, once the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe, reported 216 new cases.While hospitalizations and intensive care admissions are slightly rising, Italy has so far managed to keep its infections per 100,000 people far lower than France, Spain or Britain, which earlier this week were forced to impose new restrictions to avoid a second pandemic wave. Italy, which usually processes around 100,000 tests per day, in the past 24 hours conducted only 87,714 tests.___TALLAHASSEE, Floria \u2014 Florida now has more than 700,000 confirmed infections of the new coronavirus, according to statistics released by the state Department of Health Sunday.The state reported 1,882 new confirmed cases and 10 new deaths caused by the virus.

Several countries around us made other choices. We don\u2019t want this.\u201dFrench health authorities reported 14,000 new infections Saturday amid a mass testing effort. France has reported 31,700 virus-related deaths, the third-highest toll in Europe after Britain and Italy.While at least 10% of French intensive care beds are now occupied with COVID patients, Veran said they\u2019re far from saturation.Still, he said hospitals in the Paris and Marseille regions are delaying scheduled surgeries to free up space. Hospitals temporarily suspended such operations when the virus swept over France in March and April, creating backlogs that still persist six months later.___LONDON \u2014 Prince Charles has warned that up to 1 million young people may need \u201curgent help\u201d to protect their futures from the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Prince of Wales says there has \u201cnever been a time as uniquely challenging as the present\u201d and that it is a particularly hard time to be young.He says the crisis is reminiscent of the upheavals of the 1970s, when youth unemployment was one of the pressing issues facing British society.He says, \u201cthe task ahead is unquestionably vast, but it is not insurmountable.\u201dCharles\u2019 comments come as university students \u2014 many of whom have only just arrived on campuses after the summer break \u2014 are facing increased restrictions amid COVID-19 outbreaks in residence halls.In Manchester, students are chafing at a lockdown they say was imposed without warning. One group taped \u201cHMP MMU\u201d to a window, suggesting the dormitory had become Her Majesty\u2019s Prison at Manchester Metropolitan University.___NEW DELHI \u2014 India has registered 88,600 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours in a declining trend with recoveries exceeding daily infections.The Health Ministry on Sunday also reported additional 1,124 deaths for a total of 94,503. The average of new cases has fallen by around 7,000 daily in the past week after reaching a record number of 97,894 on Sept. 16.Still, India is expected to become the pandemic\u2019s worst-hit country within weeks, surpassing the United States, where more than 7 million people have been infected.Sunday\u2019s surge has raised the country\u2019s virus tally to over 5.9 million. India, however, also has the highest number of recovered patients in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University. Its recovery rate stands at about 82%.Health experts have cautioned about two major events next month: the legislative election in Bihar state, with nearly 72 million people eligible to vote, and a major religious festival season that includes huge congregations.\u2014-MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Australia\u2019s second-largest city, Melbourne, has further eased lockdown restrictions imposed after a surge in coronavirus cases, allowing most children to return to school from next month and sending more than 125,000 people back to work.Melbourne and surrounding parts of rural Victoria state were placed under strict \u201cLevel 4\u201d lockdowns on Aug. 2, shuttering schools and non-essential businesses, imposing a nighttime curfew and prohibiting public gatherings.The restrictions were scheduled to be eased Sunday if the rolling 14-day average of new infections was between 30 and 50 cases. With 12 new infections reported Saturday and 16 Sunday, the 14-day average has dropped to 22.1.That allowed Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews to confirm the 9 p.m.- 5.a.m curfew will be lifted from 5 a.m. Monday, though residents still cannot travel more than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from home. Public gatherings of up to five people from a maximum of two households will be allowed.A further easing could take place on Oct. 19 if the average falls below five new cases per day. Masks remain mandatory.Andrews said there are 399 active cases in Victoria, the first time that number has fallen below 400 since June 30.___LONG BEACH, Calif. \u2014 The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation reports two prisoners have died at hospitals of coronavirus-related complications. One prisoner was at the California Institution for Men in Chino. He was the 22nd inmate at the prison to die of coronavirus complications. The second prisoner was at Avenal State Prison in Avenal. He was the sixth inmate to die of complications from the virus at the facility. The department did not provide more details about the deaths. Meanwhile, all California State University, Long Beach students who live on campus have been placed in quarantine and all in-person instruction will be halted for two weeks because five students tested positive for COVID-19.___MADISON, Wis. \u2014 Wisconsin on Saturday hit a record for coronavirus cases reported in a single day as health officials reported 2,817 people have tested positive for the virus.The state has seen some of the nation\u2019s fastest coronavirus spread over the last two weeks. The rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 950, an increase of nearly 97%, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. In that time, the state has reported the nation\u2019s third-highest number of new cases per capita, with about 423 new cases per 100,000 people.In another troubling trend, the positivity rate for coronavirus testing has also been among the country\u2019s highest. That\u2019s an indicator that many more people have infections than tests are revealing. The seven-day positivity rate is currently over 17%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Saturday\u2019s positivity rate for testing was even higher at 22%.Over the course of the pandemic, 113,645 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Wisconsin and 1,281 have died. The Department of Health Services on Saturday reported seven new deaths.___OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 The number of deaths in Oklahoma from the illness caused by the coronavirus has topped 1,000.Officials with the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported Saturday that 11 new COVID-19 deaths raised the state\u2019s toll to 1,004.State health officials also reported that 990 new confirmed cases raised the Oklahoma caseload to at least 83,510. The number of active cases rose by 136 to 12,752. However, the actual number of cases in Oklahoma is likely higher because many people haven\u2019t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. ___HONOLULU -- A state-owned health care organization in Hawaii will take over a veterans care home where 26 residents have died of the coronavirus.The arrangement announced on Friday will see Hawaii Health Systems Corporation take over as the operators of Yukio Okutsu State Veterans Home in Hilo. The previous operator, Utah-based Avalon Health Care, will relinquish all control over the facility.The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports that the veterans home has had a history of falling short on health standards. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services gave the home a health inspection rating of one star out of five.There were 89 residents living at the care home before the outbreak. Since then, 71 residents have contracted the virus along with 35 employees.___ATHENS, Greece \u2014 Authorities are closing street kiosks and minimarkets from midnight to 5 a.m. in the Greek capital and other areas in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus.Such vendors are a popular after-hours source of alcohol for young people, many of whom have been congregating in squares without adhering to social distancing or wearing masks. The closures are set to begin at midnight on Saturday.Greek health officials on Saturday reported 315 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 7 more deaths. That raised the country\u2019s total case count to 17,228 since the pandemic began and its death toll to 376,There are 68 people on ventilators, but many more are in intensive care units and the government is concerned about the capacity of the public health system if trends continue."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/sports-pandemics-virus-outbreak-john-bel-edwards-football-9844fbb927f9e02d31c1a70b8344edb9", "headline": "Amid court feud, Edwards renews Louisiana virus restrictions | AP ...", "date": "2020-11-05T21:59:59Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Even as his coronavirus restrictions are being challenged in court, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Thursday that he\u2019s extending Louisiana\u2019s statewide mask mandate, business limitations and other rules he enacted to combat COVID-19 for another four weeks.House Republicans are trying to throw out all the restrictions and fully reopen state activities, with no face covering requirement, no rules governing bars and restaurants and no crowd limits for sports games or other events despite the pandemic. ADVERTISEMENTBut the Democratic governor is arguing in court that the method the GOP lawmakers used to attack his emergency order is unconstitutional, and he is continuing to enforce the limits. The coronavirus restrictions were set to expire Friday, but Edwards said he\u2019s renewing them through Dec. 4.\u201cWe think we\u2019ve got the balance of things about right,\u201d Edwards said. He added: \u201cThe science is very, very clear, and our experience in Louisiana now is extremely clear. These measures work.\u201dA hearing in the ongoing litigation over the rules is scheduled for Nov. 12, after a judge refused to block Edwards from reissuing his public health emergency order.The broad outline of Edwards\u2019 current Phase 3 rules was enacted in September. The governor, however, has since tweaked portions of the guidelines to allow some bar reopenings and larger crowds at high school football games.The restrictions being renewed allow restaurants, churches, gyms, shopping malls, salons and most other businesses to operate at 75% of their capacity. Tighter limits remain on bars, keeping them to takeout and delivery sales only, unless they operate in parishes where 5% or fewer of the coronavirus tests have come back positive in the last two weeks. In those parishes, bars can open for in-person, onsite drinking at 25% occupancy if local officials agree. An 11 p.m. curfew remains on alcohol sales at restaurants, bars and casinos. Concert halls and indoor live music venues remain strictly regulated on physical distancing among patrons, if they open at all.Most sports events, such as college football games, have crowd limits of 25%. But high school football games held in outside stadiums can boost their crowd sizes to 50% capacity if they\u2019re in those parishes with low percentages of coronavirus tests returning positive.ADVERTISEMENTMore than half of Louisiana\u2019s 64 parishes have reached the virus positivity rates allowed for bars to resume onsite drinking and for larger crowds at high school football games. But not all local leaders have approved the looser rules. New Orleans, for example, maintains tougher restrictions.Louisiana isn\u2019t seeing the latest spikes in COVID-19 happening across the country, but the state reports hundreds of new confirmed cases daily.\u201cThe second that we lose vigilance we\u2019re going to see ourselves, unfortunately, where a number of other states are right now,\u201d said Dr. Joe Kanter, the governor\u2019s chief public health adviser. Republican lawmakers say the statewide rules are too strict eight months after Louisiana saw its first outbreak of the COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus. Louisiana has seen two coronavirus spikes, first in the New Orleans region in March and April, and statewide this summer. The percentage of positive tests and the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have declined since Louisiana\u2019s latest high point in mid-July.Trying to scrap Edwards\u2019 restrictions, House Speaker Clay Schexnayder and 64 other GOP House lawmakers invoked a never-before-used process in Louisiana law that allows a majority of legislators in either the House or Senate to sign a petition to nullify a governor\u2019s emergency declaration. Edwards sued the lawmakers, asking a judge to declare that the governor\u2019s emergency rules remain intact and enforceable and that the petition process is unconstitutional. The governor credits his coronavirus restrictions \u2014 and residents\u2019 willingness to adhere to them \u2014 with helping hold down a third spike in COVID-19 cases. He\u2019s repeatedly noted his decision-making is in line with the recommendations of the White House \u2019s coronavirus task force. At least 5,766 people in Louisiana have died from COVID-19, according to the state Health Department. Louisiana\u2019s death toll is the nation\u2019s fifth highest per capita. Four out of every five of the state\u2019s deaths from COVID-19 involved people aged 60 or older.___Follow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.

Other data released Tuesday shows that nine out of 10 people arrested for coronavirus-related offenses in New York City have been black or Hispanic.Here are the latest coronavirus-related developments in New York:COVER UP Warning that the state isn\u2019t out of danger yet, Cuomo on Tuesday urged New Yorkers to wear masks out of respect for the nurses and doctors who have died to protect people from the pandemic, which he said had killed another 195 people.ADVERTISEMENTDuring his daily briefing, Cuomo recounted a tense conversation about masks he had with a man while on a recent walk with his daughter. He said people should be aware that masks, which are worn to reduce the wearer\u2019s chance of infecting others, are a sign of respect to everyone they walk past, as well as to workers pulling society through the outbreak.\u201cThis mask says, \u2018I respect the nurses and doctors who killed themselves through this virus to save other people. And I respect the nurses and the doctors, so I\u2019m not going to infect anyone or allow anyone else to be infected unnecessarily so I don\u2019t cause more stress on the nurses and the doctors,\u2019\u201d Cuomo said.New York requires people to wear face coverings when in close proximity to others in public. As people grow wearier of the extended lockdown, some complain that requirement infringes on individual liberty. Cuomo instead stressed \u201creciprocal responsibility\u201d as some upstate areas prepare to start phasing in economic activity this week.The 195 deaths recorded in New York are a jump from 161 the previous day, but still about a quarter of the highest daily tallies just over a month ago. Hospitalization rates also continue to decline.____ARREST NUMBERS SHOW RACIAL DISPARITYNine out of 10 people arrested for coronavirus-related offenses in New York City have been black or Hispanic, police department data released Tuesday shows.Of 125 arrested between March 16 and Sunday, 83 were black, 30 were Hispanic, 9 were white and 3 were Asian.The New York Police Department says the pandemic-related arrests fall into broad categories such as hate crimes, domestic violence and resisting arrest. They include fights that broke out over cutting supermarket lines and a bank robbery suspect who gave a note to a teller saying, \u201cthis is a bank robbery, I have COVID.\u201dADVERTISEMENT\u201cThese are not social distancing arrests,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cMany were responses to calls for service where there was a clear victim and police took necessary action.\u201dData released Friday showed that of the 374 summonses issued through May 5 for violating social distancing orders, 52% were given to black people and 30% to Hispanic people. The Legal Aid Society, a public defender group, called on the NYPD to release a \u201cfull and transparent accounting of all police encounters related to social distancing enforcement\u201d including locations of each encounter and demographic details for people stopped, given summonses or arrested. The organization also wants the department to make public the guidance it\u2019s providing officers on social distancing enforcement.___SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERA federal judge has ordered Cuomo to include an American Sign Language interpreter on the screen alongside him as he delivers his daily press briefings.U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni issued the order Monday as she considers a lawsuit filed by a disability rights group that claims Cuomo is the only governor who has failed to do.The governor has argued that the state has provided \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d to deaf New Yorkers through a separate online ASL stream and closed captioning.But the lawsuit filed May 7 by Disability Rights New York included several examples of deaf New Yorkers who lack internet access or who don\u2019t read or write in fluent English. Four individuals named in the lawsuit said they could access Cuomo\u2019s widely watched briefings on television if he offered an additional accommodation of including an interpreter in the frame of his main stream.___SALES TAX DROPNew York\u2019s cities and counties saw a 24.4% drop in local sales tax collections in April compared to April 2019, according to state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.Local governments are grappling with shortfalls as plummeting sales tax collections have left them short about $327 million compared to last year, DiNapoli said Tuesday.New York City saw a 23.1% decline \u2014 or $141.8 million \u2014 in lost revenues in April.\u201cThe coronavirus has hurt household finances, and the April sales tax figures show how deep it is cutting into municipal finances,\u201d DiNapoli said.___OTHER CORONAVIRUS DEVELOPMENTS-New York is now investigating about 100 cases of a syndrome in children that\u2019s thought to be related to the coronavirus. It affects blood vessels and organs and has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock. Three children in the state have died.- The shutdown on Broadway has been extended again \u2014 until at least early September. Although an exact date for performances to resume has yet to be determined,  Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Sept. 6.- Two New England hospital systems tried the latest twist in internet matchmaking: online swap meets.  As the coronavirus pandemic stretches on, online platforms have popped up to match hospitals that need masks, gowns, ventilators and even doctors with those that have extras. - Even as President Donald Trump urges getting people back to work and reopening the economy, an Associated Press analysis shows thousands of people are getting sick from COVID-19 on the job.- One is a Roman Catholic church in Queens; the other, a Lutheran church in Manhattan. But the COVID-19 pandemic has united the two Hispanic congregations in grief.

You know what I mean?\u201dThe album will transport fans to a time when Lewis and his band blazed up the charts with hits like \u201cThe Power of Love,\u201d \u201cI Want a New Drug,\u201d \u201cHip to Be Square\u201d and \u201cStuck with You.\u201dLewis hopes fans will soon hear those songs again when the jukebox musical \u201cThe Heart of Rock & Roll\u201d finds its next stop. The show, which has an original story unconnected to Lewis, broke the record for highest gross per performance at San Diego\u2019s Old Globe theater in 2018. Lewis hopes it gets to Broadway.He\u2019s had a hand in helping the music along, first making sure the songs were handled properly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to be too cringe-worthy,\u201d he says. Lewis tweaked some lyrics to make them able to be sung by different people and in contexts he never anticipated, crediting music supervisor and orchestrator Brian Usifer for creatively reworking his tunes for a word-driven show.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cWhen our version zigs, his version zags, and he stayed away from our versions and yet sort of reinvented them. And it\u2019s really, really neat,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cThe best comment that I get when people see the show is that it seems like the songs were written for the show.\u201dUsifer, a songwriter himself as well as the music director of \u201cKinky Boots\u201d and \u201cFrozen\u201d on Broadway, grew up as a fan of Lewis\u2019 music and was bowled over when Lewis trusted him to change it to make it work onstage.\u201cSupportive is the word I would say he\u2019s been the most: Game to try anything and game to see something work or not work,\u201d Usifer says. He and Lewis also wrote the new song \u201cBe Someone\u201d specifically for the musical, something the younger man calls the \u201cultimate thrill.\u201d Usifer has worked with Lewis after the Meniere\u2019s disease diagnosis and says the two have managed to work out a way to communicate about the music. \u201cI give him so much credit for being so open and brave about it,\u201d he says. \u201cHe comes to rehearsals and he\u2019s a happy, positive guy who\u2019s really thrilled to be there. For whatever he\u2019s going through outside of that, he allows the process to still be productive and positive.\u201d The musical and the album have kept Lewis busy and kept his mind off his hearing loss. He relies on hearing aids that play tones. When he puts them on and hears five, he\u2019s good. Bad days are when he can only hear one.\u201cThe first two months were suicidal. I mean I literally would contemplate my demise,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d think, \u2018Man, this is horrible. I can\u2019t live like this.\u2019 Tinnitus roaring in my head and couldn\u2019t hear anything. But, you know, you can get used to almost anything.\u201dMusic is still coming out of him, thankfully. On the album, Lewis wrote a very personal song about his love affair with music called \u201cOne of the Boys.\u201d He was asked to write the song for Willie Nelson and said he really didn\u2019t think much of it. \u201cThen weeks later for some reason I just woke up with this song completely in my head,\u201d he says.It\u2019s a twangy tune with lyrics about the singer being 9 or 10 when he saw his very first band. \u201cI knew immediately, that\u2019s where I wanted to be/with them boys up on the stand/playing in a honky-tonk band,\u201d go the lyrics. Nelson never recorded it but Lewis still loved it so he added it to \u201cWeather.\u201d \u201cWhen I finished writing it I realized, \u2018Oh my God. It\u2019s my life story. It\u2019s exactly my life story,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt was one of the things that just came through me and I realized, \u2018Oh my gosh. This came from somewhere deep.\u2019\u201d___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/bees-albuquerque-animals-new-mexico-ec537a1b4c924c687411590d585fd3f3", "headline": "New Mexico unveils 'pollinator protection' license plate | AP News", "date": "2020-03-28T04:01:12Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "SANTA FE, N.M.

Their run through the playoffs has prompted watch parties and celebrations. Los Angeles County is the nation\u2019s largest, with 10 million residents, and positive cases there increased this month from an average of 940 per day to nearly 1,200 last week, Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said. ADVERTISEMENTShe praised fans\u2019 \u201cincredible spirit,\u201d but \u201cthe downside of this is that during a pandemic some of the things we\u2019ve done in the past just don\u2019t make sense.\u201dHealth officials have warned of a second wave of virus cases and Ferrer said LA County\u2019s increase wasn\u2019t immediately apparent because of a backlog of cases due to technical issues with data collection systems. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing, first, very low case numbers a couple weeks ago and then in the last few days very high case numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve processed the backlog of cases from the state, and analyzed the numbers by episode date, it is clear that our cases increased. This increase is not as steep as what we saw in July, but this is a cause of concern.\u201d Health officials rely on having accurate data to forecast surges in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, intensive care needs and deaths. California overall has reported steady numbers even as there have been surges in many other states.State officials also use the data to determine whether counties can advance to less restrictive tiers in the state\u2019s four-stage, color-coded system. Los Angeles County remains in the most restrictive tier while most San Francisco Bay Area counties have moved to fewer restrictions and San Francisco itself is in the most permissive category.The problem came as the state prepared for the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of a shift Saturday to a new data collection system that was prompted in part by earlier problems, said California Health and Human Services Agency spokeswoman Kate Folmar.Though going well overall, in the final weeks of the switch-over there was \u201ca one-day processing issue\u201d on Oct. 13 involving several laboratories, she said in an email. As a result there was some duplication of data sent to Los Angeles and San Diego counties, which caused a backlog for LA County but not San Diego.All counties now seem to have caught up, she said, and the state\u2019s \u201coverall case data remains relatively stable with some slight upward trends that we are monitoring closely.\u201dThe problem did not affect the state\u2019s models or its forecasting, she said, and will not influence LA County\u2019s purple tier status.As a result of problems from the backlog, statewide reported cases jumped from 2,940 on Wednesday to 6,141 on Thursday and remained above 5,000 newly reported cases on Friday and Saturday before dipping back to 2,981 on Monday.The state Department of Public Health, in a note on its tracking web page, said that the daily number of new cases included an estimated 2,000 backlog cases from Los Angeles County. Neighboring Orange and Riverside counties said they did not have a backlog, and none was reported by other major counties including San Francisco.A much larger backlog problem involving up to 300,000 records overwhelmed California\u2019s infectious diseases reporting system in August and forced it to hasten the creation of a new dedicated data collection system. The state\u2019s public health director abruptly resigned days later.The LA County backlog that resulted in the roller-coaster numbers came from \u201ca technical glitch that nobody really foresaw,\u201d Ferrer said. \u201cWe had a very big dump of backlogged data from the state,\u201d she said, but \u201cthere was something that cycled wrong with our own system here that created a lot of duplicate cases and it took time to clean all that out.\u201dThe problems caused LA County\u2019s reported cases to jump seven-fold overnight, from 510 on Wednesday to 3,600 on Thursday and remain above 2,000 new reported cases until dropping to 830 on Sunday.The Dodgers can clinch the World Series on Tuesday against the Tamp Bay Rays. Ferrer urged residents to cheer on their team but do so responsibly. \u201cCelebrate in ways that don\u2019t actually result in increases in our cases,\u201d she urged, ending her virtual news conference with: \u201dGo Dodgers.\u201dFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. ____Associated Press writer Amy Taxin contributed from Orange County."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/minneapolis-minnesota-us-news-mn-state-wire-religion-da2210e54c3aaf1efb0d56bca366a9e4", "headline": "LGBTQ activists, Gov.

Tim Walz and LGBTQ activists rallied at the state Capitol on Friday to demand that the Republican-controlled Minnesota Senate pass a ban on \u201cconversion therapy\u201d for minors, a discredited practice that seeks to turn gay people straight.The proposal passed the Democratic-controlled House last year but an effort to amend it onto a larger bill on the Senate floor by Sen. Scott Dibble failed late in the session. The Minneapolis Democrat, who is openly gay, said he plans to reintroduce it this year, though he acknowledged in an interview that enacting it will be an uphill fight.ADVERTISEMENTBut he has an ally in the Democratic governor. Walz pointed out to a crowd of about 100 people in the Capitol rotunda that 19 other states have enacted conversion therapy bans, most recently conservative Utah last month, while a Republican-controlled legislative committee in Oklahoma approved a ban Wednesday. \u201cThe idea that this absolutely discredited, Byzantine, torturous way of telling our children they are not who they are has got to end and will end,\u201d Walz said.Roger Sanchez, an activist with the LGBTQ civil rights group OutFront Minnesota, described himself as a survivor of conversion therapy. He said he grew up thinking there was something wrong with him because he was gay, so he consented when people he trusted proposed conversion therapy. He said he still suffers nightmares because of it.\u201cI was brainwashed to believe that being LGBTQ was wrong. My rainbow at that time was drained of its color. I smiled but inside I was dying,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cHowever, in college I connected with LGBTQ-affirming students. I realized I wasn\u2019t alone in my struggle. They are the ones who helped me accept myself.\u201dThe American Psychological Association says conversion therapy is not based in science and is harmful to mental health.Sue Abderholden, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said she attended the rally \u201cbecause being LGBTQ is not a mental illness, and you can\u2019t provide therapy to something that isn\u2019t an illness.\u201dRepublican Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a conservative Christian from Nisswa, did not immediately respond to messages via his spokeswoman seeking comment on whether the Senate might consider the bill this year. ADVERTISEMENTThe Senate voted down a ban on a party-line vote last May, with Republicans arguing that it was matter of religious freedom. After that, the Star Tribune revealed that Gazelka\u2019s adult daughter, Genna Gazelka, came out as a lesbian as a teen and now identifies as bi-gender. Genna Gazelka was upset with the vote and told the newspaper that conversion therapy is tantamount to torture.Dibble said in an interview that he plans to ask the Senate leadership to allow hearings on his bill. He said \u201ca number\u201d of his Republican colleagues in the Senate want to vote yes. He named Sens. Scott Jensen, of Chaska, and Eric Pratt, of Prior Lake, as Republicans he\u2019s working with who could vote for it if they had the chance. Republicans hold just a narrow three-vote majority in the Senate, but Dibble said getting the bill to the floor for a vote would require some creative thinking.\u201cWe\u2019re working together on finding a path to get to yes,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/la-state-wire-music-new-orleans-entertainment-louisiana-f1f6071b6c5a3901de31f9814c1769c8", "headline": "New Orleans Jazz Fest is latest COVID-19 economic casualty | AP ...", "date": "2020-04-16T22:36:33Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The 2020 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival was officially canceled Thursday, the latest economic and entertainment industry casualty in Louisiana\u2019s fight to halt the spread of the new coronavirus.Festival organizers had already postponed the festival, which usually spans two spring weekends, until the fall. But they announced on the festival website that they would not attempt this year to hold the event. The festival, which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, draws more than 400,000 visitors to the Fair Grounds Race Course for music on multiple stages, a variety of cuisines at dozens of food booths and an arts and crafts fair.The plan now is to hold the 2021 festival during its traditional time, the last weekend in April and the first weekend in May. Mayor LaToya Cantrell earlier this week urged cancellation of major city festivals. The Essence Festival, usually held in New Orleans in July, has also canceled for this year.The announcement came as Gov. John Bel Edwards announced the creation of an 18-member commission to help the state plot a course for eventually reopening businesses shuttered during the fight against the coronavirus.The Democratic governor\u2019s announcement came as the state\u2019s COVID-19 death toll climbed by 53. More than 1,100 deaths have been attributed to the disease in Louisiana. But, the number of people hospitalized, and the number requiring ventilators dropped Thursday, the latest indicators of a positive trend in the state\u2019s fight.Edwards said Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican, will be among those serving on the Resilient Louisiana Commission. The commission will be led by state Secretary of Economic Development Secretary Don Pierson and health care consultant Terrie Sterling. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get back to normal until we have a vaccine and some effective therapeutic treatments,\u201d Edwards said at a morning, live-streamed news conference in Baton Rouge. \u201cBut, we\u2019re not going to wait until then to start reopening the economy.\u201dStill, Edwards made clear that the reopening won\u2019t be immediate. He pointed to statistics indicating stay-at-home orders and business closures have slowed the spread of COVID-19 and avoided overwhelming state hospitals. \u201cThis is not the time to let up,\u201d he said.Rep. Steve Scalise, a Republican attended the news conference and agreed with the governor. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about picking a choice between safety and economic recovery,\u201d Scalise added. \u201cYou can do both and we have to do both.\u201dMore than 1,100 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 in Louisiana \u2014 53 were added to the death toll Thursday. But the state has seen encouraging signs in combating the virus, with slowing rates of new infections and new hospitalizations, and fewer patients on ventilators. Edwards credits people remaining physically distanced from others.By Thursday, the state had more than 22,000 known cases. and the number has consistently increased as testing has become more available. Officials say there are signs of hope in slowing rates of new infections and new hospitalizations, and fewer patients on ventilators. The number hospitalized fell slightly Thursday, to 1,914 from 1,943 the day before. It was over 2,000 last week. The number needing ventilators as of Thursday was 396, down from 425 on Wednesday and well below last week\u2019s totals.Still, Edwards has repeatedly said social distancing must continue to keep the numbers down. In New Orleans, which has more than 5,700 cases, Mayor LaToya Cantrell on Tuesday extended a stay-at-home order until May 16. It had been scheduled to end on April 30.ADVERTISEMENTIn an online town hall Thursday afternoon on nola.com and theadvocate.com , Edwards said Louisiana, because of its high number of cases, may lag other states in being able to ease restrictions. But he held out hope that some type of easing could begin May 1. He said his staff was going through the latest guidelines from the White House on thresholds that should be met before restrictions are eased.\u201cWe don\u2019t\u2019 meet some of them today but by May 1 we could meet all of them,\u201d Edwards said.At his earlier news conference Thursday, Edwards pointed to charts showing hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients in the state health department\u2019s Region 1, which includes hard hit New Orleans and Jefferson Parish. He said there were 790 beds occupied by COVID-19 patients this week. Projections were that there would have been 3000 such patients had stay-at-home orders not been implemented, Edwards said.For most people, the highly contagious coronavirus causes symptoms such as high fever and a dry cough that resolve in several weeks. But some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, can suffer severe symptoms that can be fatal.\u2014-This story corrects that Nungesser is not the chairperson of the commission.\u2014-Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak  and  https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/business-small-business-mississippi-floods-aba5d8354d316450497d0ce6b05a22d8", "headline": "Dec. 28 deadline for loans for Mississippi Feb. flood damage | AP ...", "date": "2020-11-26T15:41:52Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Small Business Administration is reminding people in Mississippi about the deadline to apply for low-interest loans to recover from floods that occurred Feb. 10-14.

They wanted to hear her talk. Ginsburg was invited to speak so often that inevitably she was asked the same questions and delivered the same punch lines, always, it seemed, to a delighted new audience.ADVERTISEMENTSome of the things Ginsburg liked to tell groups:WHAT SHE HAD IN COMMON WITH A RAPPERGinsburg came to be known as \u201cThe Notorious RBG,\u201d a play on the name of the rapper \u201dThe Notorious B.I.G.\u201d Ginsburg liked to note they had one important thing in common. Both were born and bred in Brooklyn, New York.WHEN ASKED FOR HER ADVICEGinsburg often dispensed a piece of wisdom her mother-in-law gave her on her wedding day. The secret to a happy marriage is this: \u201cSometimes it helps to be a little deaf.\u201d Ginsburg said it was excellent advice in dealing with her colleagues on the court, too.ON EQUAL PARENTINGGinsburg\u2019s son James was what she called a \u201clively child,\u201d and she would often get calls from his New York City school about his latest caper. Ginsburg finally told the school: \u201cThis child has two parents. Please alternate calls.\u201d It was Ginsburg\u2019s husband\u2019s turn, she said.So Ginsburg\u2019s husband went to the school and was told James had \u201cstolen the elevator,\u201d taking a group of kindergartners for a ride.But \u201cafter the elevator incident, the calls came barely once a semester,\u201d Ginsburg noted, and not because James was any better behaved. \u201cThey were much more reluctant to take a man away from his work than a woman,\u201d Ginsburg liked to explain.ON FACING DISCRIMINATIONGinsburg often noted that she had \u201cthree strikes\u201d against her in trying to get a job when she graduated from Columbia\u2019s law school in 1959, despite graduating at the top of her class. She was Jewish. She was a wife. And she was a mother.\u201cGetting the first job was hard for women of my vintage,\u201d she\u2019d say. \u201cBut once you got the first job you did it at least as well as the men and so the next step was not as hard.\u201d ADVERTISEMENTGinsburg also liked to note something Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor would say: \u201cSandra said, \u2018Where would the two of us be if there had been no discrimination?\u2019 Well, today we\u2019d be retired partners from a large law firm.\u201dON HER FRIENDSHIP WITH ANTONIN SCALIAThe genuine friendship between the liberal Ginsburg and conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, puzzled many audiences. Ginsburg explained: \u201cThe number one reason why I loved Justice Scalia so is he made me laugh.\u201d The two shared a love of opera. And they were close enough that their families spent New Year\u2019s together. Scalia would sometimes call to point out grammar errors in Ginsburg\u2019s opinion drafts. Ginsburg, for her part, would sometimes tell him: \u201cThis opinion is so overheated, you\u2019d be more persuasive if you tone it down.\u201d She liked to say: \u201cHe never listened to that.\u201dGinsburg often described a famous picture of the two of them riding an elephant together in India, the heavyset Scalia in front and diminutive Ginsburg in the rear. Ginsburg\u2019s feminist friends were horrified. Why was she in the back? Weight distribution, she explained. ON HER ACHIEVEMENTSGinsburg\u2019s mother, Celia Bader, who died the day before Ginsburg gradated high school, never attended college but worked as a bookkeeper. Ginsburg would sometimes ask audiences: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a bookkeeper in New York\u2019s Garment District and a U.S. Supreme Court justice?\u201d Her answer: \u201cOne generation.\u201dON CHANGING THE CONSTITUTIONWhen asked how she might change the Constitution if given the opportunity, Ginsburg liked to point to the effort in the 1970s to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, which fell three states short of ratification. Ginsburg said passing it was still a good idea.\u201cI have three granddaughters,\u201d Ginsburg liked to say. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to be able to take out my pocket Constitution and say that the equal citizenship stature of men and women is a fundamental tenet of our society.\u201dON THE SUPREME COURT\u2019S WOMENGinsburg, the second female justice, was sometimes asked when there would be enough women on the Supreme Court. Her response: \u201cWhen there are nine.\u201d She\u2019d explain: \u201cSome people are taken aback until they remember that for most of our country\u2019s history there were only men on the high court bench.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/john-glenn-annie-glenn-4c7f37e4df1b48c6bc6c444b54f995f2", "headline": "Annie Glenn, widow of American icon John Glenn, dies at 100 | AP ...", "date": "2020-05-19T16:56:38Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "She lived her entire life with a man who became universally revered, but to millions across the globe, Annie Glenn was her own kind of hero.The wife of John Glenn, the former astronaut and U.S. senator, died early Tuesday morning at a nursing home near family in St. Paul, Minnesota. She was 100.Mr. Glenn died in 2016 at age 95 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.Annie, as everyone knew her, lived in the shadow of fame, but emerged in mid-life to become an inspiration for people with disabilities around the world by overcoming the chronic stuttering that afflicted and limited her during the years her husband was becoming a household name.She was born Anna Margaret Castor in Columbus on Feb. 17, 1920, and her father, a dentist, moved the family to New Concord when she was 3. Her parents joined a monthly card club called \u201cTwice 5 Club,\u201d which included John Glenn\u2019s parents. She and John, who was 17 months younger, shared a playpen from whence a quintessential love story would take root.ADVERTISEMENTDespite her speech impediment \u2014 she stuttered 85% of the time \u2014 Annie was a top student and readily was accepted in the close-knit college town 70 miles east of Columbus in rural Muskingum County. In the sixth grade, however, she experienced her first hint of the humiliation that would haunt her through much of her life when one of the students laughed at her as she recited a poem before the class.\u201cI realized I was not normal,\u201d Annie told The Dispatch in 2007. \u201cI was lucky to have grown up where I was accepted. When I went out in the world, even to Zanesville and Cambridge, I had a lot of hurt feelings. I knew I was loved and accepted in New Concord.\u201dThe spark between John and Annie ignited in junior high school, and they both stayed home to attend Muskingum College. Annie, a dark-eyed beauty, dreamed of being a teacher but pursued a music degree because she played the organ and could sing without stuttering.John\u2019s education was interrupted by World War II, but before heading off to flight training in the Marine Corps, he gave Annie an engagement ring. On her own, Annie went to Dayton in search of a job and confronted the everyday limitations of stuttering.\u201cI had to write out where I wanted to go and I handed it to the bus driver,\u201d she remembered. \u201cHe thought I was deaf. He wrote back how much money I needed. Lots of people thought when my jaws sort of started shaking (as she tried to talk) that I was cold. Lots of people would turn their backs and walk away from me. I have been laughed at many times.\u201dBefore shipping out for combat in the South Pacific on a cold January morning in 1944, John held Annie tightly, searching for the right words.\u201cI\u2019m just going down to the corner store to get a pack of gum,\u201d he said.\u201cDon\u2019t be long,\u201d she whispered, and from that day on she kept a gum wrapper in her purse.ADVERTISEMENTAs John\u2019s prowess as a pilot culminated in his historic orbital flight on Feb. 20, 1962, the spotlight shone ever more intensely on the Glenn family, which by then included a son, David, and a daughter, Lyn. After becoming the first American to orbit the earth, John and his wife were cheered in a ticker-tape parade in New York City. Celebrity pursued them relentlessly and each brush with the media and famous people painfully revealed Annie\u2019s stuttering.With reporters in tow after the flight, then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was intent on visiting the Glenns at their Arlington, Va., home, but John angered Johnson by refusing to receive him, proffering the excuse that Annie was in bed with a migraine to spare her from the attention. Even so, the Glenns became good friends with Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird.They also became close to former Attorney General Bobby Kennedy and his wife, Ethel. Annie was especially fond of Bobby because of the warmth and patience he showed when they conversed. During Kennedy\u2019s presidential run in 1968, the Glenns were with him the night he was murdered in Los Angeles, and Ethel asked John and Annie to fly with their children back to Virginia.Annie remembered being afraid to use the telephone and worried that she wouldn\u2019t be able to summon help if her children were hurt, and she said that \u201cmicrophones paralyzed me.\u201d Yet when her husband was unable to campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1964 after a near-fatal head-banging fall in his Columbus bathroom, Annie bravely hit the campaign trail on his behalf, taking along Rene Carpenter, a close friend and wife of astronaut Scott Carpenter, to be her voice.Through the years, Annie tried different treatment programs, but none worked until she and John, watching the Today Show one morning in 1973, heard Dr. Ronald Webster, a psychologist and director of the Communications Research Institute at Hollins College in Roanoke, Va., describe a new treatment he had developed for stutterers. After three weeks away from John, Annie called him from Hollins. For the first time in 53 years, she did something she had never done before: She spoke a complete sentence without stuttering. Her husband wept.By 1984, Annie was delivering speeches across the country on behalf of her husband\u2019s short-lived presidential candidacy, and she devoted herself to helping other stutterers and people with disabilities. In 1983, she received the first national award of the American Speech and Hearing Association for \u201cproviding an inspiring model for people with communicative disorders.\u201d In 1987, the National Association for Hearing and Speech Action honored her by asking her to present the first annual Annie Glenn Award for achieving distinction despite a communicative disorder.Roughly a decade ago, Annie, in her 80s, was invited to lecture a speech-and-hearing class at Ohio State University. Facing the students, she finally had realized her dream of being a teacher. \u201cThe tears were rolling down my cheeks,\u201d she later told The Dispatch.A memorial service is being planned in Columbus."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/economy-health-virus-outbreak-wa-state-wire-id-state-wire-5fadaa10250b54d642b1b8c3a1f687d8", "headline": "Pause for phased reopening extended through July 28 | AP News", "date": "2020-07-14T22:47:26Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Tuesday that the statewide pause for counties looking to advance from their current stage of economic reopening will continue though at least July 28 and he warned there is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d that parts of the economy may have to be closed again if coronavirus activity continues to climb.The pause \u2014 implemented earlier this month \u2014 was originally intended to be in place for two weeks for the state\u2019s 39 counties, which are in various phases of a four-stage economic reopening plan. But Inslee said the number of confirmed cases and hospitalization rate is troubling.\u201cWe\u2019re not in as bad of shape as some other states. But we have to look where we\u2019re going to be, not just where we are,\u201d Inslee said at a news conference. \u201cAnd we are heading to big trouble if we do not figure out a way to knock this pandemic down.\u201dInslee mentioned states like Oregon and California, which recently rolled back reopenings in response to a spike in cases. \u201cDoing so would be really tough,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the status quo, we know, is very, very dangerous right now.\u201dInslee said the actions people take now \u2014 including wearing facial coverings and maintaining physical distance from others \u2014 \u201cis going to determine what this virus looks like in the fall.\u201dLast week, an enhanced statewide order took effect that requires businesses to refuse service to customers who don\u2019t wear facial coverings. That order builds on previous mask requirements issued last month.Exemptions exist for people who are deaf or have hearing loss, those who have medical conditions that preclude them from wearing a mask and children age 5 and younger.And people engaged in recreation alone or with household members and those eating out at restaurants don\u2019t have to wear masks as long as they are properly distanced from others.Seventeen counties are in Phase 3 of reopening, which allows gyms and movie theaters to operate at half capacity, restaurants to increase capacity to 75% and for group gatherings of up to 50 people, including sports activities. Standalone bars in counties in this phase are still allowed to stay open and provide table service, but bar seating is not permitted.Seventeen counties are currently in Phase 2, which allows restaurants and taverns to operate at half capacity with limited table sizes, hair and nail salons and barber shops to resume business, and retail stores to reopen for in-store purchases at 30% capacity. It also allows additional outdoor recreation and gatherings with no more than five people outside of a person\u2019s household.Five counties \u2014 Benton, Chelan, Douglas, Franklin and Yakima \u2014 are currently the only counties in a modified Phase 1 of reopening, which allows some additional business activity beyond essential businesses.Also Tuesday, the Department of Health released a new death data report that includes different categories of deaths related to COVID-19.The report comes a day after the state Department of Health had reported they reduced the number of coronavirus deaths in the state after determining 39 deaths had been from natural causes.ADVERTISEMENTThe latest numbers released Tuesday found that in the cases of 1,458 deaths where the person tested positive for COVID-19, 65 were determined to not have the virus as a cause or contributing factor of death: nine died due to homicide, suicide or accident and 56 were determined to be natural deaths.Of the 1,393 cases that remain, 1,301 are confirmed coronavirus deaths, 25 are where death certificates are pending or missing a cause of death, and 67 are suspected to be COVID-19 related but their death certificates don\u2019t reflect that. The Department of Health will follow up on each case of suspect deaths to determine the cause.Additionally, there are 80 deaths where a death certificate lists COVID-19 as a cause or contributor to a death, but where the person does not have a known positive coronavirus test. That number is not not included in the daily count.Statewide, more than 41,700 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed.The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, and the vast majority recover. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness and death in some patients, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.Officials said that determining the extent to which the coronavirus contributes to a person\u2019s death makes the process complex and data is likely to continue to change over time."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/basketball-iowa-high-school-basketball-agate-package-vinton-cb390681865874624452ed184e81bf1f", "headline": "Tuesday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2020-12-09T05:48:28Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BOYS BASKETBALL=Baton Rouge Episcopal 78, ESA 58Beau Chene 51, Port Allen 50Benton 68, Mansfield 56Buckeye 58, Montgomery 24Captain Shreve 49, Holy Savior Menard 29Central Catholic 83, Berwick 25Central Private 86, Maurepas 34Delcambre 64, Erath 30Denham Springs 81, Covington 75Doyle 72, Walker 70Dunham 66, St. Thomas More 52Evans 53, DeQuincy 49French Settlement 52, St. John 35Glen Oaks 52, Tara 50Grace Christian 66, Family Community 22Hahnville 75, Jesuit 70Haughton 45, Shreveport Northwood 42Helen Cox 66, Higgins 27Hicks 57, Merryville 52Homer 62, Jonesboro-Hodge 47Kaplan 52, Gueydan 41Kilbourne 65, Forest 58Kinder 72, Reeves 44Lakeview 65, St. Mary\u2019s 48Lena Northwood 86, Grant 54Live Oak 55, West Feliciana 43Minden 52, Airline 48Natchitoches Central 71, Tioga 48Neville 64, Richwood 57North Caddo 54, Southwood 51Northshore 61, Salmen 51Northside Christian 55, Hackberry 53Northwest 59, LaGrange 43Ouachita Parish 47, Bossier 43Parkview Baptist 62, Central - B.R. 55Parkway 59, B.T.

Charles was shown around the 19th-century church by Archimandrite Roman Krassovsky, the local head of the Russian Orthodox Church, who offered prayers as nuns dressed in black sang hymns. ADVERTISEMENTThe Prince of Wales made no public remarks, but he paid tribute to his grandmother the night before at the World Holocaust Forum, which was attended by dozens of other world leaders and coincided with the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp.\u201cI have long drawn inspiration from the selfless actions of my dear grandmother, Princess Alice of Greece, who in 1943, in Nazi-occupied Athens, saved a Jewish family by taking them into her home and hiding them,\u201d Charles said.She is counted as one of the Righteous Among the Nations, an honor bestowed by Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial on non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. Charles said that was a source of \u201cimmense pride\u201d for him and the royal family. She was born Princess Alice of Battenberg in 1885. She was deaf from birth and suffered from mental illness, but managed to devote much of her life to aiding the poor, the sick and refugees.The great granddaughter of Queen Victoria married Prince Andrew of Greece in 1903 and had five children, including Prince Philip, the future Duke of Edinburgh and consort to Queen Elizabeth II. The family was driven into exile on two occasions, and the princess was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and spent time in a sanitarium after suffering a nervous breakdown.She became a Greek Orthodox nun in 1928 while living in France, and returned to Athens alone in 1940, living in her brother-in-law\u2019s three-story residence. During World War II, she worked with the Swedish and Swiss Red Cross to help those in need. She later founded an order of nuns known as the Christian Sisterhood of Mary and Martha. When the Nazis entered Athens in 1943, she sheltered three members of the Cohen family. The father of the family, former parliamentarian Haim Cohen, had been close to the royal family until he passed away that year. Princess Alice did not not know Cohen\u2019s wife, Rachel, or his daughter, Tilde, but hid them away in her mansion anyway, and later sheltered Rachel\u2019s son, Michael, as well.ADVERTISEMENTYad Vashem says the princess regularly visited with the family and wanted to learn more about their Jewish faith. At one point, when suspicious Gestapo officers came to the home to interview her, the princess used her deafness to avoid answering their questions, it said.Her own family, however, fought on both sides of the Second World War. Prince Philip served in the British Royal Navy, while her German royal sons-in-law fought for the Nazis. The Nazis and their collaborators killed 6 million Jews during the war.Alice died in Buckingham Palace in 1969 and was later interred in the church in Jerusalem. She had requested to be buried next to her aunt Elizabeth, the Grand Duchess of Russia, who had also devoted her life to charity and was canonized as a Russian Orthodox saint. Elizabeth\u2019s tomb is in the church itself, while Alice was laid to rest in a small, attached chapel. Prince William visited the tomb of Alice, his great-grandmother, in June 2018. In a 1994 visit to the Holy Land, Prince Philip planted a tree at Yad Vashem in his mother\u2019s honor and visited her grave.

Jay Inslee announced Thursday that because of an increase in the rate of COVID-19 infection, starting next week, bar seating will no longer be permitted for counties currently in Phase 3 of the state\u2019s four-stage reopening plan and businesses statewide will not be able to serve customers who don\u2019t wear facial coverings.Inslee also announced he is ordering a two-week statewide pause for counties looking to advance from their current stage of reopening.Initially, only businesses in Yakima County \u2014 which has been among the areas hardest hit by the outbreak \u2014 faced liability if they did not prohibit allowing a customer to enter a business, or conducted business with a customer if they were not wearing a facial covering in any public space, indoor our outdoors. Violations are a gross misdemeanor and businesses risk fines and losing their business license if they don\u2019t comply.ADVERTISEMENT Now that requirement applies to businesses statewide, though a spokesman for Inslee said the focus will be on education and seeking voluntary compliance first. \u201cWe know that we need to mask up so that we can fully open up our economy,\u201d Inslee said.The face covering exemptions under the governor\u2019s original order issued last week remain: people who are deaf or have hearing loss and those who have medical conditions that preclude them from wearing a mask, don\u2019t need to don a facial covering, nor do children age 5 and younger. And people engaged in recreation alone or with household members and those eating out at restaurants don\u2019t have to wear masks as long as they are properly distanced from others.The issue of mandating masks has drawn a partisan divide in some areas, though in recent days \u2014 as cases of COVID-19 have surged in several states \u2014 national GOP officials have pushed back against the notion that masks are about politics. \u201cThis virus does not discriminate between Rs and Ds,\u201d Inslee said. Inslee\u2019s updated mask order builds on a previous one in place since June 8 that has required workers to wear facial coverings unless they don\u2019t interact with others on the job. The state has seen large increases of confirmed cases in recent days, and on Thursday, reported 728 new confirmed cases, bringing the statewide total of those who have tested positive for coronavirus to 34,151, with at least 1,342 people deaths.Secretary of Health John Weisman called the trend \u201cvery concerning\u201d and said that the increase in cases can\u2019t solely be attributed to more testing. He said that the numbers reflect increased social interactions throughout the state where people aren\u2019t abiding by physical distancing or use of masks.\u201dWe are going in the wrong direction,\u201d he said.The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, and the vast majority recover. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness and death in some patients, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.The state\u2019s stay-at-home order expired May 31 and the state\u2019s 39 counties have been moving through a phased-in reopening process based on several indicators, including case counts.ADVERTISEMENTAs of Thursday, 17 counties are in Phase 3 of reopening, which allows gyms and movie theaters to operate at half capacity, for restaurants to increase capacity to 75% and for group gatherings of up to 50 people, including sports activities. Seventeen counties are currently in Phase 2, which allows restaurants and taverns to reopen at half capacity with limited table sizes, hair and nail salons and barber shops to resume business, and retail stores to reopen for in-store purchases at 30% capacity. It also allows additional outdoor recreation and gatherings with no more than five people outside of a person\u2019s household. Following Inslee\u2019s announcement Thursday, the state Department of Health will continue to work with the last three counties that remain in Phase 1 of the state\u2019s four-stage reopening plan \u2014 Benton, Franklin and Yakima \u2014 to move into a \u201cmodified\u201d Phase 1 that allows some additional business activity beyond essential businesses and takeout service from restaurants. Weisman said that because the state has already been working with those counties, they could be moved into their new modified stage even as other counties are paused.Inslee said residents from those counties had been traveling to other less restrictive counties, raising concerns about additional spread of the virus. He said that he hopes by allowing more local activity, plus the increased use of masks, people will stay local.Yakima County, which has been among the areas hardest hit by the outbreak, had at least 7,270 cases of coronavirus as of Thursday \u2014 second-highest among counties in the state \u2014 and 159 deaths. King County, which includes Seattle and has nearly 10 times more people, had recorded at least 10,535 cases and 615 deaths.Two other counties \u2014 Chelan and Douglas \u2014 are currently the only counties in a modified Phase 1 of reopening."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/nanfu-wang-sundance-film-festival-questlove-coronavirus-pandemic-documentaries-af4dc31f25120adb4e2d34fea33f6355", "headline": "Sundance Film Festival unveils slate for 1st virtual edition | AP News", "date": "2020-12-15T20:48:10Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "A Questlove-directed documentary about the other major music event of the summer of 1969 and documentaries about the creators of Sesame Street and the coronavirus pandemic in China are among the 72 feature films debuting at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival. Organizers on Tuesday unveiled a robust and diverse slate for the festival, which will be largely virtual due to the pandemic. The festival will kick off on Jan. 28 with the premieres of Nanfu Wang\u2019s documentary about propaganda and COVID-19 in China, \u201cIn the Same Breath,\u201d and Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson\u2019s \u201cSummer of Soul (...Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised)\u201d about the forgotten 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, which celebrated Black music and culture and attracted over 300,000 people. ADVERTISEMENT\u201cWe\u2019re starting the festival with a bang for sure,\u201d said Kim Yutani, the festival\u2019s director of programming. \u201cWe felt that was important to have something that just really just directly reflects what we have been through this past year.\u201d\u201cIn the Same Breath,\u201d she said, is a \u201csearch for the truth. And it is a bold indictment of the response of leadership in China and the US.\u201d Questlove\u2019s film uses never-before-seen footage that had been sitting in a basement for 50 years. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible debut from a first-time director, a vitally important historical document and it\u2019s a kind of reclaiming of history to reframe the present,\u201d said Tabitha Jackson, the director of the festival. \u201cBut most important of all for us was just that it\u2019s a stunning watch. It is joyful and vibrant and colorful and socially engaging and so beautifully crafted and put together.\u201dOpening night will also see the premiere of Sian Heder\u2019s film \u201cCODA,\u201d about the hearing child of deaf parents co-starring Marlee Matlin.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be one of the big stories out of the festival this year,\u201d Yutani said. In addition to \u201cCODA,\u201d the U.S. Dramatic Competition section will feature films with Tiffany Haddish and Jerrod Carmichael (\u201cOn the Count of Three) and Ruth Negga and Tessa Thompson who co-star in \u201cPassing,\u201d about two light-skinned Black women who choose to live on opposite sides of the color line in 1929 New York. Based on a novella by Nella Larsen, \u201cPassing\u201d is the directorial debut of actor Rebecca Hall. \u201cThe way that Rebecca has directed it feels utterly contemporary,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt really speaks to this current moment.\u201dADVERTISEMENTRobin Wright is also making her directorial debut with \u201cLand,\u201d about a search for meaning in the American wilderness after an \u201cunfathomable event\u201d starring herself and Demi\u00e1n Bichir. There are high-profile documentaries about \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d author Amy Tan and EGOT-winning actor Rita Moreno. Yutani said that the Sesame Street documentary, \u201cStreet Gang: How We Got To Sesame Street\u201d is likely to be a crowd favorite. Edgar Wright has also directed a documentary about the pop rock duo Sparks.And there are others that might not have the flashy celebrity subjects but are gems worth checking out. One, Jackson said, is \u201cWriting With Fire\u201d about India\u2019s only newspaper run by Dalit women, who are breaking traditions and norms to tell the truth about what is happening to women in the country. Another is about the legal trailblazer Pauli Murray, who influenced Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Thurgood Marshall from \u201cRGB\u201d directors Julie Cohen and Betsy West.As always, Sundance is a festival of discovery spotlighting new and emerging voices in film. Over half of the feature films this year are from first-time directors and across the 140 total projects, 50% were directed by one or more women and 51% by one or more artists of color.The 2020 Sundance Film Festival was home to some of this year\u2019s most acclaimed films, including \u201cPromising Young Woman,\u201d \u201cMinari,\u201d \u201cNever Rarely Sometimes Always,\u201d \u201cBoys State,\u201d \u201cCrip Camp\u201d and \u201cKajillionaire.\u201d It was also one of the only major festivals to happen before the pandemic hit. \u201cWe were so lucky to be able to go when we did in January, just before the pandemic hit. Other festivals weren\u2019t that lucky and many other filmmakers weren\u2019t as lucky in getting their work buzzed about, written about and seen,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe deeply feel the responsibility this year of doubling down on our commitment to emerging voices.\u201dSundance founder Robert Redford said in a statement that under Jackson\u2019s leadership, \u201cWe\u2019ve forged a new collective vision: one that honors the spirit and tradition of these invigorating yearly gatherings in Utah, while making room for imaginative new possibilities in a new online format.\u201dThe festival \u201cgoing virtual\u201d also opens up the experience to curious audiences who may not have had the time or money to make it out to Park City, which between lodging, food and passes can be an expensive endeavor. \u201cWe all are so excited about the possibility of encountering people who\u2019ve never been to the festival,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSuddenly, people from around the country and around the world can be at Sundance for the first time, be part of that first audience who can talk about this work which will in some ways define the conversation around cinema in the 12 months afterwards.\u201dTickets for the 2021 edition go on sale on Jan. 7. \u2014-Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr "}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/52e3b278f89053b318991b5db3992ba3", "headline": "Illinois infant with COVID-19 dies, cause of death unknown | AP News", "date": "2020-03-28T21:40:58Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 An Illinois infant with COVID-19 has died, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Saturday. The cause of death is unknown and an investigation is underway.A state employee also was among 13 new deaths reported Saturday, as Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike urged people to do all they can to prevent the spread of the virus.\u201cIf you haven\u2019t been paying attention, maybe this is your wake-up call,\u201d Ezike said. The risk of death and severe illness from COVID-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. ADVERTISEMENTChildren have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with COVID-19. The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure, and died four weeks after being hospitalized. Separate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year old. The study found less than 6% of children were seriously ill. LATESTIllinois reported 465 new cases on Saturday and 13 deaths, including a state employee who worked for the Department of Human Services. Six of the deaths, including the infant, were in Cook County, which includes Chicago. The others were in counties surrounding Chicago: McHenry, Kane, Lake and Will. Other than the child, a McHenry County man in his 50s was the youngest person to die. The new numbers bring Illinois\u2019 total cases to 3,491, including 47 deaths, in 43 of Illinois\u2019 102 counties. The state said 25,429 people had been tested as of Saturday afternoon. Pritzker urged people to follow his stay-at-home order and practice social distancing when outside of their home, and said new shopping procedures will be starting, such as announcements in stores reminding shoppers to keep six feet apart and a temporary ban on reusable bags. He also McCormick Place Convention Center in Chicago will serve as Illinois\u2019 first \u201cfield hospital.\u201d On Friday, the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 commander, Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, told reporters the corps is setting up beds to accommodate about 3,000 patients at the convention center, and will be ready by April 24.\u201cWe\u2019re not waiting of the worst,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing ourselves for the worst.\u201d SCHOOLSThe Illinois State Board of Education late Friday set new guidelines for schools as it seems more likely remote learning and other changes will continue further into the academic year. The board said districts must implement remote learning plans for all schools starting Tuesday. Districts may use online or non-digital learning, such as giving out homework packets, but must find ways to engage students.ADVERTISEMENTPritzker has suspended state-mandated standardized testing, including the SAT, which is widely used for college admissions. The state board said it\u2019s working on options to allow high school juniors to take the SAT in the fall. It also said districts should adopt a grading system of \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cincomplete,\u201d and students should be allowed to make up or do assignments over. Pritzker originally ordered schools closed through March but has extended the order through at least April 7 as the state tried to get a handle on the pandemic by issuing a stay-at-home order through the same day. Chicago Public Schools suspended in-person classes at least through April 20. Both Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot have said they do not know when schools may be able to reopen, but Lightfoot predicted Friday that Pritzker\u2019s stay-at-home order will last \u201cdeep into April.\u201d SMART 911Lightfoot asked Chicago residents on Saturday to sign up for a \u201cSmart 911\u201d system that allows people to let police, fire and emergency medical crews know that they are under quarantine or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. Lightfoot said the free service will help keep crews responding to emergencies safe and healthy.People also can include other information they may want first responders to have in case of an emergency, such as health conditions or whether they are are hard of hearing or deaf. Those who are quarantined can use the Smart911 app on a cellphone to receive messages checking on their health status. ___ Associated Press Health Writer Matthew Perrone in Washington contributed.

Now, the 62-year-old teacher is a frequent flier, traveling every few months to Tijuana, Mexico, to buy medication for rheumatoid arthritis \u2014 with tickets paid for by the state of Utah\u2019s public insurer.Lovell is one of about 10 state workers participating in a year-old program to lower prescription drug costs by having public employees buy their medication in Mexico at a steep discount compared to U.S. prices. The program appears to be the first of its kind, and is a dramatic example of steps states are taking to alleviate the high cost of prescription drugs.ADVERTISEMENTIn one long, exhausting day, Lovell flies from Salt Lake City to San Diego. There, an escort picks her up and takes her across the border to a Tijuana hospital, where she gets a refill on her prescription. After that, she\u2019s shuttled back to the airport and heads home. Lovell had been paying $450 in co-pays every few months for her medication, though she said it would have increased to some $2,400 if she had not started traveling to Mexico. Without the program, she would not be able to afford the medicine she needs.\u201cThis is the drug that keeps me functioning, working,\u201d said Lovell, who works at an early-intervention program for deaf students that\u2019s part of the Utah Schools for the Deaf and Blind. \u201cI think if I wasn\u2019t on this drug ... I\u2019d be on disability rather than living my normal life.\u201dThe cost difference is so large that the state\u2019s insurance program for public employees can pay for each patient\u2019s flight, give them a $500-per-trip bonus and still save tens of thousands of dollars. Other states have taken new approaches to addressing the high costs of prescription drugs. California is looking at launching its own generic-drug label. Louisiana has a Netflix-style program for hepatitis C drugs, where the state negotiated a deal to pay a flat fee rather than for each prescription. Several states are looking at creating boards aimed at keeping prices affordable, and four have started what\u2019s expected to be a lengthy process to begin importing drugs from Canada under a new Trump administration plan.The Utah program was created under a 2018 state law dubbed \u201cright to shop,\u201d by Republican Rep. Norm Thurston. The Public Employees Health Program offers it only for people who use a drug on a list of about a dozen medications where the state can get significant savings. Of the 160,000 state and local public employees covered by the insurer, fewer  than 400 are eligible, according to Managing Director Chet Loftis. ADVERTISEMENTOfficials have tracked the medications from the manufacturer to the pharmacy to the patient, to make sure people are getting the same drugs they would at home, he said. They contract with a specialty pharmacy that works with one of the region\u2019s largest private hospital systems. A representative from a company, Provide Rx, escorts patients from the San Diego airport to Hospital Angeles in Tijuana and back across the border. Lovell has a prescription from her doctor in Utah, and each time she travels to Mexico she sees a doctor at the hospital as well. She updates the doctor on her condition, gets her prescription, and takes it to the pharmacist, who gives her the medication. Provide Rx also works with a dozen or so private companies, some of whom offer similar bonus programs to their staffers, said general manager Javier Ojeda.Just over a year after the program began, the state has saved about $225,000, Loftis said.Though the number of people participating is relatively small, the savings add up quickly. The annual U.S. list price for the drug Lovell takes, Enbrel, is over $62,000 per patient. With the Mexico program, after the cost of the flight and the bonus, the state still cuts its expenses in half. \u201cIt makes sense for us to do this,\u201d Loftis said. Thurston had hoped more people would sign up, saving the state $1 million by now. But officials are optimistic more people will sign on now that they see the program is working. They have expanded to offering flights to Canada, where there\u2019s a clinic in the Vancouver airport and the travel costs are about the same. While importation of prescription drugs is illegal because drugs sold in other countries haven\u2019t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. allows people to bring in a three-month supply for personal use.There have been long been more informal trips across the border elsewhere; Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has taken bus trips with patients from border states into Canada to highlight the cost of prescription drugs. But the Utah program appears to be the only formal state program of its kind, said David Mitchell, a cancer patient and the founder of the advocacy group Patients For Affordable Drugs.\u201cIt is unfortunate and, in fact, wrong that the citizens of this great country have to travel to other countries to get drugs they need at affordable prices,\u201d he said. Others say the \u201cpharmaceutical tourism\u201d approach has risks and doesn\u2019t solve the issue of high prescription drug prices in the United States. Peter Maybarduk with the nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen said people can come across unsafe medications in other countries, and it\u2019s important not to undercut the importance of U.S. regulators. \u201cIt is a Band-Aid for people who really need it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need reform of the system as whole.\u201dIn most other countries, national health programs negotiate lower drug prices at large scale, and sometimes refuse to cover the most expensive ones. Meanwhile, patents generally run much longer in the U.S. than other countries, allowing for monopolies. Drug makers also often point to the high cost of creating a drug to bring to market. Utah truck driver Jason Pierce has been grateful to find the drug Stelara, the only effective treatment for his psoriasis. It\u2019s also expensive, so he and his wife, a Utah health department employee, started traveling to Mexico to get his shots. Their insurance through her state job covers it completely, so the trips don\u2019t save them any money. But with both flights covered through the state program and the $500 bonuses, they can make a short vacation. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy,\u201d he said. The drug is \u201cexactly the same.\u201dAnd the travel means the drug saves their public insurer thousands, helping save taxpayer money and bring down premiums, his wife, Robbin Williams, said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s the moral and right thing to do,\u201d she said.___Follow Whitehurst on Twitter: https://twitter.com/lwhitehurst"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/new-york-sidney-crosby-north-america-new-york-rangers-nhl-1ccc68873eee0aaf7625d2272c490a53", "headline": "NY Rangers select Lafreniere with No. 1 pick in NHL draft | AP News", "date": "2020-10-07T06:45:45Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "Alexis Lafreniere wanted to take the stage at Montreal\u2019s Bell Centre near his home and hear his name announced at the NHL draft.The playmaking forward had to settle for being selected first overall by the New York Rangers on Tuesday night.\u201cObviously, it\u2019s different, and we didn\u2019t expect that a couple of months ago,\u201d Lafreniere said. \u201cGrowing up, you\u2019re dreaming of being drafted. And for me today, it\u2019s amazing to go first. I\u2019m really honored.\u201dLafreniere was the NHL Central Scouting Bureau\u2019s top-ranked North American skater. The 6-foot-1 left wing becomes the first Canadian to go No. 1 since Connor McDavid was chosen by Edmonton in 2015. From suburban Montreal, he was the first to earn both Canadian Hockey League and Quebec Major Junior Hockey League MVP honors in consecutive seasons since Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby in 2004 and \u201905.ADVERTISEMENTIn a sign of the unusual nature of this year\u2019s remote draft amid the coronavirus pandemic, Lafreniere spoke by video call from a bedroom in his home. Rather than walking up on stage and having a team official provide his new jersey, Lafreniere stood up from a living room chair, gave his sport jacket to his sister and pulled on a Rangers hat and No. 20 Rangers jersey handed to him by his father.\u201cToday, I woke up and I was really excited and I just got ready for the pick,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just a little speechless.\u201dRangers general manager Jeff Gorton, who spent the weeks leading up to the draft refusing to tip his hand, laughed in revealing when he knew he was going to select Lafreniere.\u201cI think when the ball came out of the machine, we knew he was going to be our guy,\u201d Gorton said. \u201cIt was pretty clear cut how we felt about him.\u201dThe Rangers bucked the odds by jumping ahead of the NHL\u2019s seven non-playoff teams to win the draft lottery after being swept by Carolina in the preliminary round in August. The Los Angeles Kings then selected Ontario Hockey League center Quinton Byfield with the second pick. The 6-foot-4 Byfield, whose father moved to Canada from Jamaica, became the highest drafted Black player.\u201cMy dad and mom didn\u2019t play hockey,\u201d Byfield said. \u201cIt just shows that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for everyone in the world.\u201dThe Ottawa Senators were next and chose top-ranked international forward Tim Stuetzle, who played professionally in his native Germany last year, with their first of three first-round selections.Detroit, which was bumped to the fourth spot despite finishing with the league\u2019s worst record, selected Swedish forward Lucas Raymond. A little over an hour before the draft, the Red Wings announced general manager Steve Yzerman had to self-isolate in overseeing the draft separate from his staff after coming into contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19.It was an NHL draft like no other, the first one held in October, with teams selecting remotely from their home cities.\u201cJeopardy\u201d game-show host Alex Trebek announced Ottawa\u2019s first pick in the form of a question. \u201cAnd the answer is, Tim Stuetzle,\u201d Trebek said.Commissioner Gary Bettman was busy putting on and pulling off his protective mask in introducing the next team\u2019s selection from the NHL Network studios in New Jersey. North Dakota freshman Jake Sanderson, who went No. 5 to Ottawa, was joined by his family in watching the draft from a suite at the school\u2019s Ralph Engelstad Arena. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy and surreal,\u201d said Sanderson, the son of former NHL forward Geoff Sanderson, and the first American and defenseman selected. \u201cIt was a little bit of a different draft this year. But I think it\u2019s kind of special in its own way.\u201dThe San Jose Sharks closed out the first round by selecting forward Ozzy Wiesblatt, with scouting director Doug Wilson Jr. using sign language in a message to the player\u2019s mother who is deaf.\u201cTo see the picks, and to see the reactions by the families, it was all there. It was a very special night,\u201d Rangers president John Davidson said. \u201cAll these things made the whole draft so human.\u201dThe top 10 selections featured five Canadians, one American, and four Europeans, including center Marco Rossi, who became the fifth Austrian-born player to be chosen in the top 10 when he went ninth overall to Minnesota. Overall, 19 of the 31 selections were Canadian-born players, matching the most since 2003 when the NHL had 30 teams. Russia\u2019s Iaroslav Askarov became just the eighth goalie selected in the first round since 2010, after being chosen No. 11 by Nashville. At 17, Askarov made 23 saves in a 4-2 win for SKA St. Petersburg in becoming the second-youngest goalie to play a Kontinental Hockey League game last November.The Washington Capitals traded the 24th and 80th picks to Calgary to move up and select Quebec junior center Hendrix Lapierre at No. 22. Once considered a top-10 prospect, concerns were raised after the Chicoutimi player sustained three concussions from Feb. 6 to Nov. 21, 2019. He was diagnosed with a spinal injury before being cleared to play in April.\u201cRight now I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a risk any more, but I had a really tough season last year with the injuries,\u201d Lapierre said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s the cherry on the sundae.\u201dThe draft concludes Wednesday with rounds second through seven, before teams turn their attention to the NHL\u2019s free agency signing period, which opens Friday.___AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.___For more AP NHL coverage: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/business-product-safety-us-consumer-product-safety-commission-6c8b8ea06c37ccd53754f8be78e08caf", "headline": "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) Posts ...", "date": "2020-01-10T02:10:08Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1973 and charged with protecting the American public from unreasonable risks of serious injury or death from more than 15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction.

(AP) \u2014 Kansas\u2019 governor and its top public health official said Thursday that they worry that the state won\u2019t be able to reopen its K-12 schools for the new school year in August if it doesn\u2019t reverse a recent surge in reported coronavirus cases.Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly told legislative leaders that a desire to reopen schools is a key reason for her executive order requiring Kansas residents to wear masks in public and their workplaces. The order takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday, with a fine of up to $2,500 possible for violators.\u201cThe trend is going in the wrong direction,\u201d Kelly said during a meeting to review her order. \u201cIf we continue that way, we will not be able to open our schools for in-classroom learning in the fall.\u201dADVERTISEMENTKelly and other state officials don\u2019t expect strict enforcement with decisions about pursuing violations left up to prosecutors in each of the state\u2019s 105 counties. Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican, can pursue violations but said he will leave them to local officials. Also, counties can opt out of the order under a new pandemic law that took effect in June and resulted from a compromise between Kelly and lawmakers. In Sedgwick County, home to Wichita, the state\u2019s largest city, commissioners voted 3-2 Thursday to strongly recommend that people follow Kelly\u2019s order but not make it a mandate. Commissioner Michael O\u2019Donnell, a Republican, compared a mandate to required dress codes for women in \u201cMiddle Eastern countries.\u201d\u201cI just inherently don\u2019t believe that\u2019s American,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. The governor and Dr. Lee Norman, her health secretary, said the goal is to increase people\u2019s use of masks to control the novel coronavirus\u2019 spread. Norman told legislative leaders that Kansas could prevent more than 11,500 new coronavirus cases between now and Oct. 1 with a mask mandate.\u201cThe last thing that we want is to open the schools and hundreds of kids get sick and the schools would have to close,\u201d said House Minority Leader Tom Sawyer, a Wichita Democrat. \u201cWe have to get this under control before schools open.\u201dKelly\u2019s order doesn\u2019t apply to the Legislature\u2019s meetings or to the courts, but the Kansas Supreme Court on Thursday ordered masks to be worn in judicial proceedings.The governor lifted statewide restrictions  on businesses and public gatherings and allowed counties to set their own rules on May 26 after weeks of complaints from GOP lawmakers that she was moving too slowly to reopen the economy.ADVERTISEMENTAnd conservative Republican legislative leaders said her mask order violates personal liberties and creates confusion about what activities were allowed without masks. Kelly\u2019s chief lawyer acknowledged that maskless baseball games are likely to be allowed while pickup basketball games might require face coverings. Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican, said people would have responded better to public service announcements.\u201cThey\u2019re very resentful of a mandate that comes down with an iron fist,\u201d Wagle said. State officials did receive good coronavirus-related news Thursday. Tax collections in June, about $744 million, exceeded the state\u2019s official forecast by nearly $136 million, or 22.3%.The state had slashed revenue projections in April to account for the economic slump that followed the shuttering of businesses, leaving a projected shortfall in the current budget.Kansas has reported nearly 15,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus since the pandemic started in early March and 272 COVID-19-related deaths as of Wednesday. Since Kelly lifted statewide restrictions on businesses and public gatherings immediately after Memorial Day, Kansas has had 5,653 new confirmed COVID-19 cases, a 61% increase, and 84 additional deaths \u2014 a 45% jump.In Johnson County in the Kansas City area, the state\u2019s most populous county, county commissioners voted 4-2 Thursday to follow the governor\u2019s mandate, The Kansas City Star reported. Neighboring Wyandotte County and Douglas County, home to the main University of Kansas campus, already mandated masks.Shawnee County commissioners voted 3-0 to delay restricting bars to operating seven hours a day and closing at 10 p.m., until Tuesday, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. The county health officer had ordered the restrictions to start Thursday.Norman said if the growth in Kansas coronavirus cases doesn\u2019t start to decline this month, reopening schools won\u2019t be safe. Kelly closed all of the state\u2019s K-12 buildings in March, moving the state\u2019s 519,000 public school students largely to online learning. \nThe governor\u2019s latest order says Kansas residents must wear masks in indoor public spaces, while seeking health care or using public transportation. It also says people must wear them outdoors in public when they can\u2019t remain at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) from others. Businesses must require employees to wear masks in places frequented by the public or if they prepare food.The requirement would not apply to children under 6, the deaf, or people with medical conditions that make breathing through a mask difficult or who can\u2019t remove a mask without assistance.___Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/shootings-police-pennsylvania-philadelphia-theft-2f1207e7f4a4f4ee12f5fcdfad899fa3", "headline": "Lawyer: Mom, child trapped in crowd when police smashed car | AP ...", "date": "2020-10-30T21:03:44Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Philadelphia officials plan to release the police body camera footage Wednesday of the encounter that led officers to fatally shoot Walter Wallace Jr., the latest in a line of police killings of Black people to roil the U.S. this year. The announcement came as National Guard soldiers arrived in town Friday to help control the unrest and monitor the contentious election Tuesday; the city reinstated an overnight curfew; and new details emerged about a harrowing video that shows police smashing in the windows of a vehicle driven by a Black woman who found herself trapped during the demonstrations with her toddler in a rear car seat.ADVERTISEMENTThe National FOP posted a picture of the small boy in the arms of a female police officer after his mother was detained, saying he had been found wandering around barefoot during the protests. The post was soon taken down.\u201cJust imagine the vitriol she\u2019s getting on social media about what kind of a parent she is? How could she be out there? It\u2019s infuriating,\u201d said lawyer Kevin Mincey, who represents home health aide Rickia Young.Young, 28, had been watching the late news Monday night when she saw that protests over Wallace\u2019s death had broken out in West Philadelphia. She decided to retrieve her 16-year-old nephew from the area, and put her 2-year-old son in the car, lest she leave him home alone. She also hoped the toddler might finally fall asleep.Young took her usual route home only to drive into the fray at about 1:45 a.m. as police clashed with demonstrators. Police told her to turn around. But as she attempted a K-turn, he said, officers swarmed her car, broke windows and injured her and her nephew as they pulled them from the vehicle.Young spent the next few hours at police headquarters and at a hospital, as she was bruised and bleeding from the head. She asked her mother to try to find the child, who had been pulled from the vehicle by police. The grandmother finally found him in a police cruiser, with a welt on his head and glass in his car seat, Mincey said. Both Young and the boy, who is hearing impaired, are traumatized, Mincey said. The FOP post, he said, painted \u201cofficers as heroes of the community, when in actuality, they were the terrorists of this incident.\u201dNational FOP spokesperson Jessica Cahill said the post was taken down when it \u201csubsequently learned of conflicting accounts of the circumstances.\u201d She did not immediately say where the FOP got the initial information.ADVERTISEMENTMincey, unlike many who watched the video, is not surprised by the footage. He represents some of the protesters arrested in Philadelphia during Black Lives Matter demonstrations earlier this year.\u201cThis is how they respond,\u201d Mincey said of police. \u201cReally, it\u2019s just a continuation of what we\u2019ve seen this summer \u2014 violence, intimidation and them trying to assert their will by force over people who are lawfully on the streets.\u201d\u201cThe problem now is all the eyes trained on it,\u201d the lawyer said.Young was never charged, although a bracelet put on her arm at police headquarters suggested she was detained for allegedly assaulting police, he said.She plans to file a civil rights lawsuit against the city. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, at a press conference Friday, called the video \u201cquite concerning,\u201d but said she couldn\u2019t say much more. She said one officer seen striking the vehicle has been put on restricted duty while an internal investigation plays out.The city has meanwhile seen a spate of mischief and mayhem along with the protests this week, as an estimated 1,000 people broke into stores to steal merchandise this week, 50 police were injured and 22 attempts made to steal ATM machines, often through the use of low-grade explosives like the ones found in a van Wednesday night. \u201cPhiladelphians are experiencing an immense amount of pain, and significant unrest persists throughout the entire city,\u201d city officials said Friday in a statement issued jointly with the district attorney and the Wallace family. The parties said they hoped \u201cthat releasing the recordings on November 4 will provide enough time to calm tensions and for the recordings to be released in the most constructive manner possible.\u201dA wake and funeral for Wallace has been scheduled for Nov. 7. His family had called 911 on Monday for both medical services and police as he went through a mental health crisis, but only the latter arrived, family lawyer Shaka Johnson said Thursday. Less than 30 seconds into the encounter, Wallace was dead, felled by a blast of 14 bullets, he said.Police have said the two officers fired after Wallace ignored orders to drop a knife. Wallace\u2019s mother and wife were outside, shouting to police about his mental health problems, Johnson said.The family does not want the officers charged with murder, but Johnson stopped short of saying if other charges should be filed.

Well, House lawmakers skipped the joyous tradition of tossing papers in the air when they finally adjourned Friday night as they tried to limit janitors\u2019 exposure to the virus.That\u2019s just one small example of how new and much more pressing problems crowded in on typical legislative rhythms.Gov. Brian Kemp had been highlighting his opposition to gangs and human trafficking and his advocacy for teacher pay raises and protecting patients from unexpected medical bills before lawmakers hightailed it out of town in March. House Speaker David Ralston had been maneuvering toward an additional cut to Georgia\u2019s top income tax rate and had crafted a package of other initiatives that was meant to give his suburban Atlanta members a chance to run as moderates against Democratic challengers.ADVERTISEMENTWhen members of the General Assembly gathered again June, some of plans were already in ruin because of nosediving state tax revenues. Protesters were marching to the Capitol to demand that action on racial injustice and voting problems. Much of the original legislation still passed, but the spotlight was on other things.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re driving down the highway and you stop,\u201d said Senate President Pro Tem Butch Miller, a Gainesville Republican. \u201cAnd you just sit there and we waited, and then we finally got back in the car, and we gave it the gas and went wide open again.\u201dThis second act quickly rose to a climax over efforts to push a bill imposing further penalties on hate crimes through the Senate. \u201cI think the common denominator, between the two \u2014 the pre COVID-break and the resumed session \u2014 is that what\u2019s happening in the General Assembly is reflective of the fact that Georgia is a highly competitive political environment,\u201d said House Minority Leader Bob Trammell, a Luthersville Democrat.Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan proposed his own hate-crimes measure. But even as liberal critics lampooned it for trying to protect categories like culture, Duncan\u2019s own Republican caucus shelved his plan and instead moved to try to create hate-crimes protections for police.That move threatened to melt down the session, with multiple Senate Democrats speaking in public in tears. Duncan gets credit for helping smooth things out. Senators split the new protections for police into a different bill. Its passage was bitter medicine for Democrats, underlining key differences on how the two parties view the role of police in society. ADVERTISEMENTStill, both sides hailed the agreement on a hate-crimes bill as a triumph of bipartisanship.\u201cIf we take the lessons of what we learned this past two weeks, we will be a better Georgia General Assembly,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Harold Jones II, an Augusta Democrat, \u201cI honestly believe that.\u201dThe fallout from a primary election disrupted by long lines and troubles with Georgia\u2019s new voting machines devolved into a cold war between Ralston and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger over the latter\u2019s decision to mail absentee ballots to all of Georgia\u2019s active voters. Ralston\u2019s efforts to clip Raffensperger\u2019s wings came to naught, with Democrats highlighting them to argue that Republicans systematically seek to exclude voters.Kemp played one key role, agreeing to let lawmakers spend $250 million from the state\u2019s savings account to blunt the worst of the budget cuts. But 10% reductions are still steep, even if the state manages to avoid furloughing employees. Democrats argued that Georgia should raise tobacco taxes or eliminate tax breaks, but Republicans were deaf to those pleas.\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like there was a whole lot of willingness to talk about the future,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Steve Henson, a Stone Mountain Democrat. \u201cYou know we\u2019ve been underfunding state government for a long time.\u201dLawmakers exit the Gold Dome firmly pointed toward the November elections. Democrats hope to gain the 16 seats needed to flip the House, which would give them control of part of Georgia\u2019s government for the first time since 2004. Ralston\u2019s efforts this year, such as expanding Medicaid coverage for new mothers to six months after the birth of a child, have been clearly aimed at averting that.\u201cThe Republicans in the House are interested in bipartisan solutions to the issues that matter to Georgians,\u201d Ralston said. \u201cI think we can run on maternal mortality. That\u2019s a serious problem here in Georgia, we address that in a very aggressive way.\u201dThat might have been enough before the COVID-19 intermission. But in the new world of steep budget cuts and Democrats energized over voting problems and racial injustice, it may not be enough now.___Follow Jeff Amy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffamy."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/caracas-colombia-latin-america-united-states-south-america-28f631bab4f954ce62835a7c66593609", "headline": "Top US diplomat finds virtual path into Venezuela amid rift | AP News", "date": "2020-06-15T04:04:53Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 A year after shutting down the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, Washington\u2019s top diplomat in Venezuela has found a way to slip back inside the South American nation \u2014 at least virtually. \nEach Thursday afternoon, James Story hits the \u201cGo Live\u201d button on Facebook from his office in the U.S. Embassy in Bogota or his home in the Colombian capital hundreds of miles from Caracas. In a freewheeling approach, he answers questions in fluent Spanish from Venezuelans and the few U.S. citizens still in the country, addressing the latest intrigue and turmoil bubbling over in Venezuela and the United States. He occasionally breaks into English with a South Carolina accent. ADVERTISEMENT\nFor 30 minutes, Story talks about everything from Venezuela\u2019s purchases of gasoline from Iran, despite its vast oil reserves, to recent unrest in the U.S. over George Floyd\u2019s death in police custody to accusations that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is undermining Venezuela\u2019s constitution.\n\u201cLook, this is not a true democracy,\u201d Story said in a recent session, later railing against high-ranking Venezuelan officials whose families live lavishly in Spain and Panama while most Venezuelans are in poverty. \u201cYes, they\u2019re cheating all of you.\u201d\nStory\u2019s low-budget, weekly question-and-answer session on the popular social media platform is an unusual approach to outreach for explaining U.S. policy on Venezuela, which has so far failed to oust Maduro. \nThe cyber-diplomacy is a way for Story to get his message out since he\u2019s deprived of traditional tools such as visiting hospitals and schools, talking to local reporters and hosting cocktail parties for power brokers. \nStory\u2019s live chat sessions are part of duties that include leading a team of diplomats for the highly unusual \u201c virtual embassy \u201d working out of the mission in neighboring Colombia.\nWilliam Brownfield, who waged his own battles as a U.S. ambassador against the late Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, said using the video chat to bridge the divide between Venezuela and Colombia is an \u201cexceptionally clever\u201d solution.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has been trying to do, it\u2019s cut off any direct communication with his base by the U.S. government, or anybody who doesn\u2019t agree with him,\u201d Brownfield said in an interview from Washington. \nBrownfield, who is now retired, served as ambassador to Venezuela for three years starting in 2004. His signature approach to diplomacy \u2014 admitting he had the advantage of working inside its borders \u2014 was handing out baseball bats and gloves to youth teams in Caracas\u2019 poorest neighborhood.

Story can also communicate his message to other foreign diplomats, many cautious about what they can say while still inside Venezuela, he said. \n\u201cHe\u2019s saying things out loud that they cannot say,\u201d Brownfield said.\nStory and his team of fellow diplomats lowered the flag at the U.S. Embassy in March 2019, just a couple months after President Donald Trump recognized opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader. The U.S. is among more than 50 nations that accuse Maduro of clinging to power following an undemocratic election in 2018 that banned the most popular opposition politicians. \nThe U.S. has since heavily sanctioned Maduro, his inner circle and the state-run oil firm, attempting to isolate them. The Trump administration recently offered a $15 million bounty for Maduro\u2019s arrest after a U.S. court indicted him as a narcoterrorist.\nStory, whose career has taken him to Mexico, Brazil, Mozambique and Afghanistan, serves as the embassy\u2019s charge d\u2019affairs, a diplomat who heads a mission in the absence of the ambassador. The U.S. and Venezuela haven\u2019t exchanged ambassadors in a decade. \nTrump nominated Story in May to serve as the ambassador to Venezuela, days after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told his staff to start planning to reopen the embassy in Caracas as part of a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign anticipating what they hope will be Maduro\u2019s imminent departure. \nStory, who declined to comment for this article, launched the Facebook Live chat in April, later adding a sign-language interpreter. Each week it draws a few hundred live viewers, while the archived videos continue to attract clicks, one garnering 315,000 views. \nThe majority of Story\u2019s viewers post questions that scroll up the page as he talks. Some plead for help to obtain asylum or visas so they can reunite with relatives in the U.S. Others invite the U.S. to invade and put an end to Maduro\u2019s rule. Few are critical of the U.S. role, despite Story often urging tough questions from those who disagree with him. \nAt least one of Story\u2019s Facebook Live comments appears to have reached Maduro\u2019s ears.\nFollowing a failed attack in early May that landed two ex-U.S. special forces soldiers in a Venezuelan prison, Story said that the U.S. government had no role, rather backing a peaceful solution through dialogue. He noted that U.S. forces had tracked down al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and if Washington wanted Maduro taken out by force, he would no longer be in power.\nMaduro fired back an hour later in an interview aired on state TV, citing Story\u2019s \u201cdispatches\u201d from Bogota. He said the U.S. diplomat\u2019s role sending the \u201cmercenaries\u201d was undeniable.\n\u201cJames Story is responsible for this failed armed raid,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cJames Story has his feet, his hands and his whole body in this armed raid.\u201d \n___\nFollow Scott Smith on Twitter: @ScottSmithAP \n___\nAssociated Press writer Jorge Rueda contributed to this report. \n"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-education-music-utah-immigration-bd82630fa4e0d173b71f87aacb444ba8", "headline": "Top teacher hopes more equitable system follows pandemic | AP ...", "date": "2020-10-03T16:14:17Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 A self-described \u201cshy Korean boy,\u201d John Arthur credits his junior high and high school teachers for helping him find his voice.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for them, one, I might not have made it through high school, but two, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be a teacher and I wouldn\u2019t have the guts to say anything that\u2019s on my mind or my heart,\u201d said Arthur, addressing the Utah State Board of Education Thursday, moments after being name Utah\u2019s 2021 Teacher of the Year.ADVERTISEMENTNow in his eighth year of teaching, Arthur teaches sixth grade at Meadowlark Elementary School, a Title I school in the Salt Lake City School District.

This is as close as I\u2019m ever going to get so I\u2019m glad she gets to see it,\u201d Arthur said.While Arthur, who is teaching online as the Salt Lake City School District is solely offering remote instruction to start the school year, joked about his attire, he used his new platform to advocate for a more equitable education system.\u201cThis is the perfect moment for us to think about what a nation should look like when this is all said and done, because we need to take care of each during this terrible time but also start planning and putting into place the steps that we need to to create a more equitable educational system,\u201d he said.\u201cWe should be doing everything we can, as we think about how we get our kids connected now. We also need to remember the students that were pushed out beforehand. We need to make sure that the school-to-prison pipeline is such a pre-COVID thing and makes no sense in the future,\u201d said Arthur.Arthur serves on the State School Board\u2019s advisory committee on equity of educational services for students.ADVERTISEMENTHe also addressed the challenges of teaching school during a global pandemic.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to feel confident or sure about anything when everything feels conflicted and mixed up. I am both incredibly excited about the future of education, especially here in Utah, but also terrified of our present moment,\u201d he said.Arthur said he worried that he would feel disconnected from his students teaching online.Instead, it\u2019s pushed him out into the neighborhoods to \u201cfind them and reach out to them in order to make things work. I\u2019ve done more home visits and called more parents and sent more texts and emails in the last seven months than I have in seven years.\u201dHe and his students may be physically distanced, but \u201cI feel in a lot of ways more connected as a teacher to my community than I have before.\u201dOrdinarily, Utah\u2019s teacher of the year is announced at a banquet. But in the midst of the pandemic, that wasn\u2019t possible.State Superintendent of Public Instruction Sydnee Dickson popped into Arthur\u2019s classroom Thursday morning to inform him he had been selected as Utah\u2019s 2021 Teacher of the Year, presenting him an oversized check for $10,000.As she entered his classroom, Arthur was in the middle of an online lesson.\u201cHe was so worried about making sure that they (his students) were being taught while they were on. It was amazing to watch him manage everything while we were punking him,\u201d Dickson said.Arthur said Dickson\u2019s visit was a \u201cwarm and incredible surprise this morning but I\u2019m incredibly grateful. I\u2019m proud to bring this back to the Salt Lake City School District and Meadowlark Elementary.\u201dArthur said he owes the recognition to five women: his wife, Stacey, his mother-in-law SuAnn Cannon who cares for their children while the couple works, his mom, Suka, and his current and former principals, Maggie Cummings and Heidi Greene. The Arthurs have two young daughters.Arthur, who was a military brat who lived on Fort Douglas as a child, is a graduate of Brighton High School. His father was a military officer who met his mother when he was serving in Korea. The family moved to Utah when Arthur was about 8 years old.Arthur credits his teachers for taking a personal interest in him and supporting him after his grandmother, who lived with his family, died.\u201cI stopped going to school in the middle of my junior year. Before that I was taking AP classes. I was a model student in most ways. But after my grandma passed away and some other things, I just sort of lost sight of any meaning in any of this. I just stopped going,\u201d he said.Brighton High social studies teacher Jim Hodges supported Arthur, he said. Instead of judging him for his frequent absences and occasional obnoxious behavior, he asked, \u201cAre you OK?\u201dIt\u2019s something Arthur\u2019s adopted in his own teaching, he said \u2014 checking in with his students and \u201ctreating kids like they are complicated and also humans.\u201dHe knows it can make a difference between a student reaching their goals and falling between the cracks.For Arthur, completing high school went \u201cdown to the wire. I had to do packets and everything else and now I\u2019m Utah Teacher of the Year. Go figure.\u201dAfter earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in English from the University of Utah, Arthur worked as a substitute teacher and discovered his passion for working with children.

No trip was ever confirmed, however, and it\u2019s not clear how increased instability in Iraq might affect Vatican planning. But Francis made clear the American strike and Iran\u2019s response to it was worrisome in the volatile region.\u201cParticularly troubling are the signals coming from the entire region following the heightening of tensions between Iran and the United States, which risk above all compromising the gradual process of rebuilding in Iraq, as well as setting the groundwork for a vaster conflict that all of us would want to avert,\u201d Francis told the ambassadors in the frescoed Sala Regia. \u201cI therefore renew my appeal that all the interested parties avoid an escalation of the conflict and keep alive the flame of dialogue and self-restrain in full respect of international law.\u201dFrancis opened his remarks by praising the hope of young people, particularly as they take the lead in demanding greater attention to the threat of climate change.Francis has made caring for the environment a pillar of his papacy. Vatican officials have praised the global youth movement sparked by Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, who met with Francis last year.In his remarks, Francis lamented with \u201cgrave concern\u201d that international leaders appeared deaf to the cries of the planet, the poor and the young who are demanding faster action to curb global warming. He cited the failure of leaders to approve new rules to reduce carbon emissions at a Madrid climate conference last month.ADVERTISEMENTThe U.N. conference outcome, he said, \u201craises serious concern about the will of the international community to confront with wisdom and effectiveness the phenomenon of global warming, which demands a collective response capable of placing the common good over particular interests.\u201dFrancis spoke of his record seven foreign trips in 2019, highlighting in particular his call in Japan for a ban on not only the use, but the possession of nuclear weapons. Francis has said he plans to change official Catholic teaching to declare the use and possession of nuclear weapons as \u201cimmoral.\u201d\u201cThe time has come for political leaders to realize that a safer world comes about not by the deterrent possession of powerful means of mass destruction, but rather by the patient efforts of men and women of good will who devote themselves concretely, each in his or her own field, to building a world of peace, solidarity and mutual respect,\u201d he said.___This story corrects the spelling of Greta Thunberg\u2019s latest name."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/3cfc821c6ca1d2a9d0180a1fc0d6bc7d", "headline": "Filmmaker Obayashi, who portrayed war's horrors, dead at 82 | AP ...", "date": "2020-04-11T01:31:59Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Nobuhiko Obayashi, one of Japan\u2019s most prolific filmmakers who devoted his works to depicting war\u2019s horrors and singing the eternal power of movies, has died. He was 82. The official site for his latest film, \u201cLabyrinth of Cinema,\u201d said that Obayashi died late Friday. Obayashi was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2016, and was told he had just a few months. But he continued working, appearing frail and often in a wheelchair. \u201cLabyrinth of Cinema\u201d had been scheduled to be released in Japan on the day of his death. The date has been pushed back because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has closed theaters.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cDirector Obayashi fought his sickness to the day of the scheduled release of his film. Rest in peace, director Obayashi, you who loved films so much you kept on making them,\u201d the announcement said. The film was showcased at the Tokyo International Film Festival last year, which honored him as a \u201ccinematic magician\u201d and screened several of his other works. Obayashi stayed stubbornly true to his core pacifist message through more than 40 movies and thousands of TV shows, commercials and other video.His films have kaleidoscopic, fairy tale-like imagery repeating his trademark motifs of colorful Japanese festivals, dripping blood, marching doll-like soldiers, shooting stars and winding cobblestone roads.\u201cLabyrinth of Cinema\u201d is an homage to filmmaking. Its main characters, young Japanese men who go to an old movie theater but increasingly get sucked into crises, have names emulating Obayashi\u2019s favorite cinematic giants, Francois Truffaut, Mario Bava and Don Seigel.Obayashi\u2019s \u201cMiss Lonely,\u201d released in 1985, was shot in seaside Onomichi, the picturesque town in Hiroshima prefecture where Obayashi grew up and made animation clips by hand.His other popular films include his 1977 \u201cHouse,\u201d a horror comedy about youngsters who amble into a haunted house, and \u201cHanagatami,\u201d released in 2017, another take on his perennial themes of young love and the injustices of war that unfolds in iridescent hues. Obayashi was a trailblazer in the world of Japanese TV commercials, hiring foreign movie stars like Catherine Deneuve and Charles Bronson, highlighted in his slick film work that seemed to symbolize Japan\u2019s postwar modernization. He was born in 1938, and his childhood overlapped with World War II, years remembered for Japan\u2019s aggression and atrocities against its neighbors but also a period during which Japanese people suffered hunger, abuse and mass deaths. His pacifist beliefs were reinforced by his father, an army doctor, who also gave him his first 8-millimeter camera.ADVERTISEMENTHis works lack Hollywood\u2019s action-packed plots and neat finales. Instead, they appear to start from nowhere and end, then start up again, weaving in and out of scenes, often traveling in time.During an Associated Press interview in 2019, Obayashi stressed his belief in the power of movies. Movies like his, he says, ask that important question: Where do you stand?\u201cMovies are not weak,\u201d he said, looking offended at such an idea. \u201cMovies express freedom.\u201dHe said then he was working on another film, while acknowledging he was aware of the limitations of his health, all the work taking longer.At the end of the interview, he said he wanted to demonstrate his lifetime goal for his filmmaking. He showed his hand, three fingers held up in the sign language of \u201cI love you.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s value freedom with all our might. Let\u2019s have no lies,\u201d said Obayashi.Obayashi is survived by his wife Kyoko Obayashi, an actress and film producer, and their daughter Chigumi, an actress. A ceremony to mourn his death was being planned, according to Japanese media, but details were not immediately available.

It\u2019s what we\u2019ve known for decades,\u201d Garabedian said at a Tuesday news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s the blueprint of how to practice child abuse, cover it up, portray yourself as the victim and blame the accusers as being self-serving or greedy or not accurate or mistaken.\u201d___HERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VATICAN\u2019S INVESTIGATION:\u2014 A two-year Vatican investigation of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick found that a series of bishops, cardinals and popes downplayed or dismissed reports that he slept with seminarians, and determined that Pope Francis merely continued his predecessors\u2019 handling of the predator until a former altar boy alleged abuse.\u2014 The 449-page internal investigation was published in a bid to restore credibility to the U.S. and Vatican hierarchies, which have been shattered by the McCarrick scandal.\u2014 A summary of the report puts most of the blame on a dead saint: Pope John Paul II, who appointed McCarrick archbishop of Washington D.C., in 2000, despite having commissioned an inquiry that confirmed he slept with seminarians. The summary says John Paul believed his handwritten denial.\u2014 The report also reveals the previously unknown contents of six anonymous letters accusing McCarrick of pedophilia that were sent to U.S. church leaders in the early 1990s and later forwarded to the Holy See.ADVERTISEMENT\u2014 McCarrick, 90, was defrocked by Francis last year after a Vatican investigation confirmed decades of allegations that the globe-trotting envoy and successful church fundraiser had sexually molested adults as well as children.___HERE\u2019S WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON:1 p.m.Bishop Accountability, which compiles a database of clergy publicly accused of sex abuse, is hailing the Vatican\u2019s report as \u201cthe most significant document on the abuse crisis to come from the Church.\u201d Anne Barrett Doyle is the group\u2019s co-director. She says that \u201cin many ways this is an impressive report \u2014 the Vatican\u2019s first forthright account of its own cover-up of a sexual predator.\u201d She says it is \u201clong, detailed, and it names enablers,\u201d and adds that Bishop Accountability hopes it is the first step toward \u201cgenuine transparency.\u201d Barrett Doyle also says the McCarrick report has deficiencies, including its treatment of Pope Francis\u2019 role. \u201cIts greatest failure is that it lets Pope Francis off the hook: nobody gave him the files, he knew only that there had been rumors, etc.,\u201d she says. \u201cDidn\u2019t the Pope wonder if those rumors had substance? Anyone with an internet connection could have discovered they did. Francis\u2019 lack of curiosity was at best negligent, at worst corrupt.\u201d Barrett Doyle also notes the report doesn\u2019t account for McCarrick\u2019s handling of abusive priests in the dioceses he ran. ___NoonAn advocate in Argentina for survivors of clerical sex abuse says ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick caused tremendous hurt and laments that church officials knew but did not act. Julieta A\u00f1azco is the co-founder and former head of the Argentine Network of Survivors of Ecclestiastical Abuse and currently a member of Churches Without Abuses. She tells The Associated Press that \u201cthe damage and the pain that McCarrick cannot be calculated\u201d and that \u201ceveryone knew,\u201d including Saint John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, powerful cardinals and top Vatican officials. A\u00f1azco says \u201cany official could have put a stop to it, but they did not.\u201d A\u00f1azco praises the release of the Vatican\u2019s report on its investigation of the case, however, saying it is \u201cat least a step toward transparency.\u201d She calls on Francis to publish findings on a school for the hearing-impaired in Mendoza province where dozens of students denounced abuse by clerics and lay workers. Two priests were convicted in the case last year and sentenced to more than 40 years in prison. ___11:30 a.m.The bishop of the New Jersey diocese of Metuchen, which was headed by Theodore McCarrick when it was established in 1981, says he is \u201cdisgusted and appalled\u201d by the sex abuse scandal involving the ex-cardinal.Bishop James Checchio says that \u201cwhile I am grateful to Pope Francis for ordering this study to arrive at the \u2018truth\u2019 of what happened, like everyone else, I am disgusted and appalled by what has taken place.\u201dHe adds that the Vatican\u2019s report on its McCarrick investigation \u201cwill, undoubtedly, cause sadness, anxiety, frustration, anger, disgust and pain.\u201dChecchio says that since implementing new abuse prevention policies in 2002, the diocese \u201chas not received a single credible complaint of abuse involving a minor in any of our schools or parishes by diocesan clergy.\u201dHe laments that the diocese\u2019s founding will \u201calways be associated with the history of Theodore McCarrick and the culture of abuse, silence and shame that was allowed to perpetuate in the dark corners of our past,\u201d but says there is \u201ca new opportunity to lead lives of increased holiness.\u201dCardinal Timothy Dolan of New York is crediting the abuse survivors who approached the archdiocese with their allegations against McCarrick.Dolan says they \u201chelped bring this matter to light, proving that anyone who has abused a minor, even a cardinal, will be punished.\u201dHe says that when the first allegation was reported, church officials asked the Vatican for permission to arrange for an outside investigation and to have the issue judged by a lay review board, and Pope Francis responded by saying the case should be handled \u201cas you would for any priest accused of abuse.\u201dDolan praises Francis for trusting the processes followed by the archdiocese and others in the country, saying it \u201cwas very affirming, and will lead, I hope, to others having the confidence to come forward, knowing that their allegations will be handled seriously, sensitively, and appropriately.\u201d ___10:45 a.m.The archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, says the Vatican\u2019s investigation of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick \u201crepresents a significant and powerful step forward in advancing accountability and transparency regarding sexual abuse.\u201dTobin says \u201cfailures by some leaders in the Catholic Church have wounded many,\u201d but \u201cthe Church has made progress in responding to clergy abuse by implementing and updating policies and programs to safeguard the faithful, especially the most vulnerable among us.\u201dCardinal-designate Wilton Gregory, archbishop of Washington D.C., says his \u201cheart hurts for all who will be shocked, saddened, scandalized and angered by the revelations\u201d in the report.Gregory says the disclosure is necessary if there is to be \u201ctrue redemptive healing.\u201d\u201cThis is an important, difficult and necessary document,\u201d Gregory says, \u201cand it demands prayerful, thorough and thoughtful reflection.\u201d And Los Angeles Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Gomez, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, says the McCarrick scandal is \u201canother tragic chapter in the Church\u2019s long struggle to confront the crimes of sexual abuse by clergy.\u201d He expresses his \u201cprofound sorrow and deepest apologies\u201d to the ex-cardinal\u2019s victims, their families and all survivors of clerical sex abuse.\u201cThis report underscores the need for us to repent and grow in our commitment to serve the people of God,\u201d Gomez says. ___A lawyer whose firm is handling five cases naming Theodore McCarrick as a perpetrator of sex abuse says the Vatican\u2019s report on its investigation into the former cardinal \u201chas the potential to be an historic first step toward top-down transparency within the Catholic Church.\u201d Attorney Jeff Anderson says the report is \u201cunprecedented\u201d in that, for the first time, \u201cthe Vatican has engaged a third-party, non-clergy lawyer to conduct the investigation, collect the evidence, connect the dots, and expose not only a perpetrator, but a system that put children in peril for decades.\u201dAnderson says Pope Francis\u2019 actions going forward \u201cwill determine if he will lead a Church thoroughly committed to the healing and justice it espouses by walking the hard road of accountability, or one willing to expose only its most notorious offender to keep our eyes off those hiding in the shadows.\u201d___SNAP, a network representing survivors of clergy sex-abuse, is welcoming the Vatican\u2019s report on its investigation of former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick but says many more steps need to be taken to prevent abuse. The group calls for the removal of \u201cany prelate who was aware of McCarrick\u2019s crimes and did nothing,\u201d as well as \u201ca pope who is willing to talk earnestly and often about what actions he is taking to combat clergy abuse worldwide.\u201dSNAP says the abuse crisis is an ongoing one, and transparency and accountability are still lacking.It calls the report \u201cone step in the right direction\u201d but says the Vatican must ensure that past mistakes will not be repeated. \u201cAwareness is good,\u201d it says. \u201cBut awareness is meaningless without concrete action.\u201d "}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/Bethlehem-Christmas-Eve-Coronavirus-c7131351577b5d9c67e61a7611bc9b42", "headline": "Coronavirus dampens Christmas joy in Bethlehem and elsewhere ...", "date": "2020-12-25T02:45:43Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) \u2014 Bethlehem on Thursday ushered in Christmas Eve with a stream of joyous marching bands and the triumphant arrival of the top Catholic clergyman in the Holy Land, but few people were there to greet them as the coronavirus pandemic and a strict lockdown dampened celebrations in the traditional birthplace of Jesus.Similar subdued scenes were repeated across the world as the festive family gatherings and packed prayers that typically mark the holiday were scaled back or canceled altogether. In Australia, worshippers had to book tickets online to attend socially distanced church services. The Philippines prohibited mass gatherings and barred extended families from holding traditional Christmas Eve dinners. Traditional door-to-door children\u2019s carols were canceled in Greece.ADVERTISEMENTOn Christmas Eve in Italy, church bells rang earlier than usual. The Italian government\u2019s 10 p.m. curfew prompted pastors to move up services, with \u201cMidnight\u201d Mass starting Thursday evening in some churches as early as a couple hours after dark. Pope Francis, who has said people \u201cmust obey\u201d civil authorities\u2019 measures to fight the spread of COVID-19, fell in line. This year, the Christmas vigil Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica was moved up from 9:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Normally, seats at the vigil Mass are quickly snapped up, by Romans and by tourists, but the pandemic has reduced tourists in Italy to a trickle. In keeping with social distancing measures, barely 200 faithful \u2014 instead of several thousand \u2014 spaced out in the basilica\u2019s pews and wearing masks, attended Francis\u2019 celebration of the Mass. A row of fiery red poinsettia plants warmly contrasted with the sumptuous cold marble of the basilica. Francis in his homily offered reflections on Christmas\u2019 significance. \u201cWe often hear it said that the greatest joy in life is the birth of a child. It is something extraordinary and it changes everything,\u201d he said. A child \u201cmakes us feel loved but can also teach us how to love.\u201d \u201cGod was born a child in order to encourage us to care for others,\u201d said Francis, who has made attention to the poor and unjustly treated a key theme of his papacy.Celebrations elsewhere in Europe were canceled or greatly scaled back as virus infections surge across the continent and a new variant that may be more contagious has been detected. In Athens, Christmas Eve was eerily silent. In normal times, voices of children singing carols while tinkling metal triangles can be heard all day. The decades-old custom, in which children go house to house and receive small gifts, was banned this year. Groups of children managed to honor the tradition by singing to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis by video link \u2014including students from a school for children with hearing difficulty who performed in sign language.Throughout the pandemic, one of the hardest-hit churches in New York City has been Saint Peter\u2019s Lutheran Church in Manhattan. Church leaders say more than 60 members of the congregation \u2014 which numbered about 800 before the pandemic \u2014 have died of COVID-19, almost all of them part of the community of some 400 who attended services in Spanish.Despite their own heartbreaks, congregation members \u2014 many of them immigrants \u2014 donated coats, scarves and other winter clothes for more than 100 migrant minors at a detention center in Manhattan.While many other New York City churches have resumed in-person services, Saint Peter\u2019s continues to offer its Masses only online. The schedule for Christmas Eve and Christmas day included Masses in English and Spanish, and a bilingual jazz vespers service.In Bethlehem, officials tried to make the most out of a bad situation.\u201cChristmas is a holiday that renews hope in the souls,\u201d said Mayor Anton Salman. \u201cDespite all the obstacles and challenges due to corona and due to the lack of tourism, the city of Bethlehem is still looking forward to the future with optimism.\u201dADVERTISEMENTRaw, rainy weather added to the gloomy atmosphere, as several dozen people gathered in the central Manger Square to greet Latin Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa. Youth marching bands playing Christmas carols on bagpipes, accompanied by pounding drummers, led a joyous procession ahead of the patriarch\u2019s arrival early in the afternoon.\u201cDespite the restrictions and limitations we want to celebrate as much as possible, with family, community and joy,\u201d said Pizzaballa, who was to lead a small Midnight Mass gathering later in the evening. \u201cWe want to offer hope.\u201dThousands of foreign pilgrims usually flock to Bethlehem for the celebrations. But the closure of Israel\u2019s international airport to foreign tourists, along with Palestinian restrictions banning intercity travel in the areas they administer in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, kept visitors away.The restrictions limited attendance to residents and a small entourage of religious officials. Evening celebrations, when pilgrims normally congregate around the Christmas tree, were canceled, and Midnight Mass was limited to clergy. The coronavirus has dealt a heavy blow to Bethlehem\u2019s tourism sector, the lifeblood of the local economy. Restaurants, hotels and gift shops have been shuttered. In previous years, many Venezuelans have gone back home for the holidays to visit their relatives. But Colombia\u2019s government has shut down border crossings with Venezuela in a bid to slow down COVID-19 infections. Those who try to return home for the holidays must pay smugglers to get them back into Colombia. Yakelin Tamaure, a nurse who left Venezuela two years ago to escape her nation\u2019s economic crisis, said that this year there will be no gifts, or new clothes for her two children, aged 10 and 15. She lives in a small house in Bogota, far from the city center but can barely cover rent. Tamaure said she hasn\u2019t been able to find work as a nurse because she still doesn\u2019t have a residence permit. Her parents are still in Venezuela. \u201cMy mother broke her foot and can\u2019t walk properly so I\u2019m worried about her\u201d said Tamaure. \u201cI try to send her money, but its not the same as being there.\u201d Rio de Janeiro\u2019s iconic beaches remained open, but a City Hall decree aimed at limiting gatherings prevented drivers from parking along the shore. Rain also kept beachgoers at home.Thomas Azevedo and his 9-year-old son braved the bad weather to set up a small stand, selling beer and caipirinhas made from fresh fruit. By early afternoon, he hadn\u2019t sold a thing.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the rain; in previous years it was full of tourists at Christmas. This year there\u2019s no one,\u201d said Azevedo, 28.Australians had until recently been looking forward to a relatively COVID-19-free Christmas after travel restrictions across state borders relaxed in recent weeks in the absence of any evidence of community transmission. But after new cases were detected over the past week, states again closed their borders.South Koreans woke up Christmas morning to learn that their coronavirus crisis has taken another turn for the worse as officials shut down ski resorts and national parks, restricted hotel occupancy and set fines for restaurants accepting large groups to arrest a viral surge that has spiked occupancy and deaths.\u201cThe last week of the year that begins with Christmas is normally a time where people gather and share their affection with one another, but it\u2019s hard to see that this year in any parts of the world,\u201d Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun, the government\u2019s No. 2 behind President Moon Jae-in, said during a virus meeting.Song Ju-hyeon, a resident in Paju, near Seoul, who is expecting a child in February, said home is the only place she feels safe as the virus continues to slam the capital area.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like Christmas anyway, there\u2019s no carols being played on the streets,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much transmission going on, and you just can\u2019t tell who\u2019s carrying the virus or not as it also spreads without symptoms. Christmas doesn\u2019t mean much anyway when it\u2019s this scary to go out.\u201dWhile many places around the globe were keeping or increasing restrictions for Christmas, Lebanon was an exception. With its economy in tatters and parts of its capital destroyed by a massive Aug. 4 port explosion, Lebanon has lifted most virus measures ahead of the holidays, hoping to encourage spending. Tens of thousands of Lebanese expatriates have arrived home for the holidays, leading to fears of an inevitable surge in cases during the festive season.Lebanon has the largest percentage of Christians in the Middle East \u2014 about a third of its 5 million people \u2014 and traditionally celebrates Christmas with much fanfare. \u201cPeople around us were tired, depressed and depleted, so we said let\u2019s just plant a drop of joy and love,\u201d said Sevine Ariss, one of the organizers of a Christmas fair along the seaside road where the explosion caused the most damage. ___Federman reported from Jerusalem.

Detectives are struggling to connect with victims through thick masks, and investigators accustomed to wearing plainclothes are digging out their dusty uniforms for patrol duty as the coronavirus pandemic rages.Police departments nationwide are grappling with changes the virus has wrought on their investigations, even as law enforcement agencies report major decreases in crime due to stay-at-home orders. Authorities say enough wrongdoing abounds to keep police busy, and detective work must still be in-person and hands-on, despite COVID-19. Evidence has to be collected, statements must be taken in person and death notifications need to be made face-to-face.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cYou put on gloves and you put on masks and you\u2019ve still got to go out there and do it,\u201d said Los Angeles Police Capt. Jonathan Tippet, head of the elite Robbery-Homicide Division.Police around the country have to put some investigations on hold as they detail detectives to help out with social distance patrols, or cover for their colleagues out sick with COVID-19. It\u2019s worrisome to former New York Police Department Sgt. Joe Giacalone, who is concerned about criminals across the country who will go undetected in the meantime.\u201cThat becomes a bigger problem down the road,\u201d Giacalone, a former cold case detective now a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \u201cInvestigators prevent further victimization by getting these guys off the streets.\u201dDespite fewer detectives in bureaus, police are finding workarounds and high-profile cases are still getting the necessary attention. The Los Angeles district attorney filed an additional sexual assault charge against disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein in April, and investigators in New York continue to delve into an unsolved Long Island serial killer case after they revealed new evidence earlier this year. In some cases, like cyber or financial crime, interviews can be transitioned to the phone to preserve social distancing. But others, such as sexual abuse, in-person interviews are a necessity.For traumatized children who need to be comforted, Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s detectives give \u201cair hugs\u201d and teach the kids phrases like \u201cI love you\u201d in sign language to overcome the impersonal nature of masks and social distancing. \u201cThey\u2019ll do anything they can to make these kids and these victims feel safe,\u201d said Carlos Marquez, a detective division commander in the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. ADVERTISEMENTDetectives elsewhere have been forced to investigate crimes that are outside their normal specialties. In the hardest-hit part of New Jersey, investigators in the Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office have been moved out of their individual squads \u2014 such as narcotics or sex crimes \u2014 into \u201cone big detective bureau.\u201dThat bureau is now made up of three mixed 35-person platoons, which work from home part of the time. The goal is to avoid an entire specialty squad contracting \u2014 or spreading \u2014 the virus and leaving the office without an important skill set.\u201cWe can\u2019t have the homicide squad coming in and out of the building left and right, infecting people,\u201d Chief of Detectives Robert Anzilotti said. The Bergen detectives are trying to limit extra work that would require bringing more people into headquarters. If a crime is caught on video, there\u2019s less of a need to have a specialist analyze the perpetrator\u2019s cellphone in a digital forensic lab as an additional step, Anzilotti said. \u201cWe\u2019re being more than thorough enough to make sure we sustain a conviction,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the phone needs to get dumped, it\u2019s getting dumped.\u201dThe coronavirus may also be indirectly responsible  for more overdose deaths, investigators say. One of the main supply chains for the chemicals to make methamphetamine and fentanyl is in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the global outbreak. As a result, police in Suffolk County, New York, believe suppliers are cutting narcotics with agents like fentanyl to make their inventory last longer, according to Gerard Gigante, chief of detectives for the Suffolk County police. The county\u2019s nonfatal suspected opioid overdoses spiked 69% between March 15 and April 12, as compared to the same time last year.In Arkansas, which does not have a stay-at-home order, Cleburne County Sheriff Chris Brown said his deputies are not responding to lower-level crimes such as theft and property damage. Instead, they\u2019re doing interviews over the phone and asking the victims to document the incident. \u201cEmail me the pictures and we\u2019ll take a report for you,\u201d he\u2019s instructed his deputies to tell residents.His office is still executing a couple of search warrants a week and conducting raids on suspected drug dealers\u2019 homes \u2014 the county\u2019s drug of choice is methamphetamine \u2014 but deputies are working with Cleburne health officials to make sure a target\u2019s house has not been exposed to the virus.\u201cIf the drug dealers haven\u2019t slowed down,\u201d he said, \u201cwe feel like we can\u2019t let them run rampant.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/bahrain-formula-one-lewis-hamilton-0ca12b09889d30266c40f53b926f93c7", "headline": "Hamilton praised for urging F1 to help improve human rights | AP ...", "date": "2020-11-27T19:26:08Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "1 of 6Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton of Britain participates in a media conference prior to the Bahrain Formula One Grand Prix at the International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain, Thursday, Nov. 26, 2020.

The Bahrain Formula One Grand Prix will take place on Sunday. (Mario Renzi, Pool via AP)Lewis Hamilton has been praised by a human rights group for urging Formula One to help improve people\u2019s rights in places where they go racing.The seven-time world champion received personally addressed letters from three alleged torture victims in Bahrain, and Hamilton\u2019s reaction was welcomed by Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, the director of the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy.\u201cIt is very encouraging to hear Lewis taking human rights so seriously and recognising the need for Formula 1 to do more as a sport to push for change,\u201d Alwadaei told The Associated Press by email. \u201cI\u2019m glad that he has received our letters and look forward to providing his response to the torture survivors who have bravely risked reprisals by reaching out to him. Hundreds of Bahrainis remain imprisoned for voicing criticism of the government.\u201dHamilton received the letters at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Thursday, along with an NGO letter sent to F1 chairman Chase Carey listing alleged abuses in the Persian Gulf island since 2011.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThe human rights issue in so many of the places we go to is a massive problem,\u201d Hamilton said, pledging to read the the letters in detail. \u201cI do think as a sport we need to do more ... not just saying that we\u2019re going to do something (but) that we actually see some action taken.\u201dA total of 16 rights groups co-signed the letter to Carey, urging F1 to leverage compensation for victims and ensure people can protest races being held in Bahrain without reprisals.\u201cI still didn\u2019t receive a response from F1,\u201d Alwadaei told The AP late Friday.Bahrain is accused of exploiting F1 to \u201csportswash\u201d its human rights abuses. Another letter sent to Carey, co-signed by 30 British cross-party parliamentarians, asked F1 to implement its human rights policy at the Bahrain GP amid concerns about rights violations linked to the race.Bahrain\u2019s National Communication Centre responded on Friday to an email request from The AP to explain the government\u2019s position on accusations of torture.\u201cThe government of Bahrain takes the protection of its citizens\u2019 human rights and freedom of expression extremely seriously, and this is explicitly protected by Bahrain\u2019s constitution,\u201d the centre said. \u201cThe Kingdom has a zero-tolerance policy towards mistreatment of any kind. The government has put in place a range of internationally-recognised safeguards to ensure human rights abuses do not occur.\u201dThe three survivors\u2019 letters, initially reported by The Guardian newspaper and obtained by The AP, contain harrowing descriptions of extreme beatings, torture and sexual abuse.ADVERTISEMENTThe first was from Ali AlHajee, held for seven years in Jau Prison for organizing pro-democracy protests. His cell is 11 kilometers (seven miles) from the F1 track in Sakhir.\u201cWhen I was taken into custody, security officers brutally tortured me, seeking confessions to crimes I did not commit. I was beaten so badly that I required two surgeries to repair the damage to my nose and was left partially deaf,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Bahraini government goes to extreme lengths to keep patrons of the Grand Prix insulated from the realities of their repressive regime. They want the world to see the Bahrain of fast cars and expensive parties.\u2019\u201dThe second letter came from mother-of-four Najah Yusuf.After writing a Facebook post demanding justice for those imprisoned for protesting the race, she was sentenced to three years in jail. She described to Hamilton her treatment by officers from Bahrain\u2019s National Security Agency.\u201cThey beat me and tore my hijab off and tried to strangle me with it. When I still refused to comply, one officer sexually assaulted me. My dignity was destroyed and I considered suicide. Only the thought of my children stopped me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy son Kameel is now just 17 years old, but he is facing 21 years in prison. Since January, the government has piled over 20 trumped-up cases against him.\u201dYusuf asked if Hamilton would consider meeting her and other activists.\u201cHear our stories for yourself,\u201d she suggested. \u201cTogether, perhaps we can encourage positive change in Bahrain.\u201dThe third letter was written by Mohammed Ramadhan, a former member of Bahrain\u2019s security forces now on death row.\u201cWhen the regime discovered that I had supported Bahrain\u2019s pro-democracy uprising, it took revenge against me and framed me in a murder case ...

She was always absolutely sure of what they wanted to read \u2014 and, perhaps more important, what they didn\u2019t want to read \u2014 and yet she managed to surprise them with every book.\u201dADVERTISEMENTWidowed in her late 30s with five children, she became a perennial bestseller over the second half of her life, writing or co-writing \u201cA Stranger Is Watching,\u201d \u201cDaddy\u2019s Little Girl\u201d and more than 50 other favorites. Sales topped 100 million copies and honors came from all over, including a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters from France or a Grand Master statuette back home from the Mystery Writers of America. Many of her books, like \u201cA Stranger is Watching\u201d and \u201cLucky Day,\u201d were adapted for movies and television. She also collaborated on several novels with her daughter, Carol Higgins Clark.Mary Higgins Clark specialized in women triumphing over danger, such as the besieged young prosecutor in \u201cJust Take My Heart\u201d or the mother of two and art gallery worker whose second husband is a madman in \u201cA Cry in the Night.\u201d Clark\u2019s goal as an author was simple, if rarely easy: Keep the readers reading.\u201cYou want to turn the page,\u201d she told The Associated Press in 2013. \u201cThere are wonderful sagas you can thoroughly enjoy a section and put it down. But if you\u2019re reading my book, I want you stuck with reading the next paragraph. The greatest compliment I can receive is, \u2018I read your darned book \u2018til 4 in the morning, and now I\u2019m tired.\u2019 I say, \u2018Then you get your money\u2019s worth.\u2019\u201dHer own life taught her lessons of resilience \u2014 strengthened by her Catholic faith \u2014 that she shared with her fictional heroines. She was born Mary Higgins in 1927 in New York City, the second of three children. She would later take the last name Clark after marriage. Her father ran a popular pub that did well enough for the family to afford a maid and for her mother to prepare meals for strangers in need. But business slowed during the Great Depression, and her father, forced to work ever longer hours as he laid off employees, died in his sleep in 1939. One of her brothers died of meningitis a few years later. Surviving family members took on odd jobs and had to rent out rooms in the house.Clark had always loved to write. At age 6, she completed her first poem, which her mother proudly requested she recite in front of the family. A story she wrote in grade school impressed her teacher enough that Clark read it to the rest of the class. By high school, she was trying to sell stories to True Confessions magazine.After working as a hotel switchboard operator \u2014 Tennessee Williams was among the guests she eavesdropped on \u2014 and a flight attendant for Pan American, she married Capital Airways regional manager Warren Clark in 1949. Throughout the 1950s and into the \u201960s, she raised their children, studied writing at New York University and began getting stories published. Some stories drew upon her experiences at Pan American. Another story, which appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, \u201cBeauty Contest at Buckingham Palace,\u201d imagined a pageant featuring Queen Elizabeth II, Jackie Kennedy and Princess Grace of Monaco. But by the mid-60s, the magazine market for fiction was rapidly shrinking and her husband\u2019s health was failing; Warren Clark died of a heart attack in 1964.Clark quickly found work as a script writer for \u201cPortrait of a President,\u201d a radio series on American presidents. Her research inspired her first book, a historical novel about George and Martha Washington. She was so determined that she began getting up at 5 a.m., working until nearly 7 a.m. before feeding her children and leaving for work.\u201cAspire to the Heavens\u201d was published in 1969. It was \u201ca triumph,\u201d she recalled in her memoir \u201cKitchen Privileges,\u201d but also a folly. The book\u2019s publisher was sold near the release date and it received little attention. She regretted the title and learned that some stores placed the book in religious sections. Her compensation was $1,500, minus commission. Decades later, the novel would be reissued, far more successfully, as \u201cMount Vernon: A Love Story.\u201dFor her next book, she wanted to make some money. Following a guideline she would often suggest to other writers, she looked at her bookshelves, which featured novels by Agatha Christie, Rex Stout and other mystery writers, and decided she should write the kind of book she liked to read. A recent tabloid trial about a young woman accused of murdering her children gave her an idea.\u201cIt seemed inconceivable to most of us that any woman could do that to her children,\u201d Mary Clark wrote in her memoir. \u201cAnd then I thought: Suppose an innocent young mother is convicted of the deliberate murder of her two children; suppose she gets out of prison on a technicality; and then suppose seven years to the day, on her 32nd birthday, the children of her second marriage disappear.\u201dIn September 1974, she sent her agent a manuscript for \u201cDie a Little Death,\u201d acquired months later by Simon & Schuster for $3,000. Renamed \u201cWhere are the Children?\u201d and released in 1975, it became her first bestseller and began her long, but not entirely surprising, run of success. She would allege that a psychic had told her she would become rich and famous.Clark, who wrote well into her 90s, more than compensated for her early struggles. She acquired several homes and for a time owned part of the New Jersey Nets. She was among a circle of authors, including Lee Child and Nelson DeMille, who regularly met for dinner in Manhattan. She also had friends in Washington and was a White House guest during the presidential administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Barbara Bush became a close friend. Married since 1996 to former Merrill Lynch Futures CEO John J. Conheeney, Clark remembered well the day she said goodbye to hard times. It was in April 1977, and her agent had told her that Simon & Schuster was offering $500,000 for the hardcover to her third novel, \u201cA Stranger is Watching,\u201d and that the publisher Dell was paying $1 million for the paperback. She had been running her own script production company during the day and studying for a philosophy degree at Fordham University at night, returning home to New Jersey in an old car with more than 100,000 miles on it.\u201cAs I drove onto the Henry Hudson Parkway, the tailpipe and muffler came loose and began dragging on the ground. For the next 21 miles, I kur-plunked, kur-plunked, all the way home,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cPeople in other cars kept honking and beeping, obviously sure that I was either too stupid or too deaf to hear the racket.\u201cThe next day I bought a Cadillac!\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/business-product-safety-us-consumer-product-safety-commission-f21fb7a829b0928061b8521ac9499dc2", "headline": "CPSC Urges Consumers to Remove Latches/Locks on Cavalier ...", "date": "2020-05-28T01:01:17Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1973 and charged with protecting the American public from unreasonable risks of serious injury or death from more than 15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction.

The psalm \u2014 often chanted or sung \u2014 was signed as well.And when the priest addressed the worshippers, he signed: \u201cThe Lord be with you.\u201d A flurry of hands signed back: \u201cAnd with your spirit.\u201d For many, vocalized hymns, homilies, and prayers make up much of the experience of a typical religious service. Yet worshipping silently \u2014 in ASL \u2014 is standard fare at Gallaudet, the world\u2019s premier college for the deaf and hard of hearing. And religious students say the language shift is but a small window into the subtle ways their communities intertwine deaf culture with the divine to produce uncommon expressions of faith and activism.Christina DiSalvo, a hearing Catholic who serves as a lay chaplain to Gallaudet\u2019s Catholic community and often works as an interpreter during services, explained that her team uses a lectionary that adapts phrases such as \u201chear the gospel\u201d to be signed \u201cpay attention,\u201d or \u201chear our prayer\u201d to \u201caccept our prayer.\u201dRelated coverageFast start to jury selection in Arbery death federal trialSupreme Court sides with GOP in Alabama election map caseBlack lawmakers blast plans for monument to Justice ThomasRemoved slavery backer Calhoun's statue still without a homeADVERTISEMENTOther changes would be striking to anyone used to a Mass where the hearing are in the majority. DiSalvo said that unlike services at hearing parishes, where the priest may remain up front during scripture readings, the priest at Gallaudet sits down with the community to avoid being a visual distraction.\u201cHaving information is the most important thing,\u201d said DiSalvo, who works for the Archdiocese of Washington\u2019s Department of Special Needs Ministries. \u201cIf the pastor is up at the front, they can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on.\u201dEqual access to information is not just a practical matter; it\u2019s also a fundamental value in deaf culture. For faith groups at Gallaudet, it doublesas a religious principle.---This content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.-\u2014\u201cThat comes from oppression,\u201d DiSalvo said. She offered an example: \u201cIf something goes on in church, (a deaf person) asks, \u2018Oh, what did they say? What are we praying for?\u2019 Then someone responds, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll tell you later. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\u201dLack of information in worship was a childhood struggle for Abdulrahman Alshehri, a student who belongs to Gallaudet\u2019s sizable Muslim population \u2014 around 20 of whom, like Alshehri, hail from Saudi Arabia. Until he came to the U.S., he didn\u2019t realize how much he had been missing at Friday prayer services.\u201cI came to America, and there was this person who said, \u2018Do you understand anything about what they\u2019re saying (during worship)?\u2019 And I answered honestly that I didn\u2019t,\u201d Alshehri said through an interpreter.ADVERTISEMENTBack home in Saudi Arabia, Alshehri now attends services where a live video feed shows an interpreter signing the imam\u2019s words in Arabic Sign Language. But at Gallaudet, the ritual Islamic daily prayers often make an interpreter unnecessary: He simply mouths the words silently to himself. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to hear what\u2019s said,\u201d he explained, adding that he long ago memorized sections of Friday prayer services as well. \u201cI know that passage of the prayers by heart.\u201dWhen asked how communicating in ASL alters his experience with scripture, Gideon Firl instructed an interpreter who had been vocalizing Firl\u2019s signs to stop. Then Firl, a Christian who is deaf, began to sign theatrically, adding dramatic flourishes and gestures to his words.His exact phrasing was unclear to those unschooled in ASL, but his meaning was easy to parse: In the midst of darkness, a tiny ball of light burned; then a figure emerged to lead others away.\u201cJesus came to show us the way,\u201d Firl said, permitting the interpreter to speak again. He smiled as he appeared to paraphrase a quote from the Gospel of John: \u201c(He is) the light, and the light in our lives.\u201dHe added: \u201cI feel like sign language is in a way universal \u2014 there\u2019s something there that everyone can understand.\u201dReligion is closely tied to the history of Gallaudet, which Congress authorized to confer college degrees in 1864. One of the school\u2019s oldest and most prominent buildings is Chapel Hall, where students were once required to attend services. Among its celebrated graduates is Andrew Foster, the first African American to receive a bachelor\u2019s degree at the school, who worked as a missionary to establish schools for the deaf throughout Africa.\u201cGallaudet is, at its core, deaf \u2014 but (also) at its core are our beliefs and our faiths,\u201d Firl said.For the most part, Gallaudet students describe a campus religious life similar to that at virtually any small liberal arts college. Sunni and Shiite Muslims, who use a common prayer room that can accommodate an array of Islamic traditions, casually discuss their religious differences. Jews and Christians belong to various on- and off-campus organizations and support groups that host worship services and Bible studies.Students of all faiths report occasionally being asked about their beliefs by more secular peers, sometimes to dramatic effect: Firl recounted an incident where he fell asleep reading the Bible at a party, only to be awakened by astonished friends who joked with him about his reading material.As at other American campuses, religious students say they can sometimes feel isolated. But Abigael Mercurio, a Christian graduate student who is not deaf but signed throughout her interview with RNS, suggested that some deaf people\u2019s disaffection with organized religion is heightened by frustrating encounters with religious institutions.\u201cI\u2019ve heard people tell me stories where they have negative experiences working with the church, or they feel that they\u2019re deaf because God has punished them in some way, punished their family,\u201d said Mercurio, who grew up a nondenominational Christian.Alana Solomon, a graduate student who is hearing, pointed to parallels between deaf encounters with persecution and maltreatment and those experienced by Jews such as herself.\u201cI would say here at Gallaudet (oppression) is a much more common discussion \u2014 in a positive way,\u201d she said.For many at Gallaudet, faith activism is inseparable from the experience of being deaf or hard of hearing. Because Gallaudet receives funding from Congress, student diplomas carry the signature of the president of the United States. But following Donald Trump\u2019s election, some students have begun requesting to have the commander in chief\u2019s autograph removed from their graduation certificate \u2014 including Solomon, who said her desire to expunge the president\u2019s name was partially inspired by her Jewish faith.Conversations about injustice are a constant at Gallaudet, which boasts a history of activism, much of it rooted in forging solidarity across difference.When Professor Kirk VanGilder\u2019s class on interfaith work coordinated with the campus Hillel, a Jewish organization, to hold a candlelight vigil in October 2018 after the massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the gathering seamlessly incorporated commemorations for two African Americans shot at a Kroger in Kentucky and discussion of an anti-transgender incident that occurred on campus.\u201cWe had a vigil that was mostly framed around the Tree of Life event, but also brought in intersections of other kinds of discrimination and marginalization happening on campus,\u201d VanGilder, an ordained Methodist minister, said through an interpreter. \u201cWe had a number of people seated from different faiths in the audience.\u201cMaybe I\u2019m here for you more because we\u2019re both deaf, and that becomes a bridge for developing religious solidarity,\u201d VanGilder said.Students in VanGilder\u2019s current class added that Gallaudet\u2019s religious diversity lends itself to interfaith dialogue. Anne, the granddaughter of a Baptist minister, said her exposure to other faiths had altered her understanding of faith itself.\u201cGallaudet in general has changed my perspective,\u201d she said through an interpreter. \u201cMy freshman year my roommate was Muslim, and this was the first Muslim friend I ever had. I learned so much from that person.\u201dThe school is known for exerting broad influence on deaf communities in the U.S. and abroad, and its alumni can crop up in prominent faith spaces: Firl is slated to star in a film produced by Deaf Missions, an Iowa-based Christian group that claims \u201conly 2%\u201d of deaf people \u201chave been introduced to Jesus.\u201dFirl, who attends a Church of the Brethren congregation in Frederick, Maryland, portrays the titular Christ in a pilot version of the film that focuses on the biblical story of a woman who committed adultery. With enough funding, they are hoping to expand production to chronicle Jesus\u2019 entire life.\u201cThe Bible is wonderful, but (some) people don\u2019t have language to read it, so we focus on presenting it in ASL,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m a little biased, but I think the Bible is best told in sign language.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/78809db3b9ac4eb4a7e89f6a4078fdcc", "headline": "Activist sues over Legislature's lack of assistance for deaf | AP News", "date": "2019-06-10T17:14:03Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "TOPEKA, Kan.

Their alleged abusers go on trial starting Monday in a case that Pope Francis, an Argentine, has not commented on publicly despite its closeness to his papacy.ADVERTISEMENTThe complaints at the institute came to light at the end of 2016 and created a scandal that deepened when it emerged that one of the accused, the Rev. Nicola Corradi, had been reported for similar allegations at the Antonio Pr\u00f3volo institute in Verona, Italy, and that the pope had been notified that Corradi was running a similar center in Argentina.\u201cThose of us from the Pr\u00f3volo in Mendoza said: \u2018no more fear. We have the power,\u2019\u201d Villalonga told The Associated Press with the help of an interpreter, explaining how others decided to come forward after an initial \u201cbrave\u201d person did so.The AP doesn\u2019t name alleged sexual assault victims unless they make their identities public, which Villalonga did in an interview in the headquarters of the human rights group Xumek, which is the plaintiff in the trial.Alejandro Gull\u00e9, chief prosecutor in Mendoza, called the trial \u201cunprecedented, one of the most important in this province, one whose importance will transcend this country.\u201dOn trial for aggravated sexual abuse of minors, sexual touching and corrupting minors will be: Corradi, an Italian who is 83 and under house arrest; the Rev. Horacio Corbacho, a 59-year-old priest; and Armando G\u00f3mez, 63. The latter two are Argentines and in prison in Mendoza. Corbacho has pleaded not guilty and the other two defendants have not entered pleas.They are charged with 28 alleged crimes against 10 deaf minors and face prison sentences of up to 20 years. It is the first in a series of trials in which other former members of the now-closed school will be judged. Others implicated include two nuns who allegedly participated or knew about the abuses, as well as former directors and employees who are accused of knowing about the abuse but taking no action.Prosecutors say that not only were children sexually touched and abused, but were sometimes forced to watch pornography or perform sex acts among themselves.ADVERTISEMENTJorge Bord\u00f3n, an institute employee, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018 in the case for rape, sexual touching and corrupting minors by forcing children to perform sex acts on each other. But the former students at the Mendoza school believe they can achieve the first prison sentences for priests and clergy at the Roman Catholic institute, which has other branches. They are also demanding Francis strip the alleged abusers of their status as priests in the canonical process.\u201cFrancis was very quiet about the abusive priests, but now the sentence is coming,\u201d said Villalonga. \u201cI know that the pope is afraid because the deaf have been brave.\u201dThe Vatican has not commented publicly on the trial. The Holy See would be loath to be seen as interfering in a criminal trial, and typically defers all comment, as well as the outcome of its own investigations, until after all investigations by civil law enforcement are completed.In 2017, it sent two Argentine priests to investigate what happened in Mendoza. Dante Simon, a judicial vicar, told the AP that the acts denounced are \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cmore than plausible.\u201d He said the pontiff expressed his sadness and told him that \u201che was very worried about this situation and it would be a labor.\u201dIn a report submitted to the Vatican in June of that year, Simon requested the application of the maximum penalty to Corradi and Corbacho, that they be made to \u201cresign directly by the Holy Father.\u201d The report must be reviewed by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.The case hits close to home for the Vatican, which is accused of having disregarded the warnings of the alleged Italian victims of Corradi, when just months earlier the pope had promulgated new rules to combat abuse in the church.Corradi was singled out for similar abuses committed since the 1950s at the Provolo institute in Verona, Italy. His name appeared in a letter addressed to the pope in 2014 in which the Italian accusers mentioned several allegedly abusive priests who continued to exercise the ministry and said that Corradi and three other priests were in Argentina.\u201cTwo and a half years have passed (since the Mendoza case was uncovered) and Francisco has not uttered a single word to the survivors of the Pr\u00f3volo in Mendoza,\u201d Paola Gonz\u00e1lez, whose 16-year-old daughter was an alleged victim at the institute.According to the investigation, the alleged abusers especially targeted children who spent the night in the institute\u2019s shelters, some of whom came from surrounding provinces.Prosecutor Gustavo Stroppiana said one victim claimed to have been \u201ctied with chains\u201d while abused.\u201cWe found prophylactics and birth control pills\u201d in raids carried on the Pr\u00f3volo institute in Mendoza, he said.The crimes allegedly took place in the dormitories of the two priests and of the children, in a loft and in a small chapel called the House of God where the children took first communion.The children, with limited financial resources, didn\u2019t dare report the abuse because they were threatened with expulsion or the imprisonment of their parents, prosecutors said. Their communication skills were limited because they were not taught sign language at the school.Authorities in Buenos Aires province recently ordered the arrest of Corradi for alleged abuses in the Pr\u00f3volo Institute in La Plata, a city about 45 miles (70 kilometers) from the capital, Buenos Aires. It is believed the Italian priest went to that center in the 1980s after he was transferred from Verona before heading to Mendoza in the 1990s.The accusers\u2019 relatives say the transfers of Corradi would follow the church practice at the time of moving accused priests around the world to different parishes and locations.Many Argentines are wondering why Francis did not remove Corradi from the Mendoza institute after being warned about the allegations against him in Verona.Corradi\u2019s name appeared publicly in 2009 when 67 deaf people said they had been abused in the Verona institute by 24 priests, lay workers and religious brothers. They said he had been moved to Argentina. The Italian priest\u2019s name appeared again in a letter addressed to the pope in 2014 that pointed out the potential danger he represented to minors.The Verona diocese sanctioned four of the 24 defendants, but not Corradi. There was no criminal case because of the elapsed time.Faced with criticism by the families of the Argentine victims, the Archbishopric of Mendoza said it didn\u2019t know the background of the Italian priest when he arrived in the province and that the priest didn\u2019t depend on the local church but on a religious congregation based in Italy. It expressed its \u201csolidarity and closeness\u201d with the accusers and considered that \u201cthe corresponding responsibilities and sanctions\u201d should be established.Anne Barret Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, told the AP that she does not expect a response from the Vatican and the pope.\u201cPope Francis will continue to pretend that he has no responsibility for the atrocities in Mendoza. If he does respond, it will be a pro forma statement about his commitment to ending child sex abuse in the Church.\u201dShe added that when the crimes at the Verona school made world headlines in 2009 and 2010, \u201cthe pope was president of the Argentine bishops\u2019 conference. He could have ordered an investigation of the Mendoza and La Plata schools then.\u201d\u201cAnd certainly, as pope, he could have acted years ago. He was notified by the Verona victims of Corradi\u2019s presence in Argentina.\u201dVillalonga said he hopes a conviction will restore his calm.\u201cThe pope has ignored us, taken us the deaf for fools,\u201d he said.", "date": "2019-08-04T16:54:42Z"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/08a851730f5543b3ace9f2aa0848d9bc", "headline": "Mother admits killing adopted son, burning down home | AP News", "date": "2019-04-02T23:11:23Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "NORWICH, N.Y.

(AP) \u2014 Shannon Coffee wanted to learn sign language in high school back home in Ohio, yet the timing never worked out and she focused first on getting through her Spanish studies as her mom suggested.Coffee found a class right away the moment she arrived at Stanford to play basketball four years ago.\u201cI was drawn to it,\u201d she said.On Monday night, the senior will sign the national anthem before her final home game at Maples Pavilion. Coffee approached coach Tara VanDerveer midseason inquiring whether she might sign The Star-Spangled Banner for games, and the Hall of Fame coach told her of course.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cIt was just kind of something that I\u2019ve been interested in. I\u2019m not really sure what kind of drew me to it, but then when I got here to Stanford I heard that it was an option to take and I was like, \u2018Oh, I have to do it,\u2019\u201d Coffee recalled. \u201cLuckily I got in my freshman year to the class and I really enjoyed it. It\u2019s just different than other languages. I feel it\u2019s more beneficial in the lives of some people.\u201dSecond-seeded Stanford (29-4) will host seventh-seeded BYU (26-6) for a trip to the Chicago Regional semifinals. School officials cleared the idea with the NCAA before formally giving Coffee the go to sign, which she couldn\u2019t do for the 79-54 first-round win against UC Davis on Saturday because Stanford\u2019s band didn\u2019t perform the anthem.\u201cShe\u2019s taken sign language at Stanford and she asked me if she could do that and I said, yes. At first I thought she wanted to sing it and I said no. But signing is OK,\u201d VanDerveer said. \u201cShannon has had a fabulous senior year and we\u2019re not in the position that we\u2019re in without her great contributions. ...Shannon brings a lot to our team, she\u2019s a captain, a leader, it\u2019s really exciting to see her have such a great senior year and have some special talent, too.\u201dCoffee\u2019s contributions to Stanford may go under the radar \u2014 she has two career starts, both last season, and averaged 1.5 points and 1.5 rebounds as a senior \u2014 compared to the stars who play far more minutes and pile up impressive statistics. Though at 6-foot-5 and wearing a black mask in games to protect her nose after injuring it during a December practice, you can\u2019t miss Coffee when VanDerveer calls on her for key minutes off the bench. Coffee also is one of those high-achieving Stanford students who makes your jaw drop: A human biology major, she spent last summer interning with the Stanford Center for Clinical Research. There, she worked on a concussion study with research and data collection, a project involving mouth guards developed by Stanford engineers.ADVERTISEMENTSigning is a side passion. Coffee doesn\u2019t have any deaf family members or friends, but hopes she can provide something beneficial for the hearing-impaired when they attend Stanford games. She has been working one-on-one with her professor to become more proficient.\u201cI\u2019ve been working with her and just kind of getting to know her and the deaf culture and it\u2019s really important,\u201d Coffee said. \u201cSign language is really important to them and any little signs that you can do go a long way with the deaf community and I think that there\u2019s a lot of accommodations at arenas and different things like that for different people. Having the signed anthem can really just make people feel welcome, deaf people feel welcome and just kind of create just a community with them involved as well.\u201dSometimes in practice, teammate Anna Wilson \u2014 in her first year of sign language \u2014 will sign to Coffee and they don\u2019t even have to speak.Coffee just completed her fifth quarter of sign language courses.\u201cShannon helps me all the time studying for exams and whenever I have questions. Sometimes we\u2019re in practice and sometimes I\u2019ll sign to her instead of talking to her, just to practice. But I\u2019m not sure if really anyone else notices that. What\u2019s amazing about what Shannon does is that there\u2019s this whole group of people who in most cases aren\u2019t being included in or can\u2019t participate in the anthem and what\u2019s really awesome about what she\u2019s doing is she\u2019s opening a door for other people to be able to participate in something that is a huge part of sports and it\u2019s the opening part, it\u2019s the intro. I think it\u2019s really, really important and I think it\u2019s amazing that you do that.\u201d___More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/WomensNCAATournament and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "date": "2019-03-24T21:00:40Z"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/ff292e070d1c427997250370849162cf", "headline": "Argentina sets trial for priests accused of deaf kids abuse | AP News", "date": "2019-06-13T20:53:06Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 A court in Argentina will begin a trial on Aug. 5 against two priests accused of sexually abusing children at a school for youths with hearing disabilities.The case involving vulnerable children at the school in Mendoza province has shocked many in Pope Francis\u2019s homeland.A lawyer for the victims said Thursday that Italian priest Nicola Corradi, priest Horacio Corbacho and a third man who worked at the Antonio Provolo institute will go on trial on accusations of abusing more than 20 children.

(AP) \u2014 Students were eager to show off the progress they had made on their Mother\u2019s Day cards.Each one was hand-fashioned from scratch in Beth Wiggs\u2019 art class.Wiggs is the new art teacher at the Eastern North Carolina School for the Deaf in Wilson.\u201cEach individual is different,\u201d said Wiggs, who began work Feb. 4 after working as Fike High School art teacher.\u201cUnfortunately, in public school, the classrooms are so large that a lot of time is spent on classroom management, behaviors, particularly staying off the phone, not playing video games on the Chromebooks, staying focused on the assignments,\u201d Wiggs said. \u201cI felt more like I was dealing with behaviors than I was actually teaching. Here, I get to teach and 90 percent of the time I am giving individual instruction. I absolutely love that.\u201dADVERTISEMENTWiggs has a associate degree in fine arts from Caldwell Community College and a bachelor\u2019s in art education from Lenoir-Rhyne University.\u201cIt is a work in progress for me because I have never taught students who had disabilities before, so I am having to adjust my assignments and my expectations and how to evaluate,\u201d Wiggs said.Wiggs is learning sign language. For the time being, she has an interpreter in the classroom to help her communicate.\u201cIt has been challenging, but I tend to do good when there is a challenge,\u201d Wiggs said. \u201cThe interpreter has been invaluable. I will say something and then look at her and how she signs, so I am trying to teach and learn at the same time.\u201d\u201cEvery student here is an individual student here with their own talents and abilities,\u201d Wiggs said. \u201cEach individual is different. In my life skills class, they have more limitations, learning disabilities and developmental disabilities. So what they may create may not look like anything in particular to you and me, but to them, that is something they created, and you can see that sense of accomplishment and challenge. Some of them are just so extremely talented, and others are limited in their abilities, so that\u2019s where the individual instruction comes in.\u201dWhen students may not be that able to learn regular academics, they can come to art class and explore, Wiggs said.\u201cThey can have new experiences with hands-on medium, 3D and 2D, and that\u2019s rewarding to a teacher to put something out there and do a simple demonstration and see what they do to it. They translate it in their own individual way,\u201d Wiggs said.ADVERTISEMENTWiggs said art is \u201ca scaffold for all of the core subjects.\u201dSome art assignments require students to measure and produce grid drawings.\u201cLearning how to center something requires measuring, which is a form of math,\u201d Wiggs said. \u201cI want to do a project where they draw with words.\u201dWiggs has found that academics in the deaf culture are different than in public school.\u201cIt is just a whole culture unto itself,\u201d Wiggs said. \u201cI had no idea that there were so many differences there, so tapping into their culture and making it art-relevant to them has been a challenge, but it has been a great challenge. It has been a very positive thing. I am excited about moving on next near. I will be better prepared and can keep going and learning myself how to communicate with and teach and get the students involved in that creative process.\u201dArts, Wiggs said, allow students the opportunity to use a part of the brain that might not be accessed in other academic settings.\u201cIt allows people the freedom to think outside the box,\u201d Wiggs said. \u201cWe have so many boxes in our culture. Art is problem-solving. You give an assignment and that\u2019s the problem and then you ask them to solve that problem. If I see a student going off in a different direction but they are creating, they have that freedom. I allow that. Art is not going from point A to B. Art is saying \u2018Here\u2019s your goal, and different kids get there in different ways.\u2019\u201dWiggs might give students an assignment where she asks them to draw something blue.\u201cOK, it can be a blue flower, It can be blue sky. It can be a blue shirt. It can be anything,\u201d Wiggs said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem and they are free to go at it.\u201dThis year, Wiggs is teaching high school and middle school students, but next year she will have elementary students.\u201cTeaching younger students is a whole different ballgame,\u201d Wiggs said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any fear. It\u2019s fun. They are like \u2018Clay, yeah! Colors, yeah! Yellow and black make green? Whoa!\u2019 It\u2019s just fun. They have no fear.\u201dSchool for the Deaf director Michele Handley said it\u2019s been about four years since the school had an art teacher. In the hiring process, Handley was impressed with Wiggs\u2019 passion for teaching.\u201cWhen she would talk about the art curriculum for the high school, you could really see her knowledge of the theory and the mechanics of art,\u201d Handley said. \u201cThe whole time I was listening to her, I was just thinking about how much impact I know she would be able to make.\u201dHandley said the her experiences with art as an elementary school student have influenced her whole life and she wants the same for ENCSD students.\u201cEvery little thing that we do makes their world bigger,\u201d Handley said.___Information from: The Wilson Daily Times, http://www.wilsondaily.com"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-north-america-mark-medoff-movies-entertainment-daecec33c99546cfb4490a9d9ab5ef39", "headline": "'Children of a Lesser God' writer Mark Medoff dies at 79 | AP News", "date": "2019-04-25T01:22:00Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "Mark Medoff, a provocative playwright whose \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d won Tony and Olivier awards and whose screen adaptation of his play earned an Oscar nomination, has died in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

others. In April, he was awarded the Utah County Employee of the Month, an honor that brought a smile to his face and to those of his coworkers.Matt Grant was born with a rare chromosomal abnormality.\u201cThe doctors told me he wouldn\u2019t live very long and he has lived 43 years,\u201d his mother, Carol Grant, said. \u201cThey first said that he would live only a couple of years.\u201dHe lives in a group home, but visits his parents often on weekends and holidays. While he does need some direction, Carol Grant said, he enjoys being independent, staying active playing basketball, bowling and other games. He loves to be around people and enjoys riding his adult tricycle and going four-wheeling with his family.While he is not able to speak, he does understand everything that is spoken to him and is able to communicate well with others by using hand gestures and some sign language, according to Carol Grant.ADVERTISEMENTWith his chromosomal abnormality, some health problems occur. He does have congestive heart failure, but no one would know that because he stays so active and busy, Carol Grant said.Part of his active life has been participating in the Special Olympics for 10 years; Matt Grant ran the torch with police officers for the first few years, according to Carol Grant. While his favorite Olympic sport was bowling, he has also competed in running, swimming and received his first gold medal in skiing.Brightening lives at the Sheriff\u2019s OfficeOver 20 years ago, Matt Grant began accompanying his mom to work in the kitchen at the Utah County Sheriff\u2019s Office, where he was trained before being integrated into the workforce.\u201cHe went with me for three or four years while I worked in the kitchen,\u201d Carol Grant said. \u201cI quit because I couldn\u2019t separate supervisor versus mother.\u201d But, he continued and is still there today. In fact, he has worked for the Sheriff\u2019s Office for 21 years, a job he loves.As a cook assistant, Mattie \u2014 as he is fondly referred to around the Sheriff\u2019s Office, works in the kitchen to help prepare meals for the jail, for Meals on Wheels and for the Code 7 Caf\u00e9. He helps move food trays along and arranges the food carts for the housing units each day.\u201cHe\u2019s the start of the line. He\u2019s the one that controls the pace,\u201d said deputy Jason Heidel, food service administrator. Matt Grant works with the inmates, as well as Sheriff\u2019s Office employees.At the Code 7 Caf\u00e9, named because Code 7 traditionally means \u201cout to lunch\u201d with law enforcement, about 100-140 employees of the Sheriff\u2019s Office come for lunch each day. Because on-duty jail staff members are asked to not leave the building during their shifts, they need a place to eat. About 30 inmates work at the caf\u00e9, where they are trained in the culinary arts.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThe inmate workers are very protective of him,\u201d Heidel said.\u201cThe guy doesn\u2019t forget a face. He has been here over 20 years and he can literally remember every inmate worker who has been here and all of the staff,\u201d Heidel said. As deputies, firefighters and administrators come in to eat each day, Matt Grant moves from table to table, interacting with each of them.\u201cHe likes to walk around and keep everyone in line. He\u2019ll hand out work assignments to the other guys,\u201d Heidel said.Deputy Chris Nielson, food service manager, said that Matt Grant takes his job very seriously. When they go outside to break down the cardboard boxes, he keeps a close eye on the inmate workers. \u201cHe loves watching to make sure nobody\u2019s wandering off.\u201dThe inmate workers also keep a close eye on him, Nielson said, ensuring that everyone is treating him with respect.\u201cHe brings compassion out of the inmate workers,\u201d Nielson said. \u201cThey go out of their way to prepare food how he likes it.\u201d There have been one or two attempts by new inmates to make fun of Matt Grant, but those quickly got stopped by other inmates.\u201cHe loves the job. He loves the inmates. He interacts with them big time,\u201d Carol Grant said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re out and about in the community, and he sees former inmates that he has worked with or other friends, he always remembers them and hugs them.\u201dHe also loves the deputies and other employees at the Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cHe has his favorites,\u201d Carol Grant said. \u201cAt home, he calls them \u2018the fuzz.\u2019\u201dOn the day that Matt Grant was going to receive the \u201cEmployee of the Month\u201d award from the Utah County Commission, he had no idea.\u201cI brought him laundered clothes that day. He kept looking at me like he wondered what was going on,\u201d Carol Grant said. \u201cWhen they announced it, he jumped up, everybody clapped and \u2018yayed.\u2019 He had a ball.\u201dFellow employees nominated him as Employee of the Month and wrote comments about why they thought he should be given the honor. These included his ability to put a smile on everyone\u2019s face when he walks into the room, his talent as a lunch greeter and his strong work ethic.\u201cIf we were all half as happy as he is, everybody would be much better off,\u201d Heidel said."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/nfl-financial-markets-chefs-tn-state-wire-4390fc03939242dbb1abc867bbd8d1e1", "headline": "Titans go vegan thanks to linebacker's wife's culinary skill | AP News", "source": "AP News", "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 It started because Charity Morgan freaked out.She went to Whole Foods and bought every fruit and vegetable she could find, unloading them on the granite counter top in her kitchen.They covered the entire surface, a rainbow of produce. And she stared at them, frozen in uncertainty.It used to be that when someone told her that they were vegan, she automatically rolled her eyes. \u201cLook at this weirdo over here,\u201d she would think. Someone who only ate steamed veggies and salads.It was a ridiculous concept for Morgan, a chef trained in the art of butter and beef. Yet, here she was trying to attempt it.ADVERTISEMENTAs Morgan sized up the mountain of peppers and pears on her kitchen counter, she looked at her then-1-year-old daughter, who with her infant sign language, was exuberantly moving her fingers toward her mouth saying: \u201cEat. Eat. Eat.\u201d The paralysis heightened.\u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe, I was having an anxiety attack,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have chicken nuggets I could just throw in.\u201dShe put her head on the counter and took a deep breath, searching for help.If eating vegan was good enough for her pro athlete husband \u2014 a linebacker for the Tennessee Titans \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t she make that change for her babies, too?\u201cGod, if this is a journey you want me to be on, open up my eyes to something I don\u2019t see.\u201dThen she heard this cynical voice in her head. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Silly, cook what you always cook. Just use different ingredients.\u2019\u201d So she did.She pulled from her memory bank of foods that her family loved to eat. Lasagna. Kung pow shrimp. Jambalaya. Aha! She replicated the Cajun dish, one infused with the flavors of her childhood, and made a veggie version that had all the same savor and spice without the meat.\u201cThat one moment of anxiety peeled my eyes open to see a whole other aspect of food,\u201d she says.Now, Morgan not only cooks a plant-based diet for her family, she has established herself as a go-to vegan chef who creates culinary options good enough to satiate even a 280-pound tackle.Nearly every day, she makes and delivers vegan food to nearly a dozen players at the Titans practice facility. The home-made meals, which far surpass steamed veggies and salads, have enticed athletes looking for ways to improve their on-field performance and their overall health.ADVERTISEMENTHer business is taking off, with celebrity clients stalking her salivating Instagram feed and reaching out in hopes she will cook for them, too. And she is working on a cookbook highlighting her unique creations, which feature flairs of her Creole and Puerto Rican heritage and her days spent cooking as a girl with her mom.Growing up in California, Morgan was her mom\u2019s shadow at the cutting board and next to the stove.\u201cShe was my little right hand in the kitchen,\u201d Migdalia Tirado says of her youngest child, whom she so often sent out to the garden to pull zucchini.In her role as mini sous chef, Morgan would pick blackberries for pie and grate green bananas for the pasilla dish her mom made every Christmas.Together, they would make dishes that blended Jamaican and Filipino essence. They cooked bacalao for traditional fish stew and made sofrito, an aromatic sauce puree with tomatoes and garlic.Morgan would chop and blacken bell peppers, onions and garlic and then freeze them in ice cubes so they would always be prepped and ready when inspiration struck. \u201cShe came up with the flavors,\u201d Tirado says.\u201cShe always was inventive,\u201d Morgan\u2019s older sister Seranequia Duplechan agrees. \u201cShe would take mom\u2019s leftovers and recreate it. She would take cream cheese and add cinnamon and sugar to make frosting on crackers. She would combine rice and cheese and seasoning and make cheese balls.\u201dAnd she wouldn\u2019t always share with her five siblings.\u201cShe was over there eating and making all these delicious sounds,\u201d Morgan\u2019s sister says with a laugh.\u201cShe got really good,\u201d Morgan\u2019s mom adds. \u201cShe got better than me. She upgraded it.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, then, when Morgan went to school at Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts.There, she perfected beef wellington and Shepherd\u2019s pie, and was exposed to incredible ingredients from around the world like purple basil and Chinese eggplant \u2014 but after 15 years as a trained professional, she wasn\u2019t prepared to revert to only plants.It was Morgan\u2019s husband, Derrick, who first experimented with veganism.He gave up meat and dairy for athletic performance, finding he had more energy and less inflammation after really strenuous workouts. And Charity Morgan, who often cooked for her husband at home, started making vegan meals to send with him to the practice facility \u2014 a place where meat was often the basis for every meal.She would make crispy black bean and vegan cheeze flautas, buffalo vegan chik\u2019n wraps, pulled \u201cpork\u201d sandwiches pilled high with BBQ jackfruit shredded like the meat would be.When fellow Titans players started stealing Derrick Morgan\u2019s food at lunch and remarking on how delicious it was, a few of the pro football players went vegan, too.Jurrell Casey and DaQuan Jones started first. Then came Wesley Woodyard, Brian Orakpo and DeMarco Murray. Last season, Charity Morgan suddenly found she was making meals for 12 players.Meanwhile, at home, she was still cooking fish filet for herself and her children while Derrick went plants only. That\u2019s when she decided to try it, too.\u201cIf the greatest athletes of all time have been plant-based, then guess what, we\u2019re going to be that,\u201d Morgan says, recalling the transition.Titans players say the fuel helps them recover faster and play better. They are not alone. Quarterback Tom Brady has spoken about his meatless, dairy-free diet. As have a handful of NBA stars, including Kyrie Irving, as well as tennis goddess Venus Williams.\u201cThey opened up my eyes to something I didn\u2019t see,\u201d she says.As she educated herself, she learned there are two type of vegans \u2014 people who eat vegan for the health benefits and those who make the change because they care about animals and the environment.Her dad always used to say: \u201cAll streams lead to the same water.\u201d\u201cWhether you are doing it for ethical reasons or doing it for personal reasons it\u2019s the same outcome,\u201d she says now. You become a healthier human.There are vegan chefs, she says, who started as vegetarians or who were raised vegan and haven\u2019t had meat in 20 years.\u201cThey don\u2019t know how to make a Vietnamese fish sauce because they haven\u2019t had it,\u201d she says.Morgan\u2019s not that. \u201cI\u2019m a chef that went vegan,\u201d she says.She knows what it tastes like because she cooked it. She ate it.The first thing she did when she made the transition to vegan eating was have her sister ship her all her cookbooks from Le Cordon Bleu culinary school, where she learned her skills as a chef.She replicates all the flavors from those pages that people are used to tasting \u2014 but she achieves it with nature. She can make that fishy flavor, for example, with kelp powder.\u201cYeah, God gave us everything we need in plants,\u201d she says with a smile.No longer does she panic over what to do with vegetables. She gushes over avocado crema or roasted red pepper hummus or a home-made \u201csour cream\u201d made of nuts.\u201cThere are over 22,000 plants,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is my canvas. Those are my tools.\u201dDuring training camp this year, her client list grew. She made lunch, dinner, a snack and a protein shake for 18 players, plus retired Titans Cortland Finnegan and Blaine Bishop.Lunch may be \u201cvegan beef\u201d and potato enchiladas, elote corn with slow simmered black beans or Spanish rice. Snacks could include spinach artichoke roll ups, plus a dip, which is one of Morgan\u2019s specialties.They would also get dessert once a week \u2014 after weigh ins. Her foods may be plant-based, but they are also calorie dense.Morgan\u2019s clients never have the same thing twice, unless they request it. \u201cI am always looking for the next recipe,\u201d Morgan says.Those recipes are like works of art, and they have set Morgan apart in many ways.\u201cIt\u2019s totally something that cannot be taught,\u201d Morgan\u2019s best friend, Danielle Frost says. \u201cShe\u2019s creatively gifted when it comes to food.\u201cShe\u2019s been able to transition guys used to eating meat but turning everyday meals into plant-based meals, and the guys are saying they aren\u2019t missing anything.\u201cShe\u2019s definitely created a lane of her own and pioneered a space. It\u2019s not your typical vegan food.\u201dOthers are taking notice. Morgan now has two clients \u2014 outside the athletic world \u2014 that she cooks for every week. One, from a music group we would all know, though she won\u2019t disclose who.When the artist\u2019s assistant stops by, Morgan presents her with vegan cookies and cream cheese cake and raves about the vegan chicken and dumplings she made.Her days are filled with such creations. Morgan is in her home\u2019s commercial kitchen by 6:30 nearly every morning, making sauces from soaked cashews, chopping chipotle peppers, turning on the grill or the fryer or the steamer.Now, her own children fight over broccoli. Her daughter plays with Kale scraps and her son helps her harvest romaine from their own garden, just like she did as a girl with her mother.As she thinks of it, she reflects back on when the seed for cooking was planted for her.\u201cI still wonder if it was the creation aspect of it or spending time with my mom that grew my love for it,\u201d Morgan says.And when Morgan\u2019s mom comes from the West Coast to visit Tennessee, they still find the rhythm they had back all those years ago.\u201cIt looks like a dance,\u201d Tirado says. \u201cWe just know.\u201cIt\u2019s my best days. I love being in the kitchen with Charity.\u201d\u201cHer foods,\u201d her sister says, \u201care healing.\u201d___Information from: The Tennessean, http://www.tennessean.com", "date": "2019-01-06T16:04:06Z"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/0362e0b23bc14492b05e166d9b176567", "headline": "BC-BKC--NCAA-West Region Preview,1st Ld-Writethru | AP News", "source": "AP News", "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Gonzaga enters the NCAA Tournament following a loss for one of the rare times under coach Mark Few.The dominant team in the West Coast Conference for two decades, the Zags lost to Saint Mary\u2019s in the conference title game last week in Las Vegas.The players have put it behind them.Few hasn\u2019t completely \u2014 and may never.\u201cI would say that is definitely not my strong suit,\u201d Few said Wednesday. \u201cAs a flawed human being, that would be an area I can work on better.\u201dGonzaga never was able to establish its up-tempo style in the title game and the Gaels rolled to a 60-47 win to earn the conference\u2019s automatic NCAA Tournament bid. The loss ended the Zags\u2019 21-game winning streak and their six-year reign as WCC tournament champions, but didn\u2019t dissuade the NCAA Tournament selection committee from giving them the No. 1 seed in the West Region.ADVERTISEMENTGonzaga (30-3) opens tournament play Thursday in Salt Lake City against No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson (21-13).The Zags are expected to roll over the Knights, but will take nothing for granted, particularly after seeing No. 1 Virginia lose to No. 16 Maryland-Baltimore County a year ago at this stage. Gonzaga also is entering the NCAA Tournament after a loss for the first time since 2012.\u201cAs a one seed, everyone is coming after you and they want to beat you,\u201d Gonzaga guard Josh Perkins said. \u201cThey will come in here with nothing to lose, play with reckless abandon. Being a one seed, we have to know that going in and master intensity and control what we can control.\u201dThe Knights twice trailed by 13 in their First Four game against Prairie View A&M before rallying for an 82-76 victory and the program\u2019s first NCAA Tournament win.Fairleigh Dickinson coach Greg Herenda, who was ill with life-threatening blood clots less than a year ago, danced on the court following the victory, but quickly turned his attention to Gonzaga. The Knights arrived in Salt Lake City late Tuesday night and had their team meeting at 2 a.m. before practicing Wednesday afternoon.\u201cWe have to stop celebrating,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to celebrate the first NCAA victory for Fairleigh Dickinson University for the rest of your lives. Now we have 24 hours to prepare for a team that is really, really good.\u201dHOWARD SUSPENDED: Syracuse will play its first NCAA Tournament game since 2016 without one of its key players.The school announced Wednesday that senior guard Frank Howard is out \u201cfor an indefinite period of time\u201d for violating school policy.ADVERTISEMENTThe 6-foot-5 Howard lit up social media during the ACC tournament against Duke last week when he appeared to stick his foot out as Blue Devils star Zion Williamson ran by. Howard denied trying to trip Williamson and the school did not say if the suspension was related to the alleged attempt.Howard had an up-and-down season, but scored 28 points against Duke and played well in the ACC tournament with Tyus Battle out due to an injury. He averages 8.9 points and 2.0 assists.Syracuse plays Baylor on Thursday in Salt Lake City.FAMILIAR TERRITORY: For the second straight season, Murray State finds itself in a 5-12 game in the NCAA Tournament.The Racers lost 85-68 to West Virginia in the first round last year in San Diego and hope the experience makes them better prepared for another tournament game. Murray State is the 12 seed against fifth-seeded Marquette in a West Region game being played in Hartford on Thursday.Star guard Ja Morant was a freshman on last year\u2019s Murray State team and Ohio Valley Conference defensive player of the year Shaq Buchanan was a junior. Forward Brion Sanchious was also a starter on last year\u2019s team.Morant had 14 points on 5 for 10 shooting and three blocked shots against West Virginia, and Buchanan managed just six points.\u201cI would say last year was our first time so guys are happy to be there,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cBut this year with me and Ja and Brion, we have the focus that we can go far in this tournament. We have the team to do it.\u201dMurray State is making its 17th NCAA Tournament appearance. The Racers have won three first-round games, beating North Carolina State in 1988, Vanderbilt in 2010 and Colorado State in 2012.COMMUNICATING CATAMOUNTS: Vermont coach John Becker believes a key to his program\u2019s success has been his ability to communicate.Becker learned the value of that as an assistant and later head coach in the 1990s at Gallaudet University, where his athletes were deaf or hearing impaired and he had to learn sign language to get his points across.\u201cWe take for granted that communication piece,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I never have since then. We over-communicate in our program here and we understand the importance of that and the value of that and how easy it is for us.\u201dThe No. 13 seeded Catamounts (27-6) take on No. 4 seed Florida State (27-7) Thursday in Hartford.Communication and help defense will be important for a team whose big man, Anthony Lamb, is 6-foot-6. The Seminoles have three starters taller than that, including 7-4 Christ Koumadje, and 6-10 Mfiondu Kabengele, the ACC sixth man of the year, coming off the bench.MONTANA-MICHIGAN REMATCH: No. 15 seed Montana (26-8) has the full attention of Michigan coach John Beilein. The teams are meeting in the first round for the second straight year.Michigan (28-6) won 61-47 in 2018, but the game was not without some drama.\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t go the way it did last year,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were ahead of us 10-0 to the start the game, and they have a lot of guys back. We are a little brand new to playing in this type of game. They know Montana is even better than they were last year.\u201dThe Grizzlies, who won the Big Sky regular-season title and tournament, are 15-point underdogs.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a few games where the bull\u2019s eye wasn\u2019t on our backs, and those were the ones that our guys performed best at, whether we were on the road or we found ourselves in second or third in the standings and we were trying to get back to the top,\u201d Montana coach Travis DeCuire said. \u201cWe played with a high level of desperation. I think for a rematch our guys will go into the game the same way.\u201dWOLF PACK GATOR BAIT?: Jalen Hudson of Florida (19-15) didn\u2019t sound like a man whose team is the lower seed for its game against Nevada (29-4) in Des Moines.\u201cThey\u2019re a very experienced team. Obviously, they have had a lot of success,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cThey are a mid-major team, though. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve seen a team like us in a long time.\u201dGranted, the seventh-seeded Wolf Pack (29-4) of the Mountain West haven\u2019t played the most rigorous schedule, but they are 3-0 against Pac-12 opponents Southern California, Arizona State and Utah.___AP Sports Writers Ralph Russo and Pat Eaton-Robb in Harford, and Eric Olson in Des Moines contributed to this story.___More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "date": "2019-03-20T23:31:41Z"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-education-huntington-games-ad7b87cbabeb4b7e8a2e25a7f3f5f92e", "headline": "Program aims to launch esports league in West Virginia | AP News", "date": "2019-02-27T03:28:21Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "HUNTINGTON - The world of esports may soon be coming to high schools statewide as the West Virginia Career and Technical Education office has announced the launch of an esports pilot program, which could include up to 16 schools from around the Mountain State.Esports - or competitive video gaming - has exploded in popularity over the past five years. In fact, the World Championship of League of Legends drew in more viewers worldwide than the NBA finals, the Super Bowl or the FIFA World Cup. Professional players make millions a year playing.

CTE Administrator and de-facto esports coach Will Totten said about 15 students expressed serious interest in participating.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cWhat I personally love about esports is that it gives the opportunity for students that typically may not get involved in traditional athletics to get involved with the school in a team-based atmosphere,\u201d Totten said.\u201cThese students will still get many of the benefits of joining a traditional athletic team such as being dependable, displaying sportsmanship, taking feedback, playing a position and fulfilling a role as well as slightly more esports-specific benefits of problem solving, critical/creative thinking, and strong communication between team members.\u201dSVHS, the Cabell County Career and Technology Center, and the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind have each agreed to participate in the pilot program. The WVDE CTE office is looking for at least 16 schools to participate for the coming year, and is allowing more than one team per school to participate.This year, esports will be classified as a school club.

A robot rolled in and a doctor appeared on the video screen.Wilharm figured the visit was routine. She was astonished by what the doctor started saying.\u201cThis guy cannot breathe, and he\u2019s got this robot trying to talk to him,\u201d she said. \u201cMeanwhile, this guy is telling him, \u2018So we\u2019ve got your results back, and there\u2019s no lung left.

Brim wrestled a knife away from Williams and used it to fatally stab him Tuesday, according to Bay Area Transit Police.ADVERTISEMENTHumphrey, a nursing student who uses a wheelchair, said several passengers begged Brim to stop but he did not listen and stabbed Williams in the neck at least five times.She said other passengers fled the train when it pulled into the station, but Humphrey and another passenger stayed.Humphrey, who is legally deaf but can read lips, said she texted police to stop the train and send an ambulance. After the train pulled into the station, Humphrey saw Brim flee, strip off his blue hoodie and run down the stairs.Brim was wearing only pants when he was arrested near the station after authorities said he tried to steal a van at a car dealership.He was charged Thursday with murder, two counts of attempted second-degree robbery and two counts of attempted carjacking.

Sham was on his way to an evening meeting in Kowloon when the four or five attackers pounced, leaving him with bloody head injuries but conscious, the Front said on its Facebook page.It suggested the assault was politically motivated, linked \u201cto a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights.\u201dEarlier in the day, pro-democracy lawmakers yelling that she is \u201cthe mother of the mafia police\u201d forced Lam to stop delivering her annual policy address, causing her to walk out of the Legislative Council.The hostile reception marked another slap in the face for the embattled chief executive grappling with the demonstrations and accompanying violence that have undermined her leadership, wrecked trust in the police and opened festering bitterness between opponents and supporters of the protest movement.As she started to speak, chanting lawmakers held aloft placards suggesting Lam has blood on her hands.

One lawmaker wearing a paper mask with the face of Chinese President Xi Jinping tossed a placard as Lam walked out.After two thwarted attempts, unable to continue through the ruckus, Lam fell back on Plan B: delivering the speech 75 minutes late by video link, standing ramrod-straight with China\u2019s yellow-starred red flag to her right and Hong Kong\u2019s flag on her left.Describing the territory as going through \u201cmajor crisis,\u201d Lam said, \u201cPeople are asking: Will Hong Kong return to normal?\u201dShe appealed for its 7.5 million citizens to \u201ccherish the city,\u201d warning that \u201ccontinued violence and spread of hatred will erode the core values of Hong Kong.\u201dBut with its focus on such minutiae as building new tunnels and freeing up land for housing, the 50-minute speech titled \u201cTreasure Hong Kong our home\u201d only fueled criticism that Lam is deaf to protesters\u2019 concerns about the future of the territory\u2019s freedoms, unique in China.In a subsequent news conference, Lam again made clear that she wouldn\u2019t resign and insisted there has been no erosion \u201cwhatsoever\u201d of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms.\u201cHong Kong is still a very free society,\u201d she said.Even before Lam delivered her speech, one of the protesting lawmakers, Claudia Mo, dismissed it as a \u201cshame and a sham\u201d and said the chief executive had lost all authority.\u201cShe is just a puppet on strings, being played by Beijing,\u201d Mo said at an impromptu news conference with other lawmakers outside the chamber after they successfully thwarted Lam\u2019s address there.ADVERTISEMENTThey played a recording on a small loudspeaker that they said was the sound of police tear-gassing protesters and of protesters\u2019 wails.\u201cThese are the voices of people screaming and they are just ordinary Hong Kong people,\u201d said lawmaker Tanya Chan. \u201cPlease, please, please Mrs. Carrie Lam, don\u2019t let us suffer any more.\u201dShe and others called for Lam\u2019s resignation. \u201cThis is the only way that we can have a good future,\u201d said Chan.Pro-Beijing legislators condemned the disruption, among them Martin Liao, who called it \u201ctotally unforgivable.\u201dLam had been bracing for trouble in the legislature, given the fury whipped by the protests that started in June over a contested extradition bill and have grown into a full-blown tornado of sustained anti-government, anti-police and anti-China anger.The widespread use of tear gas by riot-control squads and 2,600 arrests, widely decried as heavy-handed, have triggered public disgust with the 30,000-strong police force. Hardcore black-clad and masked protesters have responded with widespread vandalism of China-linked businesses, subway stations and other targets, and attacked police with gasoline bombs and other weapons.This month, two police shootings that injured teenage protesters, the stabbing of a police officer, and the detonation of a small, remote-controlled bomb close to police officers ratcheted up violence to levels unprecedented since the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.Saying rioters are \u201cspreading chaos and fear,\u201d Lam appealed for order and sought to end her address on a positive note. Her Facebook profile was updated before she spoke, with a photo of a smiling Lam against a backdrop of a rainbow over Hong Kong\u2019s harbor.\u201cWe have to put aside differences and stop attacking each other,\u201d she said. \u201cI thoroughly believe that Hong Kong will be able to ride out this storm and move on.\u201d", "date": "2019-10-16T15:00:11Z"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/prince-andrew-entertainment-business-new-york-new-york-city-9b16f814a9594dac9bc4524f6ca5374d", "headline": "UK's disgraced Prince Andrew faces uncertain role in future | AP News", "date": "2019-11-22T18:42:37Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Prince Andrew is scaling back travel and facing an uncertain future as he steps away from the royal role he has embraced for his entire adult life.The latest blow came Friday afternoon when the board of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra announced that it was cutting ties to Andrew, who had been its patron, and Barclays said it would no longer be involved with Andrew\u2019s prized Pitch@Palace enterprise.The 59-year-old prince has suffered numerous setbacks in the six days since the broadcast of a disastrous TV interview from Buckingham Palace during which he defended his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, who was facing new sex crimes charges, died in a New York prison in August in what the New York City medical examiner ruled was a suicide.ADVERTISEMENTThe Times newspaper said in an editorial Friday that the debacle demonstrates the need for \u201curgent reform\u201d of the royal household. The paper urged Andrew\u2019s older brother and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, to take steps to streamline and make the royal family \u201cmore modest.\u201dThe disgraced prince scuttled plans for a trip to Bahrain that had been planned to support his Pitch@Palace project, according to the British news media, even though he is struggling to keep that enterprise going despite cutting ties to dozens of other charities.Those hopes suffered a setback Friday evening when one of the charity\u2019s official corporate sponsors said it would no longer participate \u201cin light of the current situation.\u201dAndrew did go horseback riding with his mother, 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth II, near Windsor Castle on Friday afternoon despite the harsh November weather. The monarch has not commented publicly on her son\u2019s troubles.There was a visceral public backlash to his TV interview \u2014 particularly because Andrew did not express sympathy for Epstein\u2019s young female victims \u2014 that led leading British politicians to comment on the future of the monarchy in a televised debate ahead of the Dec. 12 national election.Shortly after the interview, Andrew announced that he was halting his royal duties \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201dUp until now, Andrew, the queen\u2019s third child, had been able to skate away from troublesome questions about his private life and his extravagant lifestyle. His association with Epstein had been known for more than eight years, but it only took him down after he went on TV to discuss it.ADVERTISEMENTAndrew is trying to find a way to keep alive at least one of his projects without relying on the prestige \u2014 and real estate \u2014 of the royal family.Buckingham Palace officials said Andrew would try to maintain Pitch@Palace as a non-royal charity that eventually would not be centered at any of the royal palaces. The prince founded the project in 2014 to link up young entrepreneurs with established businesspeople. In the past, ideas and product pitches for the program have taken place at St. James\u2019 Palace.According to its website, Pitch@Palace has helped 931 start-up businesses and created nearly 6,000 new jobs. It boasts a 97% survival rate for new companies started by its alumni.Andrew was expected to remove himself from the many other charities with which he\u2019s been involved over the years, a diverse group that sheds light on his interests and reflects the varied demands made on a senior royal.Among them have been the Army Officers\u2019 Golfing Society, which promotes golf in the British Army, and the Maimonides Interfaith Foundation, which is devoted to the use of art and dialogue to improve relations between Jews, Muslims and Christians.The prince also was involved with a group fighting malaria and a charity helping deaf children throughout the Commonwealth, which includes Britain and many of its former colonies.The Falklands War veteran also was expected to drop his ceremonial role with many military units. In addition, he has resigned as patron of The Outward Bound Trust, an educational charity that helps young people have adventures in the wild, which he had been involved with for decades, and was to step down as chancellor of Huddersfield University, officials said.Despite these many embarrassments and the dramatic drop in his work responsibilities, Andrew was not expected to face money pressures, although the details of his financial picture have not been made public.He has long received financial backing from the queen\u2019s private accounts and there was no indication that this would change. He was likely, however, to close or severely downsize his well-staffed personal office at Buckingham Palace.When he served as Britain\u2019s international trade envoy, Andrew relied extensively on public funding and was criticized for his deluxe travel style when going overseas on official business. He left that role in 2011, in part because questions were already being asked about his relationship with Epstein, who had already been convicted of sex offenses."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-us-news-police-shootings-chicago-ec50dc0fda874f5d897119709baa44e2", "headline": "The Latest: McDonald relative calls sentence partial victory | AP News", "date": "2019-01-19T01:14:11Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the sentencing of the Chicago police officer who fired the shots that killed black teenager Laquan McDonald (all times local):7:15 p.m.Laquan McDonald\u2019s great-uncle says that although it\u2019s a partial victory that the former Chicago police officer who killed the black teen received any prison time, it\u2019s still a sad day for the country and its justice system.The Rev.

Luces, who is deaf, said through a sign language interpreter that he was pulled over by two officers, one black and one white. But when asked to identify the white officer in the courtroom, Luces said he couldn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t have his glasses.The judge allowed Luces to walk around the courtroom, but he still wasn\u2019t able to pick out Van Dyke even though the former officer was wearing a bright yellow jail jumpsuit. Van Dyke has grown a bushy beard and mustache since he was convicted in October of second-degree murder and aggravated battery.___2 p.m.A relative of Laquan McDonald has been allowed to read a victim impact statement from the slain black teen\u2019s perspective, saying Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke killed his grandnephew without provocation.Reading from a prepared text in the first person as Laquan McDonald on Friday, the Rev.

He has not just destroyed my life but the life of his wife and children.\u201dIn asking for a stiff sentence for Van Dyke, he said: \u201cWhy should this person who ended my life forever ... who has never asked for forgiveness ... be free when I am dead for forever?\u201dVan Dyke was convicted in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time he shot McDonald.___12:40 p.m.Several black men called to testify during the sentencing hearing of the Chicago police officer who killed black teenager Laquan McDonald have described their own run-ins with the officer during traffic stops.Vidale Joy told the court Friday that Jason Van Dyke used a racial slur and put a gun to his head during a 2005 stop. He said Van Dyke \u201clooked infuriated\u201d and seemed \u201cout of his mind.\u201d Under cross examination, Joy conceded that he didn\u2019t allege in his first accounts of the traffic stop that Van Dyke had used a slur.Witness Ed Nance wept as he testified that he hasn\u2019t been the same since a 2007 stop. He says Van Dyke pulled him by the arms to the squad car while he was handcuffed and that he has undergone three surgeries to his shoulders as a result. He also says he has PTSD from the incident.___11:50 a.m.Attorneys at the sentencing hearing for the Chicago police officer who killed black teenager Laquan McDonald have made their arguments about which charge he faces is the most serious.Judge Vincent Gaughan\u2019s decision on whether Jason Van Dyke\u2019s second-degree murder or aggravated battery conviction is more serious will help determine the severity of the sentence.In Illinois, judges are typically required to sentence defendants for the most serious crime for which they\u2019re convicted.The defense wants Van Dyke to be sentenced for the second-degree murder charge, partly because it carries a shorter mandatory minimum prison term of four years.Prosecutors want the judge to focus on the 16 aggravated battery counts. Each carries a mandatory minimum prison term of six years and sentences for each count may have to be served consecutively instead of concurrently.___9:50 a.m.The sentencing hearing has begun for the Chicago police officer who killed black teenager Laquan McDonald in 2014.Jason Van Dyke, who was booted from the force once he was convicted, was led into court Friday in a yellow jail jumpsuit. His wife and two daughters are at the hearing.Judge Vincent Gaughan says he\u2019ll first hear legal arguments about which is the more serious charge against Van Dyke, who was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time he shot McDonald. If he decides the murder charge is more serious, that could lead to a lesser sentence under a complex sentencing equation.After that legal issue is settled, attorneys will call witnesses to make the case for aggravating or mitigating circumstances before making their final arguments.___12:05 a.m.A judge rejected allegations that the shocking video of Laquan McDonald\u2019s death proved that police officers staged a cover-up in the fatal shooting of the black teen.Now another judge must decide how long the officer who pulled the trigger spends behind bars. Jason Van Dyke was convicted in October of second-degree murder and aggravated battery. He will likely be given prison time when he\u2019s sentenced Friday.But critics of the police department who cheered Van Dyke\u2019s conviction are worried after a judge on Thursday acquitted three officers accused of trying to conceal what happened to protect their colleague. He was the first Chicago officer found guilty in an on-duty shooting in a half century and probably the first ever in the shooting of an African-American.___For more stories about this case, visit AP\u2019s Laquan McDonald hub"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/58c5bdec74b44433b9de420f521db6e2", "headline": "Texas scuba diver scours rivers for lost valuables, returns | AP News", "date": "2019-07-19T13:02:44Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas (AP) \u2014 Chris Young is the water world version of St. Anthony of Padua, the patron saint of lost things.The San Antonio Express-News reports the diver for hire regularly patrols the Comal, Guadalupe and San Marcos rivers on his own in search of phones, wedding rings, sunglasses and other valuables accidentally dropped into the murky drink by river tubers.Up to four times a week for four to five hours a day during tubing season, Young dons a wetsuit, tanks and mask and dives in hunting for sunken treasures.

Blocker, a profoundly deaf special education teacher who relies on his phone\u2019s sound-amplifying technology, was devastated.Fortunately, the case it was in really was waterproof, so when Young pulled it from the river bottom, it still powered on.\u201cA lot of people put them in Ziploc bags and think that\u2019ll keep the water out,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201dThe next day, Blocker, who\u2019d already gotten a replacement phone, (this time with insurance), was surprised and thrilled to receive a Facebook message from Young telling him he\u2019d found the phone.\u201cHe\u2019d filled out his Medical ID on the phone, and that had his name and where he lived right there on the lock screen,\u201d Young said. \u201cSo I was able to track him down on Facebook.\u201dWhen he finds an item without a name, number or any other identifying information, he\u2019ll put a description \u2014 but not a photo \u2014 on his Facebook page, asking people to contact him if they think it\u2019s theirs. If they can describe it, such as telling him the kind of case the phone is in or what the lock screen image is, it\u2019s theirs.\u201cSometimes people even give me their passwords to see if it\u2019ll open the phone.\u201dWhen he finds something for someone who hasn\u2019t hired him, Young hopes he can rely on their kindness and generosity. Blocker\u2019s dad, for example, gave him $50.Not everyone is so considerate. Some will meet him (always in a public spot for the safety of all concerned) take their property and drive away with barely more than a howdy-do. And sometimes not even a thank you.Young said he prefers diving in the morning, before the water gets stirred up by hordes of tubers and when he has the river virtually to himself.Diving a river is hard work. The water flows slowly but relentlessly, so it requires a lot of strength to navigate, whether skimming above the riverbed, crossing from one side to the other or fighting to swim upstream.\u201cHe\u2019s usually exhausted by the time he gets out of the water,\u201d said Teresa Martin, a friend who accompanied Young on one recent morning treasure hunt.He avoids reaching into the myriophyllum plants that grow along the bottom and look like tiny forests waving in the breeze, ever since he pushed some aside to reveal a snapping turtle unhappy about being disturbed.On a recent morning Young found plenty of loot: a set of keys, a couple of T-shirts, a few chanclas and river shoes, the top to a Yeti tumbler and, several yards away, the tumbler itself. And he found yet another iPhone not in a case, watertight or otherwise. It was bricked. Useless.Young will keep most of what he finds for at least two weeks, selling some of what remains unclaimed and donating the rest to Goodwill or a local senior center. As for the dead phone, he knows someone who\u2019ll buy them to salvage the valuable metals they contain.This is all perfectly legal, a sort of finders keepers, loser weepers situation, according to David Ferguson, communications coordinator with the New Braunfels Police Department.\u201cAnything you find in the water is considered abandoned property,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cYou have no duty other than the moral duty to try to find an item\u2019s original owner.\u201d___Information from: San Antonio Express-News, http://www.mysanantonio.com"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/religion-new-mexico-us-news-ap-top-news-santa-fe-cd8fa374e7914d6c8ef09e9f8bc02ab8", "headline": "Fugitive ex-priest sentenced to 30 years in sex abuse case | AP News", "date": "2019-09-13T23:05:27Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 A former Roman Catholic priest who fled the country decades ago was sentenced Friday in New Mexico to 30 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy at a veterans\u2019 cemetery and military base.In ordering the sentence, U.S. District Judge Martha Vazquez said it was the worst case of child sex abuse she has handled over the course of 26 years.At one point, the judge demanded that 81-year-old defendant Arthur Perrault look a woman in the eyes as she testified about being abused by him.The judge also condemned Perrault for only being concerned about his sexual needs.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cYou chose as a profession the life of being a priest. It was supposed to be your job to help, not destroy,\u201d she said.Prosecutors had asked the judge for special consideration of a life sentence for Perrault, once a pastor at an Albuquerque parish and a chaplain at Kirtland Air Force Base.He was convicted in April of six counts of aggravated sexual abuse and one count of abusive sexual contact with a minor under 12.\u201cIt is a long sentence but certainly a fitting one given the length of his conduct and devastating impact,\u201d U.S. Attorney John Anderson said.Perrault pleaded not guilty after he was returned to the U.S. from Morocco in 2017 and maintained his innocence at the sentencing. His defense team plans to file an appeal.The abuse counts stemmed from the treatment of one boy at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque and at Santa Fe National Cemetery. The two sites are within federal jurisdiction, which allowed U.S. authorities to file charges with no statute of limitations.Several people who were not involved in the specific charges were allowed Friday to recount abuse by Perrault and describe their emotional and mental anguish.Elaine Montoya said her first kiss came from Perrault at the start of a two-year sexual relationship.\u201cHe had convinced me that it was normal ... a gift from God,\u201d she told the court.Charles Starzynski said his first sexual experience was with Perrault instead of any of the girls he liked. He called the former priest a con man concerned only with his image of sophistication.\u201cYou\u2019re just a jerk,\u201d he said.In his only comments, Perrault said he had not made initial eye contact with the people who testified because he is hard of hearing and was watching a computer to read transcriptions of what was being said.He declined several opportunities to make other remarks.Authorities say their decades-long pursuit of Perrault led them to Morocco \u2014 a country that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States \u2014 and showed how far they were willing to go to seek justice.Perrault was in jail at the time and Moroccan officials decided to honor an arrest warrant presented by U.S. authorities.Perrault is among more than 70 clergy members identified by the Santa Fe Archdiocese as credibly accused of abusing children in New Mexico.The archdiocese is in bankruptcy proceedings as a result of the abuse scandal.Perrault first arrived in New Mexico in the 1960s after church officials in Connecticut sent him to a center that treated priests accused of abuse. Located in the Jemez Mountains north of Albuquerque, the facility was operated by the Servants of the Paraclete religious order.Prosecutors wrote in a recent court filing that they had tried Perrault on a \u201csmall fraction\u201d of his crimes, saying he had many more victims. At trial, several men testified that he abused them as children in his car, a church rectory and other locations.The victim at the center of the prosecutors\u2019 case said Perrault took him on excursions to amusement parks and to the military base in Albuquerque and had touched him inappropriately as many as 100 times starting when he was 10.The abuse ended in 1992, the year Perrault left the state. An attorney had been preparing two lawsuits at the time against the Archdiocese of Santa Fe alleging Perrault had sexually assaulted seven children.___This story has been corrected to say Perrault was ordered to look a woman in the eyes as she testified, not three men."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-international-news-the-holocaust-poland-middle-east-c7b009168ee343e18e06202365ece0d7", "headline": "Polish PM cancels Israel visit amid new Holocaust tensions | AP News", "date": "2019-02-17T20:21:36Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki canceled his plans to attend a meeting of central European leaders in Israel starting Monday amid new tensions over how Polish behavior during the Holocaust is remembered and characterized.Morawiecki informed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s of his decision by phone Sunday, Michal Dworczyk, who heads the prime minister\u2019s chancellery, said. Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, plans to attend instead, he said.ADVERTISEMENTIt \u201cis a signal that the historical truth is a fundamental issue for Poland, and the defense of the good name of Poland is and always will be decisive,\u201d Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek explained.Netanyahu said Thursday during a Middle East conference hosted by the United States and Poland that \u201cPoles cooperated with the Nazis\u201d - wording suggesting that some Poles participated in killing Jews during the German occupation of Poland.He was initially quoted by some Israeli media outlets as saying not \u201cPoles\u201d but \u201cThe Poles\u201d cooperated, phrasing which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation.Netanyahu\u2019s office said he was misquoted. The Polish government summoned the Israeli ambassador on Friday and later said it was not satisfied with the explanation of the Israeli leader being quoted incorrectly.Netanyahu was supposed to meet with the leaders of the four central European countries known as the Visegrad Group \u2014 Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia \u2014 during the two-day meeting in Israel.This incident follows a major spat that Warsaw and Jerusalem had last year over a new Polish law that makes it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust.At the height of the crisis, Morawiecki at one point equated Polish perpetrators of the Holocaust to supposed \u201cJewish perpetrators.\u201dNow, with general and European elections later this year, Morawiecki bowed out of the Jerusalem trip because he \u201chas to think about the far-right and anti-Semitic electorate,\u201d said Tomasz Lis, the editor of the Polish edition of Newsweek and a critic of the government.Germany occupied Poland in 1939, annexing part of it to Germany and directly governing the rest. Unlike other countries occupied by Germany, Poland did not have a collaborationist government.ADVERTISEMENTThe prewar Polish government and military fled into exile, and an underground resistance army fought the Nazis inside the country and tried to warn a deaf world about the Holocaust. Thousands of Poles also risked their own lives to help Jews.Because of that history, Poles find references to Polish \u201ccollaboration\u201d to be unfair and hurtful.However, individual Poles did take part in killing Jews during and after the war. Many Holocaust survivors and their relatives carry painful memories of persecution at Polish hands. In Israel, there has been anger at what many there perceive to be Polish attempts today to whitewash that history.The dispute last sparked an explosion of anti-Semitic hate speech in Poland, and there were signs of another spike in recent days."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/health-ogden-utah-us-news-ap-top-news-1f5f240794e1473d80be00465b4b519b", "headline": "Finding Victory: Speaking out for intersex girl after attack | AP News", "date": "2019-06-10T21:45:39Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "OGDEN, Utah (AP) \u2014 When doctors said her youngest child would be a girl, Amie Schofield chose the name Victoria. Then doctors said the child would be a boy, so she switched to Victor.It turned out neither was exactly right. The blue-eyed baby was intersex, with both male and female traits.So Schofield and her husband decided to call the infant Victory. The name is a hope for triumph over the secrecy and shame and the pain and discrimination suffered by intersex people.Amie Schofield knows the suffering better than most: This was not her first intersex child.Some two decades earlier, she gave birth to another child whose body did not align with common expectations of boys or girls. Schofield agreed to have that child undergo surgery that tipped the scales of gender to masculine.ADVERTISEMENTBut the operation did not settle the issue of gender in the child\u2019s mind, or protect them from a savage beating decades later.With Victory, Schofield has been given an opportunity to try again. Her parents want her to be accepted for who she is. Instead of changing Victory, they are intent on changing the world so it is more accepting of intersex people.\u201cWhat I hope is what every parent hopes for their kid,\u201d Schofield said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want her to look at herself and think there\u2019s something wrong just because she\u2019s different.\u201d___Amie first married when she was young, and had her first child more than 20 years ago. Instead of having one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, as men have, or two X chromosomes, as is typically female, the child had two X\u2019s and a Y.Intersex people are not to be confused with transgender. Intersex is an umbrella term for a number of conditions where internal or external sex characteristics aren\u2019t exactly like typical male or female bodies. They are a larger group than is commonly acknowledged; estimates range from about 3 in every 200 births to 1 in 2,000.\u201cI\u2019m convinced every single person on this planet has met someone who\u2019s intersex,\u201d said Georgiann Davis, a sociologist at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas who is intersex and is the board president of interACT: Advocates for Intersex Youth.Some intersex conditions are known to run in families, though that\u2019s rare for XXY chromosomes, said Dr. Adrian Dobs, director of the Klinefelter Center at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Not everyone with the disorder is considered intersex, and most identify as male.ADVERTISEMENTDoctors have long performed surgery and administered hormones to intersex kids to make their bodies more like typical boys or girls, but there\u2019s a growing pushback. Five states have considered banning surgery until they\u2019re old enough to consent, citing serious potential side effects, but most bills have stalled amid pushback from doctors\u2019 groups who say the proposals go too far.Amie took doctors\u2019 advice and raised her first baby as a boy, agreeing to surgery to bring down undescended testicles.But the onset of puberty brought hips and breasts, something that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by other teenagers in the small Idaho town where mother and child lived at the time.\u201cIt\u2019s not something I really thought about until they started making fun of me,\u201d said Amie\u2019s eldest, speaking on condition of anonymity because of fear of violence.The teenager developed a kind of armor: binders and sports bras, then layers of shirts for bulk, followed by a jacket that never came off, all in a goth style to create a distraction. There were beatings, and the teen developed a strategy: Keep a straight face. Don\u2019t scream. Don\u2019t say anything. The startled bully might just back off.Amie Schofield allowed her child to experiment with nail polish and dresses at home, but in the years after the fatal beating of gay man Matthew Shepard in nearby Wyoming, she was terrified to go public. She aches when she thinks about those years.\u201cI wish that we could have been open,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I had understood more so that maybe I could have made it easier.\u201dThe move to Utah put the teenager in touch with other LGBTQ people, and for the first time exploring femininity publicly seemed possible. Instead of a beating, wearing a dress might earn supportive shouts like \u201ckeep doing you!\u201dThat all changed one night in 2014. As they (the pronoun preferred by this person) walked to a Salt Lake City bar wearing a favorite tie-dye dress, a man shouted, \u201cWhere you going mama? You\u2019re looking pretty good in that dress!\u201dNever having been hit on before, they turned to say thank you. But the man\u2019s face changed when he heard a deep voice that didn\u2019t match that female body. He blew up, spewing gay slurs, and charged, weighted pipe in hand.He landed a number of powerful blows. Blood sprayed everywhere before he fled, leaving the young person for dead.A large gash to the head was treated with staples at a hospital. Police investigated, but couldn\u2019t catch the assailant, according to officials.When doctors said her child would be a girl, Amie Schofield chose the name Victoria. Then they said the child would be a boy, so she switched to Victor. It turned out neither was right. The baby was intersex, with both male and female traits. (June 10)\n___Amie was in the hospital after giving birth to Victory when she heard about the attack on her eldest child.  She felt angry, helpless \u2014 and determined to protect her baby. She didn\u2019t want her youngest child to live with the secrecy and fear that colored her first child\u2019s teenage years.\u201cI don\u2019t want her to live that kind of life,\u201d she said.Like her half-sibling, Victory has XXY chromosomes. She also has a separate condition that means her body doesn\u2019t fully respond to male hormones. Her genitalia are ambiguous, but due to the Y chromosome doctors marked the birth certificate as male, and encouraged Victory\u2019s parents to raise the baby as a boy.Amie and her husband took newborn Victory home. The family lives north of Salt Lake City on a plot of land ringed by mountains where they raise chickens, goats and pigs along with Victory and her two brothers.They decided to raise the baby without pushing either gender. There would be no surgery. At 18 months, Victory began gravitating toward dresses and bows, and loudly insisting on wearing her hair long. Their then-pediatrician Nisha Baur said Victory\u2019s parents took things as they came during her earliest years. \u201cThey were very open to just accepting whatever was going to happen,\u201d she said.Today, Victory is a vivacious 5-year-old with a toothy grin, blond hair and a quick mind. She\u2019s mostly deaf due to a separate genetic condition, but communicates clearly with signs, some words and sheer force of personality. She runs around the house at top speed, cradling a reluctant kitten, perching next to her great-grandmother to read a book or running for the bus in a sparkling silver backpack with butterfly wings.Victory knows her body is different from those of her mother, father or brothers, but it doesn\u2019t seem to bother her, Amie Schofield said.Her eldest child lives outside the state. They recovered physically from the attack, but for months afterward there was a constant sense of deep fear. They retreated into masculine clothing, affecting as deep a voice as possible, attempting to grow out what little facial hair they have.Knowing Victory was born intersex brought a sense of comradeship but also fear for her.  \u201cI\u2019m scared of how society will treat her,\u201d they said.Victory\u2019s parents share that apprehension. There are so many hazards ahead.Victory\u2019s father, Michael Schofield, formally left the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints shortly after she was born. The faith doesn\u2019t have an official position on intersex people, but is doctrinally opposed to same-sex marriage and intimacy.\u201cWill she marry a boy or a girl? Which one is right? Which one is wrong?\u201d said Schofield, a federal worker. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that ... she\u2019s free to make her own choices.\u201dHer parents would like to change the designation on her birth certificate from boy to girl, but Utah law requires a court order and some judges in their area won\u2019t approve the changes. Amie Schofield and Victory have gone to the capitol to speak out in favor of changing the law, so far unsuccessfully.The deaf school she attends has single-user, non-gendered restrooms, but what happens if she changes schools? What will dating be like one day? Will she have trouble as she applies for jobs, or apartments, or schools? Could she also be targeted by violence? How will she feel about not being able to have children?Her mother can only hope to teach her to handle these dilemmas herself. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I can save her from,\u201d Amie Schofield said.But whatever comes, the family isn\u2019t going to hide.\u201cI hate the secrecy,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s just so smart, so full of life. She\u2019s just a normal girl.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/muriel-bowser-archive-31c409baa8b7c5b45a3c340ed474a093", "headline": "D.C. Council considers new office to resolve sign-language woes ...", "date": "2018-12-11T16:45:17Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "The D.C. Council is considering creating a separate office for deaf and hard-of-hearing residents because disability advocates say the city fails to provide qualified American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters.Deaf city resident Brianne Burger is director/liaison of the Office of Special Institutions at the U.S. Department of Education. She began advocating for a new city office after the January 2016 blizzard.\u201cD.C. knew this blizzard was coming and prepared for it ahead of time. However, no one thought to hire ASL interpreters for [Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s] press conferences,\u201d said Ms. Burger. \u201cIt was an afterthought, and by the time they realized it, no one had a list or directory of interpreters.\u201dADVERTISEMENTThe D.C. area is known for having one of the highest concentrations of deaf and hard-of-hearing residents in the country, and the city is home to Gallaudet University, the federally chartered, liberal arts college for deaf and hard-of-hearing students.This month, council member Charles Allen, Ward 6 Democrat, introduced legislation with member David Grosso, at-large independent, to create a new bureau: The Office on Deaf and Hard of Hearing Establishment Amendment Act of 2018 would establish a new office to take over responsibility of ASL interpreters from the Office of Disability Rights.Ms. Burger originally proposed the idea for the John A. Wilson District Building in March 2016, citing the 35 other states that have an office of deaf and hard-of-hearing. The idea didn\u2019t gain traction until the 2018 elections.Robb Dooling and Matthew Sampson are both deaf D.C. residents who won Advisory Neighborhood Commission elections this month. Mr. Sampson said he and Mr. Dooling began supporting Ms. Burger\u2019s idea after they found they couldn\u2019t attend ANC meetings due to a lack of sign-language interpreters.The council earmarked $25,000 in the 2016 budget for ANC interpreters, but only $1,000 was ever spent due to difficulties allocating the funding, The Washington City Paper reported. This year, ANCs have $15,000 for interpreters but requesting one remains a messy process.Emails from Nov. 1 reviewed by The Washington Times indicate that the executive director of the Office of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions handles requests for the Office of Disability Rights because the council set up the funding to be processed by the Department on Disability Services, which does not provide interpreters for the public.\u201cNo one knew how to access that fund,\u201d said Mr. Sampson. \u201cSo it was clear to us that we needed an office to coordinate issues like these.\u201dADVERTISEMENTMr. Dooling, a native sign-language user, said he is \u201cexcited and hopeful\u201d the bill can help blacklist \u201clousy interpreters\u201d who he says are rehired despite showing up late for work or being unable to understand signing.Mathew McCollough, director of the Office of Disability Rights (ODR), said in a statement to The Times that the office is \u201ccommitted to the full implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act in the District and compliance with all other federal and local disability-related laws,\u201d and that residents are encouraged to contact the office to file a complaint.A spokeswoman for the office added that ODR has made \u201crevisions\u201d to its sign-language program, and that it fulfilled 486 requests for interpreters over the past fiscal year.Interpreter woes also have plagued the legislative process. Sean Maiwald, an adjunct professor at Gallaudet who is also deaf, helped write the bill this summer as a fellow in Mr. Grosso\u2019s office. He said the $60-per-hour cost for interpreters exceeded the council budget and forced him to sometimes go without one.\u201cIt was hard to have impromptu meetings or to just drop in I had to plan things out several weeks in advance which was difficult when the fellowship is only for the quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was also really hard to network or collaborate with people especially considering the hectic schedules.\u201dIt\u2019s a struggle that\u2019s familiar to Mr. Sampson, who said the current request deadlines has hurt his ability to be an effective commissioner.\u201cIf something slips by me, and I find out about it after the five-day limit to request an interpreter, then that effectively means I can\u2019t go,\u201d he said.The bill is expected to receive a hearing early next year, after which it will require two votes from the council, the mayor\u2019s signature and congressional approval to become law."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/united-states-wyoming-torrington-be93a574c7c54d6db11bfe082e3aa675", "headline": "EWC offering American Sign Language course | AP News", "date": "2018-03-25T16:00:36Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "TORRINGTON - The Community Education office at Eastern Wyoming College in Torrington is offering an Introduction to American Sign Language class.

Charles new dance work, To Hear Like Me. As the dancers bend, reach, leap and turn to songs by Algiers, Fantastic Negrito and Meshell Ndegeocello, their hands form some of the lyrics in American Sign Language (ASL).Charles, whose Minnesota-based Threads Dance Project will perform at the OShaughnessy next weekend, isnt the first choreographer to include ASL in her dances. But her reasons, methods and results are her own.This idea has been in my head since I taught deaf dancers 20 years ago, when I was a high school dance teacher, Charles said after a rehearsal in late October. Im always thinking how can I raise peoples awareness? How can I make people more empathetic and caring toward each other?ADVERTISEMENTCharles son has a deaf girlfriend. Over the last year, she said to me, Ive never seen your show. That made me think is there a way to really try to be more inclusive of someone who hears differently than I do?Charles founded Threads in 2011 to examine, expose and celebrate the threads that connect us. The name came from her grandmother, who used thread to join mismatched fabric scraps into colorful quilts. The push to start her company came from her father, a postal clerk who left her $10,000 when he died from colon cancer. Near the end of his life, he revealed that he had always longed to be a doctor. Charles didnt want to someday tell her children why she never followed her dream. She quit her day job.Her mission goes beyond just dancing to embrace weighty themes including race, death, slavery, injustice, societal violence and gender roles. She translates them into choreography of beauty and soulfulness. She believes that boosting awareness and building empathy through dance can make us better people and our world a better place.For To Hear Like Me, Charles wants deaf/hard of hearing people to experience a dance performance in all its fullness and artistry. She wants hearing people to think about the deaf/hard of hearing community and instead of just avoiding them, which is often what we do, be brave and get to know someone. Put yourself out there.Dancing with deaf heartsEarly on, Charles gathered a team to help her get it right. Guest artist Canae Weiss is a choreographer, dancer and actor who has been deaf since birth and dancing since she was 5 years old. She has trained and worked with Ballet Arts Minnesota, Ethnic Dance Theatre, James Sewell Ballet and others. Terryann Nash is an ASL interpreter and teacher. Rebecca Demmings, Nashs business partner, is a deaf artist and activist.ADVERTISEMENTAll are linked by a common thread: Patrick Scully, dancer and founder of Patricks Cabaret, which closed earlier this year.Charles was serving on a panel with Scully when he asked her what she was working on. I said I was looking for an interpreter and would love to have deaf dancers in the piece, Charles said. He said, Oh, I know some people.andthinsp;Weiss is a former student of Scullys. Ive grown up all my life with him as a mentor, she said, speaking through Nash. It was Scully who told Weiss about Nash, and Nash brought in Demmings as a specialist. Together, theyre helping Threads create what Nash calls deaf hearts.Let me give you a really good example of the value of me reaching out to these ladies, Charles said. When I had this idea, I could have just read. I did read. I did some research. I visited Gallaudet [the university for the deaf in Washington, D.C.], which was really eye-opening.Then I met with Canae. My thought was I want people to really experience what a deaf person experiences. I was trying to figure out how to have people plug their ears. Canae was like, No, no, no!andthinsp;Thats not the point, Weiss explained. There are different levels of hearing loss. Some people have a little bit. Some people have a cochlear implant or a hearing aid. You cant really know. The point was creating a visual experience, a visual explanation, all of it integrated in the art and involving the dancers.They can become dancersFor the Threads dancers, signing while dancing was a challenge. They had to learn new choreography and the basics of a new language, all at the same time. When Charles first described the project to the dancers, their responses went from really excited to really scared, she said. But as the process has gone on, I think they are proud of the fact that were sharing and raising awareness. Theyre really wanting to get it right.In rehearsal, when Demmings noticed a mistake in the signing, the dancers were intent, focused, willing to do it over.Charles wanted deaf dancer Weiss to feel a part of things. I know what it feels like to be the only person like me in the room.Weiss describes her experience as wonderful. Its exciting to be open-minded with open-minded people.Demmings hopes other deaf/hard of hearing people will see Canae dance with Threads. Im not a performer, she said, again through Nash, but I can feel how important it is to watch her as a deaf person, and I want other people to have that experience. To know they can become dancers and performers and connect.The performances will also include projections: visual representations of the music, some with lyrics, designed by composer and musician Peter Morrow. ASL interpreters will be present. So audience members who are deaf/hard of hearing can look at the visuals, the lyrics, the ASL interpreters and the signing being done by the dancers. Its all there, and its right there, and you can enjoy it because its all integrated into one, Weiss said.To Hear Like Me is the first part of an evening-length program called In the Margins. For the second half, Femthology, Charles drew from her companys repertoire of works about women, another group often marginalized. One of the dances is Mistresses Lament, from Charles 2014 piece Secrets of Slave Songs. Another is Sacred Feminism, inspired by words from poet and playwright Ntozake Shange, who died in October.The evening will end with Bootyful, a playful exploration of a female body part that often gets way too much attention. It started from a serious place, about how women are forced to be so self-conscious about their bodies, Charles said. But its a fun piece, and hilarious. We want people to leave feeling uplifted, especially in these times.This part of the program has also been made more accessible, with visualizations and ASL woven throughout.

And now he\u2019s writing his own TV show.ADVERTISEMENTAll that has made DiMarco one of the most recognizable celebrities \u2014 and activists \u2014 in the deaf community.DiMarco, who grew up in a deaf family and has been deaf since birth, will visit Madison on Tuesday as a guest of the Wisconsin Union Directorate\u2019s Distinguished Lecture Series, a student-run organization. DiMarco\u2019s free, 50-minute talk will begin at 7:30 p.m. in Union Theater, followed by a 30-minute Q&A.His primary theme, he explained in an email: \u201cTo embrace yourself first before anything. I love my identity as a Deaf person, and because of that I\u2019m able to succeed in anything.\u201dDiMarco also will spend part of Tuesday afternoon at UW-Madison with deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The McBurney Disability Resource Center, which works to ensure the university campus is inclusive and accommodating for students with disabilities, is partnering with the Distinguished Lecture Series on the invitation-only event. Students from UW-Madison, UW-Whitewater, University of Minnesota, Wisconsin School for the Deaf and other schools are expected to attend.The visit will give those students not only a chance to meet the dynamic DiMarco, but also to network with each other, said Mari Magler, assistant dean and director of the McBurney Disability Resource Center.\u201cOur campus has less than 50 deaf or hard-of-hearing students, and they have almost no exposure to deaf professionals (or) speakers here,\u201d she said.\u201cCultural Deafness is an aspect of diversity that is not often represented on campus. American Sign Language is offered as a world language at many colleges and universities around the country. UW-Madison does not currently offer ASL classes, but I\u2019d love to see it offered here to promote awareness of deafness and ASL as an aspect of cultural diversity,\u201d Magler said.ADVERTISEMENTDiMarco credits his deafness for his \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d win \u2013 because speaking American Sign Language requires facial and body expression, and so does modeling, he says.In \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d he learned his dances without benefit of music or vibrations, and wowed the audience at one point by dancing in silence \u2013 to mimic the world of the non-hearing.He used his celebrity to found the Nyle DiMarco Foundation, whose main goal \u201cis language access for all deaf kids between 0-5,\u201d DiMarco explained.\u201cWe are working with another Deaf organization to ensure that every Deaf child has access to language from day one of their birth, ASL and/or English.\u201dDiMarco grew up with deaf parents, and 25 of his relatives are deaf. From DiMarco\u2019s own \u201cday one,\u201d his parents knew how to raise him, he says \u2013 speaking to him in ASL through infancy, then sending him to schools for the deaf. DiMarco earned a bachelor\u2019s in mathematics from the bilingual (ASL/English) Gallaudet University, and intended to become a math teacher until fame intervened.\u201cI think a lot of people are excited about this,\u201d said Ziyad Sultan, director of the Wisconsin Union Directorate\u2019s Distinguished Lecture Series and a UW-Madison senior in neurobiology.\u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve ever had a deaf speaker\u201d in the series, Sultan said. \u201cSecond of all, the work that he\u2019s doing to bring awareness about the deaf community is really important. Just seeing all that he stood for, it was very easy for us to vote for him.\u201dThe Distinguished Lecture Series, run by UW-Madison undergraduates, takes nominations for speakers to bring on campus, and tends to pick speakers \u201cwho are covering content areas that we really haven\u2019t covered before, or whose ideas we think are particularly powerful,\u201d Sultan explained.Ranging from academics and activists to up-and-coming stars, DLS speakers can draw crowds ranging from 150 people to packed houses at the 1,175-seat Union Theater, he said. Admission is free.The visits are paid for with student fees, often with help from other campus organizations or departments with an interest in co-sponsoring a particular speaker.Other upcoming speakers this year include Lena Waithe, creator and executive producer of Showtime\u2019s \u201cThe Chi\u201d and the first African-American woman to win an Emmy Award for Best Writing in a Comedy Series for her work on the Netflix series \u201cMaster of None\u201d (appearing Feb. 13 at Union South); Wisconsin native Jeremy Scahill, investigative reporter and author of \u201cBlackwater\u201d and \u201cDirty Wars: The World is a Battlefield\u201d (March 6 in Union Theater); biologist, author and cancer survivor Sandra Steingraber (April 9, 800 University Ave.); and another possible speaker in April.The hearing community will have a special opportunity at DiMarco\u2019s talk, said Magler of the campus disability resource center. Ninety percent of deaf individuals have hearing parents, she said, and DiMarco\u2019s message about the critical role of early-childhood language development for all children \u2014 be it ASL or any other language \u2014 is crucial.The tech-savvy DiMarco was a creative collaborator on the ASL App, designed to teach conversational ASL. He also teaches ASL lessons on his charismatic YouTube channel, flaunts his photogenic side on Instagram, and recently congratulated Hollywood on Twitter for nominating several films with deaf actors for this year\u2019s Oscars.Although the Distinguished Lecture Series always has a sign-language interpreter for the non-hearing audience, the tables will turn with DiMarco\u2019s talk \u2013 when the speaker will talk in ASL, and the hearing audience will have to rely on an interpreter to relay his remarks, Sultan said.\u201cIt\u2019s been a fascinating experience\u201d planning DiMarco\u2019s appearance, he said. \u201cBecause usually the hearing folks, we don\u2019t have to worry about hearing the speaker at all.\u201d When non-ASL speakers want to ask DiMarco a question, they can turn to an interpreter standing by."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/accidents-archive-7364c440fabc4b308ba83b4ab523394c", "headline": "Caleb J.

What better way to interpret a skit in which Kim Kardashian dances on hubby Kanye West?Sure, Longbrake could\u2019ve simply stood still with her head down, as translators typically do during non-verbal moments. But where\u2019s the fun in that?During the performance of \u201cHoliday Hoopla\u201d \u2014 a signature show by the performance troupe in its Brewery District theater \u2014 Longbrake and five other student interpreters instead added a little flair to their translating duties.The hope was that this would help any patrons with hearing impairments in the audience pick up on every nuance, emotion and joke just by watching the interpreters. No need to constantly pingpong back and forth between interpreter and actor, said Stacie Boord, the theater\u2019s executive director.ADVERTISEMENTThe performance was part of the final exam for the students, all of whom were part of a Columbus State Community College class focused on teaching sign language interpretation for live theater performance. Boord said she believes it\u2019s the only such partnership in the country between a theater and college. (The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders does not track this, an official said.)\u201cSome of these kids are so good, they\u2019re so fun,\u201d Boord said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an added bonus to the ticket price to come and see this.\u201dBoord thinks something is lost when interpreters stick to standard signing, translating words in a static manner. After all, she said, if patrons with hearing impairments are to enjoy the show as much as anyone else, then shouldn\u2019t the interpreters be just as dynamic as the performers?So when a deaf patron shared those concerns with Boord in 2015, she decided to approach the Interpreter Education Program at Columbus State Community College with a proposal for the class. Though artistic interpreting had been covered in a special topics course, no class in the school\u2019s curriculum had been devoted entirely to the topic, according to program coordinator Royce Carpenter.Debuting that fall, the course remains a popular elective for students in their second year of the interpreting program, Carpenter said. Students in the class \u2014 which is co-taught by Carpenter and adjunct professor Marlena Smith \u2014 spend the semester preparing for three performances in Shadowbox\u2019s \u201cHoliday Hoopla\u201d show.At the outset, students work from old Shadowbox scripts to learn how best to inhabit the show\u2019s characters and give them life while interpreting their words.ADVERTISEMENTWhat mannerisms or affectations should they exude? What posture or facial expressions are most suited for any given character? What other hands movements or gestures outside of official sign language could be appropriate?Someone interpreting an actor playing a frail grand-mother, for instance, may hunch her back. Or if a characters is reading a book, the interpreter may hold his hands up, palms facing in, to simulate the action.\u201cThey have to become the character,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cWe want to make sure they (deaf patrons) see the show through our students.\u201dWhen the class receives the script for that year\u2019s holiday show, the students begin to meet at the theater to work with Boord and Shadowbox actors. Many of the students have no background in theater, so they learn stage etiquette and theater terminology.\u201cYou can\u2019t be shy,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe actors aren\u2019t holding back; they\u2019re giving everything they have, so we have to do the same thing.\u201dStudents in the second year of the two-year program already have a firm grasp on sign language itself, so the Shadowbox class offers a chance to step outside their comfort zones. Some students in this year\u2019s class said they relish that opportunity.\u201cIt\u2019s been great to watch my classmates grow,\u201d Longbrake, 22, said. \u201cWe\u2019re told not to draw attention to ourselves as interpreters, and now the opposite is true.\u201dAbigail Ahearn, 23, took the class last year and decided to take part again \u2014 though not for credit this time \u2014 because of how meaningful the experience was to her. She said she understands the nerves that come with being in front of an audience, so she helped encourage her stage-shy classmates.\u201cPeople are definitely intimidated because of the acting portion, but, once you get on stage, it\u2019s easy,\u201d said Ahearn, a Westerville resident.About 30 people had requested seating in the ASL section for the Friday 10:30 p.m. performance, Boord said.Before curtains, the students \u2014 wearing black shirts with quarter-length sleeves \u2014 mingled in the lounge and provided interpretive services to any hearing-impaired patrons who arrived. Their jobs included pointing out restrooms and exits, showing guests to their seats and translating for the waiters.When the show began, up to three interpreters shared the stage at a time, animatedly translating for the actors. They mimicked every smile, every scowl and every jolly belly laugh elicited by Santa Claus.At a musical performance of Dropkick Murphy\u2019s \u201cThe Season\u2019s Upon Us\u201d \u2014 set in a raucous Irish bar \u2014 Ahearn and Andrew Drobnick went so far as to simulate the dancing and fistfights taking place stage right.Several of the students who have taken the class have gone on to do artistic interpreting. Some of them even returned to Shadowbox, which tries to offer translation services when requested by patrons, Boord said.\u201cTo be able to teach interpreters how to perform better in an artistic setting and to serve an audience that might not be able to enjoy it to the level they should,\u201d Boord said, \u201cit\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/archive-421737cb462d4e4a98f35076ab077da1", "headline": "Iowa School for the Deaf | AP News", "date": "2018-05-13T10:38:38Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "Erica BloomhallKey StafferJournalistic roles: yearbook editor; graduation video and program designer and editorCollege plans: Gallaudet UniversityParents: Anne and Duane Jasper, Billy BloomhallAbout: Erica possesses an unfailing dedication to any project she is given.

At her home preserve, where she was treated like a queen, she ran around with Williams\u2019 eyeglasses and unzipped Rogers\u2019 famous cardigan sweater.ADVERTISEMENTIn so doing, Koko showed the American public that a giant ape didn\u2019t have to be scary but wanted to be tickled and hugged.The Gorilla Foundation said the 280-pound (127-kilogram) western lowland gorilla died in her sleep at the foundation\u2019s preserve in California\u2019s Santa Cruz mountains Tuesday.Koko was the not the first animal to learn sign language and communicate, but through books and media appearances she became the most famous. Yet there was debate in the scientific community about how deep and human-like her conversations were.Koko appeared in many documentaries, including a 2015 PBS one, and twice in National Geographic. The gorilla\u2019s 1978 National Geographic cover featured a photo that the animal had taken of herself in a mirror.\u201cKoko the individual was supersmart, like all the apes, and also sensitive, something not everyone expected from a \u2018king kong\u2019 type animal that movies depict as dangerous and formidable,\u201d Emory University primate researcher Frans de Waal said in an email Thursday.\u201cIt changed the image of apes, and gorillas in particular, for the better, such as through the children\u2019s book \u2018Koko\u2019s Kitten\u2019 that may young people have grown up with. To view apes as nice and caring was new to the public and a big improvement.\u201dKoko watched movies and television, with her handlers saying her favorite book was \u201cThe Three Little Kittens,\u201d her favorite movies included the Eddie Murphy version of \u201cDoctor Doolittle\u201d and \u201cFree Willy,\u201d and her favorite TV show was \u201cWild Kingdom.\u201dFor her 25th birthday, she asked for and received a box of rubber snakes. In 1996, she even asked to be a mother. Despite attempts by her keepers to introduce male partners, Koko never became a mother. Instead, she had a series of kittens as pets.The first was named All Ball, a gray and white tail-less kitten, given to Koko for her birthday in 1984. Other cats followed after All Ball\u2019s death, but researchers reported that the gorilla kept \u201cmourning\u201d the original cat years later.Koko\u2019s real name was Hanabi-Ko, Japanese for fireworks child. She was born July 4, 1971, at the San Francisco Zoo.Francine Patterson was working on her doctoral dissertation on the linguistic capabilities of gorillas and in 1972 started to teach Koko sign language. Patterson and biologist Ronald Cohn moved Koko to their newly established preserve in 1974 and kept teaching and studying her, adding a male gorilla in 1979.In 2004, Koko used American Sign Language to communicate that her mouth hurt and used a pain scale of 1 to 10 to show how badly it hurt.\u201cKoko represents what language may have been 5 million years ago for people,\u201d Cohn said in 1996. \u201cThat\u2019s the time that gorillas and humans separated in evolution.\u201dOther scientists, such as Herbert Terrace at Columbia University, who raised and taught sign language to a primate named Nim Chimpksy (a play on the name of the linguist Noam Chomsky), argued in scientific and popular literature that most of Koko\u2019s conversations and those of other primates were \u201cnot spontaneous but solicited by questions from her teachers and companions.\u201d\u201cScientists have often complained about possible overinterpretation of Koko\u2019s sign language utterances and the lack of proper documentation of what she has said when and how,\u201d deWaal said in an email, adding that \u201ccoaching and interpretation by the people around her\u201d may have altered her messages at times.But the science, deWaal said, was \u201cirrelevant to Koko\u2019s pop-image. ... Koko\u2019s passing is the end of an era, and a genuine loss.\u201dKoko frequently asked to see people\u2019s nipples, a habit that led to controversy more than a dozen years ago, when two former caretakers said they were fired for refusing to bare their breasts to the gorilla. The women settled with the foundation in 2005.Video shows Koko grabbing for Williams\u2019 chest area and Shatner\u2019s groin.Williams, another San Francisco Bay area legend, met Koko in 2001 and called it a \u201cmind-altering experience.\u201d The two held hands and tickled each other in a widely shared video.\u201cWe shared something extraordinary: Laughter,\u201d he said. He called it \u201cawesome and unforgettable.\u201d Williams killed himself in 2014.Patterson later said she didn\u2019t plan on telling Koko about Williams\u2019 death, but the gorilla overheard conversation and then later \u201cmourned\u201d the actor by going silent and sullen.Koko knew about death, primary researcher Patterson said in 2015, relaying in The Atlantic a conversation Koko had with another caretaker:\u201cThe caregiver showed Koko a skeleton and asked, \u2018Is this alive or dead?\u2019 Koko signed, \u2018Dead, draped.\u2019 \u2018Draped\u2019 means \u2018covered up.\u2019 Then the caregiver asked, \u2018Where do animals go when they die?\u2019 Koko said, \u2018A comfortable hole.\u2019 Then she gave a kiss goodbye.\u201d___Borenstein reported from Washington."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/44b8a0903b564e309cbe5c07d9d15075", "headline": "Developer Postpones Marywood South Proposal Going Before ...", "date": "2018-11-14T21:44:15Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "SCRANTON \u2014 A developer withdrew his plan to convert the former Scranton State School for the Deaf into an artists\u2019 apartment complex called Marywood South, but intends to submit a new proposal to the city and Dunmore before the end of the year.Los Angeles-based Urban Smart Growth\u2019s application for a variance for the one building at the deaf school campus within Scranton\u2019s border was on the city Zoning Board\u2019s agenda for its meeting tonight at 6 p.m.But the firm pulled the application today based upon concerns of some neighbors, company founder Lance Robbins said this afternoon in a phone interview.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cWe\u2019re not abandoning the project,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reset.\u201dUrban Smart Growth plans to buy from Marywood University the 10-acre site and its nine buildings in Green Ridge. Most of the property and eight buildings are in Dunmore; one structure, at 1800 N. Washington Ave., is in Scranton.A Robbins-related firm, Brick Investment Corp., sought a variance from Scranton to use the 33,940-square-foot \u201cBuilding 1\u201d at 1800 N. Washington Ave. as a bar, restaurant and 36 units of live/art studios.Robbins calls Building 1 the linchpin of the project that, if rejected by Scranton, will force him to walk away from the entire plan. But some Scranton residents raised concerns about potential adverse impacts from the project. On Oct. 10, the zoning board tabled the variance to give both sides time to talk. They had since met but came away without any agreement.Robbins said his firm did not anticipate concerns about what he termed \u201ccollateral issues,\u201d and it would be easier to start new than to try to do amendments to fill in blanks to address concerns.\u201cEverybody seems a lot more interested in the broader plan,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cWe said all right, lets go back and think it through.\u201dMeanwhile, the Dunmore Zoning Board scheduled its own hearing \u2014 on Nov. 29 at 7 p.m. at the Dunmore Community Center on Monroe Avenue \u2014 on a variance sought by Brick Investment Corp. to convert five buildings at the deaf school campus into apartments and another one into a bed-and-breakfast.The firm told Dunmore that uses of the remaining two buildings in Dunmore are undetermined but may include a wellness center, live/work units and a restaurant.But the application in Dunmore also likely will be withdrawn and resubmitted, in which the firm would postpone the Dunmore variance until the Scranton variance is completed, Robbins said.Contact the writer: jlockwood@timesshamrock.com; 570-348-9100 x5185; @jlockwoodTT on Twitter"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/37b783c3831489753400cc5ba70ce47c", "headline": "Saturday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2018-10-14T01:21:08Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "PREP FOOTBALL=Mississippi School for the Deaf 50, Oklahoma School for the Deaf, Okla. 8___Some high school football scores provided by Scorestream.com, https://scorestream.com/"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/john-krasinski-emily-blunt-ae6934e07a90472fb8e03f2bf7095ea3", "headline": "Silence is the star of 'A Quiet Place' | AP News", "date": "2018-04-06T17:20:54Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "John Krasinski, known most readily for his role in \u201cThe Office,\u201d not only stars in the new horror/thriller \u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d but he also wrote and directed it.

And it won\u2019t be the last based on the predicted success of this film.Lee (Krasinski), Evelyn (Blunt) and their three children live in a world of silence in a post-apocalyptic small town. There is no other sign of life as they walk through an abandoned grocery store, shelves wiped clean except for the well-stocked chip shelves (that\u2019s a clue), no cars on the street and long-forgotten surroundings. It\u2019s fall, and dressed in sweaters, the family walks barefoot back to their home in absolute silence, only to have the sweet family of five quickly become a family of four thanks to a forbidden battery-operated toy.ADVERTISEMENTCommunicating through sign language and mourning the death of their youngest, the family attempts to live day by day in as normal a way as possible ... in silence. Playing board games with dice rolled on a rug, using lettuce leaves as plates, walking on paths made of sand or ash are all a part of how to live quietly. But when Evelyn becomes pregnant and gives birth, the family must outsmart the blind, but super-sensitive, auditory monsters hunting them. Coincidentally, the oldest daughter is hearing-impaired, frustrated by a nonfunctioning cochlear implant. (The actress herself is deaf.)There\u2019s no underscore of music, leaving the viewer uneasy. The ear-piercing screech of the monster/alien is equally jarring, juxtaposing the silence.In \u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d Krasinski demonstrates he can make us care and our hearts race. The story is a rather predictable horror/monster/alien invasion film, but what makes this one different is the extraordinary responsibility and love these parents have for their children. Creating this scenario, complete with a rebellious young teen and a boy who still needs to be coddled, isn\u2019t an easy task, but Krasinski hits all the right notes. While there are plenty of \u201cgotcha\u201d setups and a few holes in the premise, Krasinski gives us a story where we must find out how it ends.Blunt and Krasinski, not surprisingly, give exceptional performances as a husband and wife trying to survive. Noah Jupe (\u201cWonder\u201d) and Millicent Simmonds (\u201cWonderstruck\u201d) portray the couple\u2019s children with utmost ease.But it\u2019s the character of silence that\u2019s the star of this film.

Ahead of her appearance, she talked about her remarkable 2017, adapting to a new normal as a musician, what she misses hearing - and what she doesn\u2019t. She spoke by phone from Tampa, Fla., reading then answering questions orally via closed captioning.Q: What kind of reaction have you gotten from people, particularly those with disabilities, since you appeared on \u201cAGT\u201d?A: It\u2019s very interesting that a lot of people tell me I\u2019m the only person who does this. I am surrounded by brilliant deaf musicians all the time. So it\u2019s kind of beautiful to be helping to further the idea that \u201cdeaf can\u201d and to shed a little bit of a light on how there\u2019s different types of disabilities.There are invisible disabilities. I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 3. My whole body dislocates all the time, and it causes extreme pain. I have fragile nerves and joints, and sometimes I have trouble walking. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing more and more people who have stuff like EDS, and they\u2019ll show up in their wheelchair, and this\u2019ll be the first time that they\u2019ve left their house in a very long time. We just kind of hold onto each other and cry for a minute because the struggle that you deal with on a day-to-day basis, people just don\u2019t see it, and they don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s nice to be able to show that I\u2019m very much OK with my scars, and your scars are beautiful, too.Q: What are visual tuners, and how do they help you?ADVERTISEMENTA: I use one called Pano Tuner. It\u2019s a free app. You can sing into it, and you can see what notes you\u2019re singing. You plug them into software programs so you can see how your tone is shaped. There\u2019s a lot of technology out there that never used to be. I work a lot with dynamics of how loud I\u2019m talking, like speaking into balloons and then feeling the texture on my fingertips, and then I get used to the feeling on my throat. I\u2019ll have other people talk into the balloon so I can feel them be so much louder or so much softer than me and adjust accordingly.I play music using vibrating speakers. \u2026 When somebody sits with you and breaks down this thing that you\u2019re feeling over here, that\u2019s the bass, versus this thing that you\u2019re feeling here, this rhythm pattern, that\u2019s the drums, and this sporadic thing over here, that\u2019s the singer. You can kind of paint a picture and then play it while looking at it to see what notes they\u2019re singing or what key it\u2019s being played (in).Q: You write at the beginning of your book about the heartbreak of not remembering your father\u2019s voice. What sound do you miss hearing most?A: I do miss his voice. I miss the common things, the things that used to really annoy me, like an alarm clock. The sound of your zipper as your fly is being pulled up so that you know it actually is up. The sound of the door as it closes, to know that it\u2019s really shut. My feeling of security really went down the tubes when I couldn\u2019t hear anymore. When it got dark, I\u2019d get very afraid because I can\u2019t hear people coming up behind me. It took me a very long time to be able to sleep with the silence. \u2026 But I don\u2019t allow myself to dwell on what I\u2019m missing and instead focus on what I\u2019ve gained, which is I\u2019m a better person, I love people more, and I appreciate music more.Q: On the flip side, what don\u2019t you miss hearing?A: (Laughs.) Oh, my gosh! If I want to take a nap on a plane where there\u2019s a screaming baby sitting right next to me, I can just close my eyes, and they\u2019re gone. How many people would pay good money to have that temporary fix? I used to joke with my mom that I wanted to ignore her so well that I lost my hearing. That\u2019s just a joke! I love my mom. But I can meditate on the busiest subway station. There are some significant beauties to it.Q: You told the BBC you received death threats from within the deaf community for reading lips and speaking orally. What did you think about that?A: It\u2019s a small percentage of people, and I feel like the BBC interview really blew it out of proportion. \u2026 The deaf community has been pushed down for such a long time. We haven\u2019t even recognized American Sign Language as a true language for very long. We used to institutionalize people. There\u2019s a lot of pain in the history of having deafness as part of your life. For me, I just see it as, this person has pain that they\u2019re dealing with. But it has not deterred me. \u2026 You can allow those voices to be big or just not give them the power they\u2019re wanting. Why give them a voice?Q: What\u2019s next?A: We need to work on creating a more inclusive music experience. I\u2019m really so frustrated with going to festivals and there not being any closed captioning or interpreters. Why not allow the vast majority of people to understand what\u2019s being said? And not just ASL or English. I\u2019m making a point this year to learn to sing a couple of songs in different languages and then sign them in their appropriate language as well. I want to sing a song in French and then sign using French Sign Language. We\u2019re going to break down some barriers this year. That\u2019s my goal."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/0d854be910f44b5085c4b3b65422ce8c", "headline": "Cops: Big rig driver tears up neighborhood, assaults man | AP News", "date": "2018-11-02T16:49:03Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "CRESCENT, Pa.

(AP) \u2014 Mississippi\u2019s state Board of Education on Thursday approved A-to-F school ratings for a school district, plus four schools that teach special populations, despite complaints that the rating system treats them unfairly.Officials told the board Thursday that under their interpretation of state and federal laws, the state must rate those schools using the same tests and standards as other schools. The board had delayed action on those schools in October when it approved grades for others.ADVERTISEMENTCorinth got a C overall and its high school was rated F. However, other measures, such as ACT scores and graduation rates, suggest the district performs like higher-rated districts.\u201cWe do not believe it is an accurate reflection of the achievement and growth of our schools,\u201d said Superintendent Lee Childress. His district focuses on preparing students for the international Cambridge exams and not Mississippi\u2019s state tests.The state also gave failing marks to the Mississippi School for the Blind, Mississippi School for the Deaf, and schools in the Harrison County and Pascagoula-Gautier districts that serve only special education students.None of those special schools had ever been rated before, and the state had once agreed to develop an alternative rating system for Corinth, which uses a special curriculum and tests. However, state Chief Accountability Officer Paula Vanderford said the state determined in April that it would be illegal for the state to continue with either policy.\u201cThere are no exclusions in state or federal law for assigning grades to schools that have special populations,\u201d she said.State school board member Johnny Franklin of Bolton, the only board member who voted against the decision, said it\u2019s punitive both to schools that seek to be innovative and that are already challenged with students who are blind, deaf or have severe disabilities.\u201cThey\u2019ve got enough challenges as it is without us going and handing another thing around their neck, and that\u2019s an F,\u201d Franklin said.Childress disputes the state\u2019s legal interpretation. He notes that the waiver granted to Corinth to allow it to adopt a different curriculum, a modified year-round schedule and other changes is the same law the state cited in refusing to develop an alternative assessment. And in some other states under the current Every Student Succeeds Act, individual school districts are choosing among different types of tests.ADVERTISEMENTCorinth has earlier gone to court to try to block the grade, but Childress said it was likely the local school board would choose to appeal to the state Commission on School Accreditation. Turning first to such administrative remedies could give Corinth better grounds in a later court appeal.Childress said he hoped the district and state could resume work on getting the Cambridge exams approved, but said the district is taking measures to better prepare students for state tests. He said the low grades won\u2019t undermine Cornith\u2019s efforts to \u201cdo school differently.\u201d\u201cWe do not think it will undermine it in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cOur commitment to Cambridge remains strong.\u201d___Follow Jeff Amy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffamy ."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/a96ed3d3c7a34e2fbc535663dc1beb30", "headline": "Texas ed board votes to restore lessons on Clinton, Keller | AP News", "date": "2018-11-14T01:38:11Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 The Texas Board of Education preliminarily voted Tuesday night to restore Hillary Clinton and Helen Keller to the state\u2019s history curriculum and to slightly soften language about the Arab-Israeli conflict \u2014 surprising moments of bipartisanship for members who have long waged ideological battles about how students in the nation\u2019s second largest state learn history.The moves came after the board\u2019s 10 Republicans and five Democrats heard hours of often impassioned testimony from students, teachers, activists and university experts on proposed edits meant to streamline academic standards for history. A final vote is scheduled for Friday and more changes can still be made.ADVERTISEMENTIn September, the board voted to cut lessons on former secretary of state, senator and 2016 presidential candidate Clinton, as well as Keller, an iconic activist who was deaf and blind.Emotions often ran high Tuesday, particularly when Gabrielle Caldwell, a 17-year-old hearing- and visually-impaired student, spoke about how Keller was the only connection many people have to the deaf and blind community.\u201cI am hoping you keep Helen Keller being taught in our schools,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cShe\u2019s a hero.\u201dThe board voted hours after Caldwell\u2019s testimony to restore Keller to third grade curriculums with minimal debate. It also restored a previously trimmed second grade lesson about Women Airforce Service Pilots, civilians who flew during World War II and were the first U.S. women to pilot military aircraft.The proposal to again include Clinton sparked more debate but eventually passed easily. Democrats said Texas girls will be inspired by \u2014 and should be taught about \u2014 the first female presidential candidate to earn a major party nomination, while Republicans said they\u2019d heard from other residents demanding to know why Clinton was cut in the first place.\u201cI think she qualifies as a significant political leader,\u201d said Marty Rowley, a Republican from Amarillo, while noting that he didn\u2019t agree with Clinton\u2019s politics.Texas has around 5.4 million public school students, more than any state but California. Teaching board-approved lessons isn\u2019t always mandatory, but its sanctioned curriculum can affect what\u2019s published in textbooks.The state\u2019s market is large enough that its curriculum sometimes influences what goes into materials used elsewhere around the country \u2014 though that\u2019s less true in recent years as technology allows for tailoring what\u2019s taught to different states and even individual school districts.ADVERTISEMENTOther hot-button curriculum topics went unchanged despite long-standing objections from university professors and other experts. The board refused to modify controversial lessons on the causes of the Civil War and asking students to explore the biblical figure Moses\u2019 influence on the nation\u2019s Founding Fathers.Political lessons referencing Moses have been in Texas curriculums since 2010. A panel of experts had proposed cutting those, but the board voted in September to preserve them. It also retained language that students learn how \u201cArab rejection of the State of Israel has led to ongoing conflict\u201d in the Middle East.On Tuesday, the board voted to make rejection of many Arabs of the State of Israel a contributing factor to Middle East conflict. But it didn\u2019t change references to Moses, or instruction on how sectionalism and states\u2019 rights were \u201ccontributing factors\u201d to the Civil War, while also noting in the curriculum that slavery was a \u201ccentral cause.\u201d\u201cThere are people who believe that some of the events that happened long before this became a boiling point for war was the fact that they did not want to be told what to do by the central government,\u201d Pat Hardy, a Republican from Fort Worth, said of the Civil War, adding that southern states were \u201cvery, very independent\u201d and didn\u2019t like Washington telling them what to do.Ruben Cortez, a Democrat from the Texas-Mexico border city of Brownsville, responded: \u201cI think we just need to do the right thing, and I think I better stop talking before I get upset.\u201dMarisa Perez-Diaz, a Democrat from suburban San Antonio, said the curriculum wording was meant to skirt \u201cthe real issue, which is slavery.\u201dNo changes were made despite nearly 200 historians and scholars signing a petition circulated by the Texas Freedom Network, a watchdog group and frequent board critic, which said such standards \u201cresurrect the \u2018Lost Cause\u2019 myth, a long-discredited version of history first promoted in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to glorify the Confederate past and reinforce white supremacist policies.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/aeb6d820463087e30ed363d90c8e6d9c", "headline": "Friday's Scores | AP News", "date": "2018-12-01T05:01:48Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "GIRLS PREP BASKETBALL=Archbold 54, Wauseon 35Bloomdale Elmwood 37, Genoa Area 24Cardington-Lincoln 66, Howard E.

Doug Ducey announces deal for 280 new school buses | AP ...", "date": "2018-06-09T04:56:18Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "PHOENIX \u2014 More than 280 aging - and presumably high-polluting - school buses are going to be replaced, at no cost to Arizona taxpayers.Gov. Doug Ducey will announce today he intends to use more than half of the $59 million the state is getting as its share of a nationwide settlement with Volkswagen to replace buses that are at least 15 years old and have more than 100,000 miles on them.The available dollars for the buses are going largely to school districts where at least 60 percent of students come from families whose income qualifies them for free or reduced price lunches. The Arizona School for the Deaf and the Blind also will get some new buses.ADVERTISEMENTBut Ducey said this allocation formula effectively takes into account more than poverty. He said more than 80 percent of the buses will end up in counties which already are at risk of violating federal air quality standards.That\u2019s why school districts in Maricopa County will end up with 85 of the buses, with 60 for Pima County districts and 30 for Pinal.The price tag for the buses is an estimated $38 million.Ducey plans to use the balance of the funds for new large diesel vehicles.One will be a crew carrier for a newly created Post-Release Fire Crew, made up of mostly of people released from prison who either spent some time on prisoner fire crews while incarcerated or had previous firefighting experience.And the state will be buying some other heavy equipment, including snow plows, highway sweepers and paint-striper trucks.What\u2019s getting the state all this cash is a decision by Volkswagen in 2016 to settle a nationwide lawsuit over the sale of so-called \u201cclean diesel\u201d vehicles being marketed under the VW, Audi and Porsche labels that were anything but. It turns out they had a \u201cdefeat device,\u2019\u2019 programmed to go into a low-emission mode during testing but then spew out pollutants at much higher -- and illegal -- levels when actually on the road.VW eventually pleaded guilty to three felonies, including defrauding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and agreed to $4.3 billion in penalties and another $4.9 billion to address pollution from the supposedly low-emission diesel vehicles.Arizona\u2019s share of that is $59 million.But this isn\u2019t unrestricted cash. It had to be spent on project to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen, the very pollutants that the VW vehicles were spitting out above permissible levels.The plan being announced today still must be approved by the trustee set up by the federal court. That\u2019s because the terms of the nationwide settlement with the EPA specifically require that the dollars go toward projects designed to reduce air pollution.ADVERTISEMENTFilings by the state are designed to show that Ducey\u2019s plan meets that mandate.For example, it says that for each school bus replaced, emissions of nitrogen oxides will be reduced by nearly 1.4 tons over that vehicle\u2019s anticipated 12-year life.The governor\u2019s office also said it was a conscious decision not to try to replace the aging diesel-powered buses with electric vehicles.That starts with the fact that fewer than 50 electric school buses could be purchased for the same price as more than 150 conventionally fueled buses. And, by extension, replacing that many diesel-powered buses with new ones results in about 36 percent less pollution than buying fewer zero-emission buses.Don\u2019t look for those old buses to end up being sold off or even given away: The settlement requires that the vehicles being replaced be made inoperable through a hole in the engine block and a cut in the frame.There were others who had different ideas of how to spend the cash.For example, Airlines for America, a group that lobbies for the airline industry, asked that the dollars be used to convert ground equipment at airports to all-electric vehicles.Southwest Gas proposed converting vehicles to use natural gas.And both the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and General Motors suggested having the state erect a network of electric vehicle charging stations, a move that would promote the sale of more electric vehicles, most of which can\u2019t go on long trips because of limitations on battery charges.But gubernatorial policy advisor aide Daniel Ruiz said his boss wanted to use as much of the money possible to assist K-12 education.\u201cThere are aging school buses in our school districts that need to be replaced,\u201d he said.Arizona\u2019s share of the national settlement is on top of $40 million VW is paying to charges that it defrauded Arizona residents by selling them vehicles billed as clean-burning diesel,That deal reached by Attorney General Mark Brnovich provides payments up to $1,000 to each of about 10,000 Arizonans who bought or leased vehicles manufactured by VW, Audi and Porsche between 2008 to 2015. The money they get will be in addition to anything they have received or will receive from a nationwide lawsuit.Another $20 million went into the state general fund, with the dollars put into the pool of funds used to increase aid to public education."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/archive-8a9c73cf3c1b47fb8373c853396c5835", "headline": "BPS summer program offers variety of experiences", "date": "2018-07-02T08:03:15Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "The Best Possible Summer program with Beatrice Public Schools concluded Thursday afternoon.

I wanted to give students, especially those that may not have the opportunity to attend camps because of cost, the experience of learning about a sport. Students learned about track and field, basketball, soccer and football.\u201cIn addition, thanks to the generosity of the Devon and Jessica (Deines) Wegner family, two groups of students visited the Lincoln Children\u2019s Zoo. We made every effort to keep the hands-on approach to learning which, I believe, has made the Best Possible Summer program so successful.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/stan-mikita-illinois-il-state-wire-hockey-chicago-2c8947ad602d47d397b82d9490cf1261", "headline": "Blackhawks announce plans for public visitation for Mikita", "date": "2018-08-08T23:02:41Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "\n              FILE - In this Jan. 6, 1979, file photo, Chicago Blackhawks' Stan Mikita serves a penalty outside an already-full penalty box during an NHL game against the Toronto Maple Leafs in Toronto.

She awarded punitive damages and payments covering medical expenses, economic loss and pain and suffering to Fred and Cindy Warmbier, who alleged that their son had been held hostage and tortured.ADVERTISEMENTWarmbier was a University of Virginia student who was visiting North Korea with a tour group when he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in March 2016 on suspicion of stealing a propaganda poster. He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the U.S. in a coma and showing apparent signs of torture while in custody.In holding North Korean responsible, Howell said the government had seized Warmbier for \u201cuse as a pawn in that totalitarian state\u2019s global shenanigans and face-off with the United States.\u201d\u201cBefore Otto traveled with a tour group on a five-day trip to North Korea, he was a healthy, athletic student of economics and business in his junior year at the University of Virginia, with \u2018big dreams\u2019 and both the smarts and people skills to make him his high school class salutatorian, homecoming king, and prom king,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cHe was blind, deaf, and brain dead when North Korea turned him over to U.S. government officials for his final trip home.\u201dThe arrest and death of Warmbier came during a time of heightened tension between the U.S. and North Korea over the country\u2019s nuclear weapons program. President Donald Trump held a first-of-its-kind summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2018 and plans another next year.The judgment may be mostly a symbolic victory since North Korea has yet to respond to any of the allegations in court and there\u2019s no practical mechanism to force it do so. But the family may nonetheless be able to recoup damages through a Justice Department-administered fund for victims of state-sponsored acts of terrorism, and may look to seize other assets held by the country outside of North Korea.Fred and Cindy Warmbier, who are from a suburb of Cincinnati, said they were thankful the court found the government of Kim Jong Un \u201clegally and morally\u201d responsible for their son\u2019s death.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cWe put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s thoughtful opinion by Chief Judge Howell is a significant step on our journey.\u201dThe lawsuit, filed in April, describes in horrific detail the physical abuse Warmbier endured in North Korean custody, recounting how his parents were \u201cstunned to see his condition\u201d when they boarded a plane to see him upon arrival in the U.S.The 22-year-old was blind and deaf, his arms were curled and mangled and he was jerking violently and howling, completely unresponsive to his family\u2019s attempts to comfort him. His once straight teeth were misaligned, and he had an unexplained scar on his foot. An expert said the injuries suggested he\u2019d been tortured with electric shock, and a neurologist later concluded that the college student suffered brain damage, probably from a loss of blood flow to the brain for five to 20 minutes.North Korea has denied Warmbier was tortured and has said he contracted botulism, though medical experts said there was no evidence of that.The complaint also said Warmbier was pressed to make a televised confession, then convicted of subversion after a short trial. He was denied communication with his family. In June 2017, his parents were informed he was in a coma and had been in that condition for one year.Though foreign nations are generally immune from lawsuits in U.S. courts, Howell cited several exceptions that she said allowed her to hold North Korea liable. Those include the fact that North Korea has been designated by the U.S. as a sponsor of terrorism, that the Warmbiers are U.S. citizens and that the actions of the North Korean government involved torture and hostage taking.The penalty awarded to the Warmbiers and to Otto Warmbier\u2019s estate includes punitive damages as well as damages for economic losses, pain and suffering and medical expenses.The lawsuit was brought on the Warmbiers\u2019 behalf by Richard Cullen, a prominent Virginia lawyer and former U.S. attorney. He told The Associated Press that while \u201cnothing will ever bring Otto back to the Warmbiers or erase their memories of his horrid last 18 months,\u201d the judge\u2019s decision was \u201cvery good news for his family and friends.\u201d___Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/technology-ohio-police-archive-b7f8505aba854eef8368a241968f8938", "headline": "Lakewood Police Department promotes new 911 texting capability ...", "date": "2018-12-03T17:00:29Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "Lakewood Police Department promotes new 911 texting capabilityLAKEWOOD, Ohio -- Residents in need now have another option when contacting emergency services in Lakewood.

In Montgomery County, the administration has approved $53 million through 701 home loans and $7 million through 60 business loans.And even though the deadline to apply for a property damage loan has passed, small businesses, agricultural cooperatives and most private non-profits have until May 25 to apply for what\u2019s called an economic injury disaster loan. Those are loans for businesses that are suffering a decline in business because of the hurricane.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThey\u2019re [the loans] are not necessarily for physical damage to the business, but from customers not coming into the business,\u201d Busch said.The loans are similar to a loan for working capital that a business owner might seek out from a bank, but with lower rates and easier terms. Interest rates for the SBA loans run as low as 3.3 percent for business loans and for private nonprofit organizations the loan rates can be as low as 2.5 percent. The rates are not tied to the prime rate, so they don\u2019t fluctuate. And, as Busch points out, the SBA can offer considerably longer payback terms than banks.\u201cWe can give them up to 30 years for a repayment if they need it,\u201d Busch said.The National Centers For Environmental Information reports the historic rainfall from Hurricane Harvey damaged or destroyed more than 200,000 homes and businesses, causing $125 billion in damage. By comparison, the damage caused after Hurricane Ike came ashore near Galveston in 2008 ended up causing $37.5 billion in damage.For a business owner still hurting from Harvey\u2019s impact, applying for an SBA economic injury disaster loan is like applying for any other loan, officials said.

(Frommer Media LLC via AP)\n            NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 New York City can be an intimidating place for visitors. But travel expert Pauline Frommer is here to help with a new book, \u201cFrommer\u2019s EasyGuide to New York City 2018.\u201dHere are some tips and advice from Frommer\u2019s recent interview with AP Travel\u2019s \u201cGet Outta Here!\u201d podcast :DEALING WITH NEW YORKERSAre New Yorkers scary? Will they step over a body lying in the street or will they help a stranger?\u201cNew Yorkers are incredibly busy people. But kind as well,\u201d Frommer said. \u201cSo if you walk up to somebody who\u2019s rushing by, and ask them to stop, they may not stop. But if you stand on the street corner with a map, within seconds, you will have three people offering to help you.\u201dAs for crime, New York is statistically one of America\u2019s safest big cities, but do keep an eye on your wallet and your purse.And here\u2019s Frommer\u2019s advice for dealing with people who approach you on the street, like costumed character actors in Times Square who offer to pose for photos and then demand payment: \u201cPretend you\u2019re deaf. You just keep walking. ... You maybe can be polite and say, \u2018Sorry,\u2019 and keep walking, but you can\u2019t give them an opening.\u201dADVERTISEMENTHOTEL ADVICEThe idea that you\u2019ll be in walking distance from everything if you stay in Times Square or midtown \u201cis a myth,\u201d Frommer says. So consider staying in downtown Manhattan or even in Queens, including Long Island City, which is just a subway stop or two away from Manhattan. You might end up in \u201ca chain hotel, it might not have that much character,\u201d but rooms can be had for $149.To really save money, \u201cvisit in January or February,\u201d Frommer said. \u201cYou can get a really nice hotel room in February for $99 and that same hotel room in October will cost you $329.\u201dGETTING AROUND\u201cDon\u2019t be scared\u201d of the subway, Frommer says. New Yorkers love complaining about their trains, but Frommer says compared with cabs, they\u2019re cheaper ($2.75 per ride) and usually faster. The trickiest part: Make sure the train is going in the right direction before you swipe your fare card. If not, you may have to exit and pay again on the other side, depending on the station (some provide free transfers in either direction).ADVERTISEMENTBy cab, Frommer says, it\u2019s often faster to hail yellow taxis on the street than wait for Uber or Lyft drivers to arrive. Another option: the Via ride-sharing service, which charges a few dollars a ride.CitiBike, a bike-sharing system, is $12 a day \u201cfor as many half-hour rides as you want,\u201d Frommer says. \u201cBiking is the fastest way to go anywhere. And there are certain streets now that have really good bike lanes that are separated from the traffic.\u201dA FEW FROMMER FAVORITES\u2014Museum: The Metropolitan Museum. \u201cNot only does it have some of the greatest artworks in the world \u2014 Vermeer, Rembrandt, Sergeant \u2014 but it also has things that will engage the imaginations of history-lovers. You can go into an actual Egyptian temple. You can go into a room designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. And for those who don\u2019t love museums, try this: You go into a gallery. You find one thing that interests you and just stand in front of that one thing for two minutes and let it work on you. ... Try and commune with it.\u201d\u2014Freebies: The Staten Island Ferry and Shakespeare in the Park.\u2014Cruise: \u201cThe Circle Line hires out-of-work actors as its guides. So they\u2019re also very well-spoken. They love the history. They know how to tell a story. ... The key is when you enter, sit on the right side of the boat so you\u2019re facing inwards toward Manhattan.\u201d P.S. \u201cThe three-hour tour is too long; take the shorter one.\u201d\u2014Neighborhood: \u201cI\u2019m a big history buff so I love taking friends down to the Financial District.\u201d Sites include St. Paul\u2019s Chapel, where George Washington prayed, and Federal Hall, where he took the oath of office.\u2014Inexpensive restaurant: Dhaulagiri Kitchen, 124 Lexington Ave., serving Himalayan food including fiery curries.\u2014Bar: The Aviary NYC, on the 35th floor of 80 Columbus Circle, with \u201cspectacular\u201d views. \u201cEvery drink there foams or steams or changes as you drink it ... It\u2019s like a Broadway show!\u201d\u2014Jazz: Smoke, 2751 Broadway. \u201cThey have great barbecue while you\u2019re listening to the music,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have really varied programming so one night Brazilian jazz, another night a classical guitarist and it\u2019s a real neighborhood place.\u201d\u2014Weekend itinerary for first-time visitors: \u201cGet up high and go to the top of the Empire State Building or Top of the Rock. ... Go to one of our great museums, maybe take a walking tour. There\u2019s some really good ones, some of them are free. And then, I think it\u2019s not really a weekend in New York if you don\u2019t see a show. It doesn\u2019t have to be Broadway. ... And don\u2019t forget New York City is incredible after dark. So also go to one of our great bars.\u201d___For more tips from Pauline Frommer and \u201cFrommer\u2019s EasyGuide to New York City 2018,\u201d listen to AP Travel\u2019s \u201cGet Outta Here!\u201d podcast on iTunes http://apple.co/2s2ruHY"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/travel-theater-air-travel-transportation-danville-3d7637f115d94d8a9b02f91396c3569a", "headline": "Danville has an airport _ for 2 weekends, it's also a stage | AP News", "date": "2018-10-06T13:46:54Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "DANVILLE, Ky.

It\u2019s a small-yet-busy airport that deals primarily in small planes, general aviation and business travel with 56 planes based there and about 30,00 operations (take offs and landings) a year. In addition, it offers flight training and special aviation events.For the next two weekends, it will also be a theater, hosting the Scarlet Cup Theatre\u2019s production of playwright John Godber\u2019s \u201cDepartures,\u201d a comedy about business people dealing with all the joys of commercial air travel and the strains it puts on their lives and relationships.For Scarlet Cup Theatre, doing a play set in an airport at an airport comes naturally.\u201cOur patrons don\u2019t ask what the next play is, they ask where it is,\u201d board president Elizabeth Orndorff says.The theater company was founded three years ago as a site-specific theater, meaning it tries to present plays in locations relevant to the story. So it has presented parent-teacher drama \u201cGidion\u2019s Knot\u201d at Danville High School, the monk play \u201cAidan\u2019s Gift\u201d at Danville\u2019s Third Street Methodist Church, and the death\u2019s door drama \u201cMare Rider\u201d at the hospital-like environment of the Kentucky School for the Deaf.Even before launching, Danville was already a town with a high number of theaters per capita with Pioneer Playhouse, West. T. Hill Community Theatre, and Centre College theater. Orndorff says the company sought to find its own niche, which was informed by its founders\u2019 desires.\u201cWe thought it would be fun to do plays that nobody else was doing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe wanted to see contemporary plays, cutting-edge plays, dramas, international plays. So we said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we start our own theater?\u2019\u201cGood idea, but we don\u2019t want the financial burden of owning a theater. Why don\u2019t we do a site-specific theater where every play is at a different place.\u201dADVERTISEMENTAnother one of the theater\u2019s board members is retired Centre College drama professor Anthony Haigh, who makes annual trips to England and has gotten to know Godber, one of the most popular playwrights in Britain. When Haigh came back last time with Godber\u2019s \u201cDepartures,\u201d Orndorff said there was only one answer.\u201cWe have to do it at the airport,\u201d she said.The airport ... or its board, at least ... couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201cWe consider it to be the most important mile of asphalt in the county,\u201d Stuart Powell Field board president Rob Caldwell says. \u201cBut a lot of people don\u2019t know we\u2019re out here.\u201dThe play gives the airport a chance to get more people into the facility who aren\u2019t catching or arriving on flights.The airport also serves as the launch site for the annual balloon race during Danville\u2019s Great American Brass Band Festival.\u201cEven among the people in the theater who\u2019ve been out here practicing, we\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018We didn\u2019t realize this place was so busy,\u2019\u201d Caldwell says.All of the action will take place in the airport\u2019s lounge, as the play is set in lounges around Europe and the United States. For the show, a simple set of stage lights has been brought in, and there will be seating for between 40 and 50, for each of the eight performances.\u201cWorking on something so intimate really allows the acting to come forth and the audience to be very attached to the work,\u201d says New York-based actor Fannie Lemasters, who worked at Pioneer Playhouse this summer and stuck around for \u201cDepartures.\u201dIn addition to the play, patrons are likely to see airport activity as planes arrive into the evening, often with business people coming back from meetings and the like. In fact, the company was asked to move its regular Sunday afternoon matinee to the evening because Sunday is one of the airport\u2019s busiest days.\u201cWe really like this balance of finding the right play and the right location,\u201d Haigh says. \u201cAnd the audience is excited by that. Some people are intimidated by the notion of theater, where you dress up and go to this special place that\u2019s all dark, and velvet seats. But to go to a church or KSD or a high school classroom, or even an airport, they\u2019re comfortable with that.\u201cAnd our audience is very vocal: \u2018Where are you going next?\u2019\u201d___Information from: Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/health-florida-jacksonville-gorillas-f7e150c7f09844a9a1571db1e63f30f5", "headline": "Endangered western lowland gorilla born at Florida zoo | AP News", "date": "2018-10-04T06:06:07Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla.

He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the U.S. in a coma and showing apparent signs of torture while in custody.ADVERTISEMENTHowell wrote in her opinion: \u201cBefore Otto traveled with a tour group on a five-day trip to North Korea, he was a healthy, athletic student of economics and business in his junior year at the University of Virginia, with \u2018big dreams\u2019 and both the smarts and people skills to make him his high school class salutatorian, homecoming king, and prom king.\u201dShe added: \u201cHe was blind, deaf, and brain dead when North Korea turned him over to U.S. government officials for his final trip home.\u201dThe arrest and death of Warmbier came during a time of heightened tension between the U.S. and North Korea over the isolated country\u2019s nuclear weapons program. President Donald Trump held a first-of-its-kind summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2018 and plans another next year.The judgment may be mostly a symbolic victory for now since North Korea has yet to respond to any of the allegations in court and there\u2019s no practical mechanism for forcing it to do so.But the family may nonetheless be able to recoup damages through a Justice Department-administered fund for victims of state-sponsored acts of terrorism and may look to tap into other assets belonging to the country.Fred and Cindy Warmbier said they were thankful that that the court found the government of Kim Jong Un \u201clegally and morally\u201d responsible for their son\u2019s death.\u201cWe put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cToday\u2019s thoughtful opinion by Chief Judge Howell is a significant step on our journey.\u201dADVERTISEMENTThe lawsuit, filed in April, describes in horrific detail the physical abuse Warmbier endured in North Korean custody.When his parents boarded a plane to see him upon arrival in the U.S., they were \u201cstunned to see his condition,\u201d according to court documents.The 22-year-old was blind and deaf, his arms were curled and mangled and he was jerking violently and howling, completely unresponsive to his family\u2019s attempts to comfort him. His once straight teeth were misaligned, and he had an unexplained scarred wound on his foot. An expert said in court papers that the injuries suggested he had been tortured with electrocution.A neurologist later concluded that the college student suffered brain damage, probably from a loss of blood flow to the brain for five to 20 minutes.North Korea has denied that Warmbier was tortured and has said he contracted botulism while in custody.The complaint also said Warmbier, who was from a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, was pressed to make a televised confession, then convicted of subversion after a one-hour trial. He was denied communication with his family. In early June 2017, his parents were informed he was in a coma and had been in that condition for one year.Though foreign nations are generally immune from being sued in United States courts, Howell cited several exceptions that she said allowed the case to move forward and for her to hold North Korea liable. Those include the fact that North Korea has been designated by the U.S. as a sponsor of terrorism, that the Warmbiers are U.S. citizens and that North Koreans\u2019 conduct amounts to torture and hostage taking.The penalty awarded by Howell to the Warmbiers and to Otto Warmbier\u2019s estate includes punitive damages as well as damages for economic losses, pain and suffering and medical expenses.The lawsuit was brought on the Warmbiers\u2019 behalf by Richard Cullen, a prominent Virginia lawyer and former United States attorney."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/florence-archive-055a318076514e65beb9737b05592749", "headline": "Florence Center holds ribbon cutting | AP News", "date": "2018-01-25T03:48:08Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "FLORENCE, S.C. \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re at the Center\u201d is the motto for the newly branded Florence Center.Employees and executives from the Florence Center joined ambassadors from the Greater Florence Chamber of Commerce to hold a ribbon cutting Wednesday to celebrate the opening of the expanded facility that features 25,000 additional square feet of space.Paul Beard, general manager of the Florence Center, said he was excited to officially open the new expansion.\u201cThis is phenomenal,\u201d Beard said. \u201cThe economic impact of our existing building was $42 million, and those funds help to drive what\u2019s going on downtown as well as in the hospitality district.

For Mendenhall, treating his cerebral palsy has helped him to live quite an abnormal life.This weekend, Mendenhall, 35, is checking into The Looney Bin in Bradley with his band, The Mendenhall Experiment, to play a 10-year anniversary show on Saturday.\u201cThe band\u2019s founding premise was to raise disability awareness and be a positive voice for the community,\u201d Mendenhall said.ADVERTISEMENTEvery case of CP is different, Mendenhall explains. For him, it has caused significant impairments on the left side of his body and has affected his speech and movement.\u201cI have nine screws and a steel plate in my foot,\u201d Mendenhall admits.He\u2019s had about 10 surgeries on his left foot, which has allowed him to regain proper movement in the limb.There is no steadfast cure for CP, but treatments such as physical therapy, medication and surgery can alleviate symptoms and help individuals with CP live a more normal life.Many people doubt the abilities and talents of those with cerebral palsy, Mendenhall said. Even his own grandfather explicitly told a young and eager Mendenhall that he could never fulfill his dreams of becoming a musician.Then Mendenhall proved everyone wrong.He taught himself how to play guitar at age 19, then moved to Los Angeles a day before his 21st birthday to pursue a music career.\u201cI lived in a duffel bag and slept on couches for a while,\u201d Mendenhall said.He moved thousands of miles across the country to become someone greater and to prove to himself and the people who doubted him that his disability does not define him or his future. And he succeeded.He formed The Mendenhall Experiment in August 2008, six years after his graduation from Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School. They played their very first show at Paul\u2019s Place in Kankakee.Today, Mendenhall plays guitar for the band, sharing the stage with lead vocalist Mario Valadez, lead guitarist Mike Lira, drummer Bruce Lira and bass player Nathan Stockton.Like Mendenhall, Stockon has battled disabilities of his own. Born partially deaf, he wears hearing aids almost all the time, with the exception of when the band is performing on stage.ADVERTISEMENTStockton also has developed a degenerative eye disease and is losing his eyesight. Stockton and Mendenhall are two examples of how music can be used to overcome challenges and disabilities. It\u2019s what The Mendenhall Experiment stands for. They are heavy metal music \u201cwith a positive outlook.\u201dMendenhall wants the public to know that people with disabilities are \u201ccapable of more than you give us credit for.\u201dHis efforts to reshape the narrative surrounding CP and other disabilities has not gone unnoticed.In 2015, Mendenhall received the first Trailblazer Award from United Cerebral Palsy of Los Angeles, an organization dedicated to helping people live with the disorder.\u201cMind Over Matter,\u201d a documentary about Mendenhall\u2019s battle with cerebral palsy and his efforts to overcome his disabilities through music, has received critical acclaim. The documentary premiered at the ReelAbilities Film Festival in New York in February and received several awards, including Best Cinematography, Best Screenwriting and an Audience Award from the DOC LA film festival.Directed and filmed by award-winning filmmaker S\u00e9bastien Paquet, the film details Mendenhall\u2019s early life in Bradley and the current life he spends in LA and on the road with the band. The Kankakee area is heavily featured in the film, and it includes a cameo appearance and special tribute to the late Daily Journal reporter Dennis Yohnka, who wrote about Mendenhall and the band in the past.The documentary will be released to digital streaming services, such as Amazon and iTunes, in October.Since the band\u2019s inception 10 years ago, they have been making a solid name for themselves in the heavy rock community. In the past, they\u2019ve shared a stage with Avenged Sevenfold, Papa Roach and Korn, a band that holds a special place in Mendenhall\u2019s heart.The guitarist of Korn, James Shaffer, was hugely influential to Mendenhall while growing up with CP.Shaffer, known by his stage name of \u201cMunky,\u201d lost the tip of a finger in an accident. Instead of allowing the disability to defeat him, Shaffer learned to play guitar as a form of rehabilitation.A young Mendenhall read Shaffer\u2019s story and was immensely inspired.\u201cIf he can become a musician,\u201d Mendenhall thought, \u201cwhy can\u2019t I?\u201dToday, Mendenhall and Shaffer have become good friends after sharing a stage together in the past.Aside from performing with top acts such as Korn, the band reached another milestone when they signed with Lucent Records, an independent label distributed by Universal Music Group. They released their first single, \u201cSeize the Day,\u201d in 2016, which has been streamed more than 15,000 times on Spotify.The band\u2019s self-titled EP, released in 2017, is their first full-length record released as a signed band. Much to Mendenhall\u2019s delight, Shaffer makes an appearance in the song \u201cProsthetic.\u201d The album is available to stream on Spotify and available to purchase on digital platforms such as iTunes.Though they are based in LA, the band frequently returns to the Kankakee area to play homecoming shows. Their Saturday show marks their third annual homecoming show at The Looney Bin.\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember your roots,\u201d Mendenhall said.He particularly enjoys the band\u2019s summer homecoming shows because they allow him to return to the area with a sense of accomplishment.\u201cWe love playing The Bin because of its intimate, raw, no frills environment. [The owner] Nick [Huffman] and I go back about 20 years,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe attended BBCHS together and went to many rock-metal shows in Chicago together. Back in those days, if you wanted to see a national touring artist, you had to make the drive to Chicago. I\u2019m proud of Nick for using his love of music to change all that for the community by creating ... The Bin.\u201dThe band\u2019s 10-year \u201canniversary bash\u201d at The Looney Bin in Bradley marks a brief pause in their current national tour, The Flawless Smile Tour, with bands Flaw, Smile Empty Soul and New Lingo. The Mendenhall Experiment\u2019s run in The Flawless Smile Tour begins today in Dubuque, Iowa, and ends in Galt, Calif., Sept. 15.During The Looney Bin show, longtime fans of the band might be pleased to hear old songs from The Mendenhall Experiment\u2019s self-released EP, \u201cReturn to Chaos,\u201d and can expect a few pleasant surprises during the night.To rock out with The Mendenhall Experiment and their guests, Bad Influence and The Unlawful, get tickets at the Outhouse Tickets website. General admission is $10, VIP is $20 and dinner from Bull\u2019s BBQ in Bradley with a reserved seat is an extra $10. Tickets also can be purchased at the door for a higher price.The Looney Bin\u2019s doors open at 7 p.m. for the show to begin at 8 p.m. The show only admits those age 21 and older.The Mendenhall Experiment\u2019s dedication to playing music and inspiring audiences says they don\u2019t need fancy venues or high-priced tickets to put on a fantastic show.\u201cYou could give me a stage or a sidewalk,\u201d Mendenhall said, \u201cI\u2019ll play anywhere.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/e1446911044d4e0ba736f1acfe6501ec", "headline": "WSU study finds people with disabilities benefitted from health ...", "date": "2018-02-22T08:40:02Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "People with disabilities benefited significantly from the Affordable Care Act through both expanded access to Medicaid and being able to purchase private insurance, a Washington State University study found.The paper, published in late 2017 in the journal Inquiry, compared both health coverage and access to care among working-age adults with and without disabilities, drawing on responses to the National Health Interview Survey.Researchers found people with disabilities were far more likely to have insurance through a public health insurance program. Among those who had private insurance, people with disabilities were more likely to have a plan purchased on a state exchange, rather than through work.ADVERTISEMENTAnd even when they had insurance, many people with disabilities reported delaying or not receiving needed medical care due to high cost.Jae Kennedy, the lead author and a professor in WSU\u2019s School of Health Policy and Administration, said the ACA was important because many people with disabilities are unable to work full-time. Since most working-age Americans receive insurance through work, that made coverage difficult.\u201cNobody really made a formal decision to link health insurance to employment. It just kind of happened,\u201d he said.Most part-time workers can\u2019t get insurance through work, and buying private health insurance wasn\u2019t an option because pre-existing conditions precluded many disabled people from coverage. The ACA required insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, opening up the health care marketplace.\u201cPeople with chronic illness and disability, for the first time, really, in the history of health insurance in this country, could get private health insurance,\u201d Kennedy said.Miriam Hertz, an independent living advocate with Disability Action Center Northwest in Moscow, Idaho, said she\u2019s seen that in both her own experience and her work with clients. She signed up for an exchange plan shortly after the ACA\u2019s markets were established and said she has seen many people benefit from the pre-existing conditions protection.\u201cThere was a time when I was told that because of my stuttering I would have a hard time getting private health care coverage,\u201d she said.But the benefits of Medicaid expansion have left her clients behind, since Idaho opted not to expand the program.\u201cThe biggest plus for people with disabilities coming out of the ACA era is actually the expansion of Medicaid which is on a state-by-state basis,\u201d she said.ADVERTISEMENTAnd access remains a concern, she said. Beyond the cost of care, people with disabilities often have trouble getting rides to appointments or needed accommodations at doctor offices, like accessible entrances or sign language interpreters.Because the study is based on survey data, it doesn\u2019t show whether people who newly enrolled in Medicaid would have been eligible before the expansion. And Kennedy notes that other factors, like recovery from the Great Recession, may also play a role in expanded coverage.Kennedy is the head of a five-institution Collaborative on Health Reform and Independent Living, which is looking into the effect of health reform on people with disabilities.Liz Wood, a WSU research professor who\u2019s finishing her doctorate at the University of North Carolina in health services research, said the hope is to focus more discussion on health coverage on some of the highest users of the medical system, who often aren\u2019t specifically written about in research.\u201cThey spend so much more on health care, and they earn so much less, on average,\u201d she said.CHRIL has published prior research showing people with disabilities were more likely to be employed following the ACA\u2019s implementation in states that expanded Medicaid. About 38 percent of people with disabilities were working in Medicaid expansion states in 2014-15, versus 32 percent in nonMedicaid expansion states.Kennedy said access to Medicaid or other public programs can actually help people with disabilities stay in part-time jobs, because it doesn\u2019t tie their insurance to disability benefits.When people are covered through federal disability programs, they can fall into a trap where they lose benefits if they have outside income. That means someone who is only able to work part-time at jobs that don\u2019t offer coverage has an incentive not to work at all.\u201cIf you have other options for health insurance, you don\u2019t have this kind of existential crisis where you have to drop out\u201d of the labor force, Kennedy said."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/8a32c231cb3c4b6ba560c267d537cde5", "headline": "Old-fashioned Christmas continues at Heritage Farm | AP News", "date": "2018-12-09T07:28:28Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "HUNTINGTON \u2014 An old-fashioned Christmas weekend continued for the second week at Heritage Farm Museum & Village\u2019s Christmas Village presentation Saturday just outside of downtown Huntington.Laura Lake, 85, of Huntington, said coming to see the white lights stretched along the log cabin village with its old wooden buildings and barns is like stepping back in time.\u201cI love the smell of the wood burning, and I like to think about how folks lived years ago in this type of setting,\u201d Lake said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the kids to learn about the Appalachian way of life and the things they did back then and how they celebrated Christmas.

He was kindly and quiet, but I didnt know he was once the states director of special education.Groos, 91, died Jan. 27 of congestive heart failure.In 1966, as the states director of special education, Groos was responsible for implementing the 1957 Special Education Law that required education services be provided for children and youths with disabilities.Before then, school districts didnt have to serve children with disabilities. Visually impaired children went to their own state school. Any school that wanted state aid for students with disabilities needed to have at least five.ADVERTISEMENTSchools could choose to provide services or not, so some students were at home or institutionalized, said Robert Wedl, Minnesotas commissioner of education in the late 1990s. John implemented the law, traveling around the state explaining to superintendents what needed to be done, talking to colleges about the need for special education teachers and launching in-service training sessions for teachers.It wasnt easy. There was pushback from administrators, a teacher shortage and budgetary concerns. People were concerned about how it would get done, but John had this calming effect. Hed lay out a plan, talk about how services were being put into place and identify where the resources were coming from, Wedl said. andthinsp;You can only eat an elephant one bite at a time, John would say.Son David Groos of Minneapolis said the lesson he learned early from his dad was to listen to voices that arent in the mainstream, whether it was from blind or deaf students, or those who were dyslexic or disenfranchised. Several days before he died, he videotaped messages for his grandkids. He told one of his granddaughters, If you have good thoughts about how the world should be run, get in there and fight for it,andthinsp; his son said.His daughter-in-law Maria Groos of Minneapolis grew up in Guatemala. She was nervous about meeting her future father-in-law for the first time. She memorized how to say, Hi, how are you, in English when she first met him but forgot it. His smile said it all. We did not need to know the language, she said.Norena Hale of Plymouth, whos written two books about the 1957 Special Education Law, said Groos was also an early advocate for affirmative action. In a gentle way he kept pushing for women and minorities to be promoted, she said. Hale succeeded Groos as the states director of special education after he retired in 1980.ADVERTISEMENTGroos believed in empowering people, Wedl said. Affirmative action was not a priority in the 1960s, but he put women and people of color in leadership positions.Wedl said Groos wife, Virginia, helped shape his ideas. She was a feminist and a strong leader. She worked as an HR person and had a lot of influence on him, he said.People described Groos as a person who preferred to listen rather than talk, especially to people who werent always the center of attention. In conversations about minorities or immigrants, it was clear that he wanted all of us to do a better job of taking care of people who dont have a big voice, the underdogs, Tellekson said.Besides his son David, Groos is survived by his wife, Virginia of Minneapolis; children Julia LeGrande of Atlanta, Katherine Jones of Wales, U.K., Annette Brisse of Coon Rapids; his sister, Barbara Budinger of Marquette, Mich., and 11 grandchildren.

The board also OK\u2019d a proposed lower property tax rate for 2018 and an overall proposed 2019 budget of $124.2 million.According to a press release from township officials, the proposed 2018 property tax rate of 22.73 cents per $100 of taxable property value was tentatively approved pending a final vote scheduled for the board\u2019s normal meeting on Wednesday, Aug. 22. Because that tax amount is the same as the effective tax rate that was earlier set by the Montgomery County Tax Assessor\u2019s Office, there is no legal requirement to have two public hearings on the tax rate, the release stated, meaning scheduled public hearings set for Aug. 29 and Sept. 5 have been cancelled. The board will not vote on the final budget on Sept. 12 as originally planned, instead it is an agenda item for Wednesday, Aug. 22.ADVERTISEMENTMonique Sharp, assistant general manager for finance and administration for The Woodlands, said the lowered 2018 proposed tax rate will \u2014 on average \u2014 offset any potential property value increases that both commercial and residential property owners may have experienced in the past year.\u201cThe board lowered the tax rate to the (county) effective tax rate, from 23 cents (per $100 valuation) to 22.73 cents. Every year, the board is very mindful of what the effective tax rate is,\u201d Sharp explained. \u201c(The effective tax rate) Negates the effect of increase in taxable (property) value between the two years. If your new tax statement came out and (your) property (value) went up by 2 percent, (the effective tax rate) negates the increase in property taxes.\u201dSharp said under the rejected 23 cents per $100 valuation rate, the township would have corralled about $845,000 more in property tax revenue, while the proposed 22.73 cents per $100 valuation rate will bring in roughly $307,000 in property tax revenue.In addition to lowering the property tax rate, the board powered through the first four days of the budget workshop process, eliminating the need for a fifth scheduled workshop originally scheduled for the morning of Friday, Aug. 17, Sharp added.The proposed $122.5 million budget from earlier in the budget workshop process was increased to about $124.2 million, Sharp said, after board members, \u201cmade some adjustments\u201d to the budget in specific areas.ADVERTISEMENTIncluded in the changes that led to the more than $1.7 million expenditures increase are:Accelerated the digitazing of township property records, going from all paper to a digital, computed-based records system.Implementing closed captioning on township meeting videos for deaf or hearing impaired viewers.Approving business plans to expedite the construction of an adventure park course at Rob Fleming Park.Approving an expanded parking lot at Timarron Park.OK\u2019d adding eight new tennis courts and a roofing structure to cover basketball courts at Bear Branch Park.Sharp said one of the bigger cost items was the digitizing the township\u2019s property records, a project she said was initially supposed to take longer but one that board members had a desire to speed up.\u201cWe were going to do it over a five-year period, but now it will be done in three years,\u201d Sharp said. The project began in 2017 and was expected to be completed in 2021, but is now on scheduled to be completed by the end of the 2019 calendar year.As for other changes, Sharp said the adventure course will be paid for out of the 2019 budget, but board members believed the expected revenue from the new park \u2014 which is hoped to include zip lines and other obstacles \u2014 in its first year of operation would offset the 2019 cost and make it a revenue neutral project after the first year of operation.Adding the eight tennis courts to Bear Branch Park was a result of public feedback on amenities in the township, Sharp added.\u201cThe demand for tennis (is high),\u201d she explained.The proposed 2018 tax rate and the proposed 2019 budget is scheduled to be voted on by the full board at its meeting scheduled for 4 p.m., Wednesday, Aug. 22."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/business-connecticut-new-haven-bridgeport-ben-carson-8e9a018147ee4e2f98c492a26f37be9d", "headline": "HUD plan raises rents on poor | AP News", "date": "2018-04-28T00:22:09Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "A plan by the Trump administration to triple rents for the nation\u2019s poorest families is running into a wall of opposition from fair housing advocates and members of Connecticut\u2019s Congressional delegation.Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson last week proposed raising rents and adding work requirements for the millions of low income residents living at public housing authorities or receiving Section 8 rental vouchers.The HUD proposal represents one of the most far reaching overhauls of federal public housing assistance in decades and will impact thousands for residents in large cities such as Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford, as well as smaller communities such as Norwalk, Stamford, Danbury and Middletown.The Bridgeport Housing Authority, for example, annually helps 12,000 people find affordable housing and manages nearly 2,600 public housing units and 2,800 Section 8 vouchers.ADVERTISEMENTCarson said the bill seeks to \u201creform decades-old rent policies that are confusing, costly and counterproductive, in that the incentives they create often fail to adequately support individuals and families receiving HUD rental assistance in increasing their earnings.\u201dCapitol Siege: One Year LaterWhat does Ivanka Trump know about Jan. 6? Congress is askingNJ man pleads guilty in Jan. 6 riot; saw Babbitt shootingOath Keepers leader talks to Jan. 6 panel from federal jail Brooklyn judge's son pleads guilty to Capitol riot chargesBut the reforms are drawing fierce opposition from Democrats and local housing advocates who say the bill is a thinly veiled attempt to reduce federal subsidies for low income families and plunge millions into deeper poverty and homelessness.\u201cThe ink is barely dry on President Trump\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest individuals and largest corporations, and now his administration is proposing to triple rent for low-income families,\u201d said Gov. Dannel P. Malloy.\u201cThis is yet another example of remarkably out-of-whack priorities from the Trump administration,\u201d Malloy said. \u201cSecretary Carson should rescind this outrageous and harmful proposal.\u201dThe bill \u2014 dubbed the \u201cMaking Affordable Housing Work Act\u201d \u2014 seeks to amend the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 and other laws to \u201cencourage families to achieve self-sufficiency and for administrative efficiency.\u201dHousing advocates say the bill raises the base rent calculation for those living in public housing authorities or receiving federal rental assistance from 30 percent of gross income to 35 percent.For the poorest families, the base rent of $50 a month would rise to $150 a month \u2014 triple what they pay now.The changes would impact about half of the 4.7 million families nationally who receive federal housing assistance and about 77,000 families in Connecticut.U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, called the proposal \u201cdraconian\u201d and said it will hurt millions of low income families.Most vulnerableThe bill also seeks to place more work requirements on low income recipients living in communities where entry level jobs are in short supply. Other Republican bills would add work requirements on food stamps and Medicaid recipients.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThose who live in public housing are the most economically vulnerable among us \u2014 they do so because they simply can\u2019t afford higher rents,\u201d said New Haven Mayor Toni Harp.\u201cThis recent HUD proposal again betrays the extent to which the current administration is blind and deaf to the needs of the needy,\u201d Harp said.The HUD secretary told Washington reporters last week that current spending on housing is \u201cunsustainable\u201d and rental assistance is not reaching all who qualify, noting many remain on waiting lists for years.\u201cEvery year, it takes more money, millions of dollars more, to serve the same number of households,\u201d Carson said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from a budget perspective and a human point of view that the current system is unsustainable.\u201dEvonne Klein, commissioner of the state Department of Housing, said those receiving rental assistance are the working poor.\u201cBy tripling their rent, it will not put those families on the road to self-sufficiency,\u201d Klein said. \u201cRather, it will put them on the road to homelessness.\u201dCurrent policies workingErin Boggs, executive director of the Open Communities Alliance, said Carson \u201cmisunderstands\u201d his own agency\u2019s programs.\u201cOne of the key purposes is to help households who can\u2019t otherwise manage on their own to find and keep stable housing,\u201d Boggs said. \u201cCutting off these families will result in drastic increases in homelessness and increase the number of children in the foster care system.\u201dBoggs said Carson claims that current programs are not working when in fact they are assisting hundreds of thousands of families every day.She said a recent survey of the Hartford Section 8 voucher program found that 73 percent of the families receiving assistance were elderly, disabled or working, and the remainder had preschool-aged children.Jeffery Ingraham, vice chairman of the Norwalk Housing Authority, said the HUD proposal is not welcome news.\u201cI think it would present a tremendous burden to a lot of families,\u201d Ingraham said, noting some Section 8 residents pay no rent.Boggs said there is \u201cinterplay\u201d between housing and employment. \u201cIf the minimum wage is insufficient to cover rents, families will need housing assistance even if they include a full-time worker,\u201d she said.Call to actionU.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4, said Carson\u2019s proposals will only worsen the cycle of poverty and dependence on government assistance.\u201cHaving worked on affordable housing issues for many years, I know that the most effective way to help struggling families is through community engagement, ensuring fair costs and education,\u201d Himes said.\u201cMost households that qualify for federal housing assistance are already below the poverty line,\u201d Himes said. \u201cBurdening them with higher rents and other costs will only worsen their hardship and force more families into financial crises.\u201dBlumenthal said he\u2019s gearing up for a fight against Carson\u2019s reforms.\u201cUnfortunately, this kind of draconian, discriminatory punishment \u2014 while shocking in its cruelty \u2014 is no surprise coming from an administration that has repeatedly proven to value Mar-a-Lago members over working families,\u201d Blumenthal said.bcummings@ctpost.com"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-hazleton-donald-trump-archive-fugitives-573cd9cd91fb4c5ea1120a8618081a47", "headline": "Law Enforcement: Top Priority Is To Find Fugitive, Van | AP News", "date": "2018-08-02T04:01:00Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "WEST HAZLETON \u2014 A man resembling fugitive Shawn Christy stole a uniquely marked school bus company van Sunday night, officials say.Christy, 26, has been wanted for making threats against President Donald Trump, law enforcement and others since June 20 when state and federal agents, along with local police, showed up at his McAdoo home.A backpack-clad man similar in appearance to Christy stole the silver 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan van from Rohrer Bus Co., off Route 309 in Drums, on Sunday.

Instead, law enforcement encourages anyone who knows his location or who sees the van to call 911, the U.S. Marshals\u2019 tipline at 877-926-8332 or the FBI at 215-418-4000.Clark said federal agents were alerted to the burglary and vehicle theft at Rohrer on Wednesday morning.

When asked if law enforcement was concerned that Christy was still on the run with a visit from Trump scheduled Thursday in Wilkes-Barre Twp., he responded that anyone who threatens or allegedly threatens someone else is always a concern to law enforcement. Officials are concerned with bringing Christy into custody as soon as possible, Pane said.ADVERTISEMENTChristy is wanted in Northampton, Schuylkill, Carbon and Luzerne counties for other cases, some of which occurred while he was on the run. In addition, he\u2019s wanted for threats he\u2019s accused of making through social media posts between June 3 and 12 against Trump, the Northampton County District Attorney and law enforcement. Authorities say Christy threatened to \u201cput a bullet\u201d in Trump\u2019s head. A federal arrest warrant was issued for Christy by the U.S. District Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania, Wilkes-Barre, after he was charged with interstate communication of threats and threats against the president of the United States.Law enforcement searched wooded areas and buildings in McAdoo and Kline Twp. beginning June 20, and then turned their search north after Christy allegedly stole a vehicle from his former employer in Banks Twp. on July 7. The vehicle was later ditched near the Canadian border where law enforcement found it the following day.Marshals said he is then believed to have stolen a vehicle in New York, about 10 miles away from Constable, later abandoning it after it overheated on Interstate 81. Then on July 17, federal, state and local law enforcement searched woods behind the Scranton School for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Children in Clarks Green, Lackawanna County, after video surveillance from four days earlier showed someone who \u201cstrongly resembles\u201d Christy breaking in and stealing food.Christy allegedly broke into his uncle\u2019s home in Butler Twp. on July 25, taking handguns and leaving notes behind for his mother and uncle.Law enforcement said he stands about 5 feet, 10 inches tall, has brown hair and green eyes and weighs 150 to 165 pounds. He may or may not have facial hair.Contact the writer:achristman@standardspeaker.com; 570-501-3584"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/harlingen-72589b97a812451ebc3d9ab89cf253bc", "headline": "Local couple help Harlingen Humane Society adoptions | AP News", "date": "2018-09-01T09:10:35Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "By ALANA HERNANDEZStaff WriterHARLINGEN \u2014 As you walk into the front door, you\u2019re greeted by an array of five to six cats.There are fluffy cats, short-haired cats, three legged cats, you name it. All of the cats look different. However, they all have one thing in common.They\u2019re survivors.At some point in their lives they came across a stroke of luck after being taken in by one of the Harlingen Humane Society\u2019s most successful animal foster parents.Meet the couple who have helped save more than 250 cats and kittens get adopted. Their work has helped place many cats from the Harlingen Humane Society into their forever homes since they decided to become foster parents three years ago.\u201cWe\u2019re not dog people, we\u2019re cat people,\u201d Sean Blancher said. \u201cWe especially find that there are less cat people than there are dog people. So, we figure that cats need a chance just as much as the dogs,\u201d he added.ADVERTISEMENTSean has described himself as a cat person ever since he and his wife Elizabeth adopted their first cat from the Humane Society 18 years ago.This month was their three-year anniversary as cat foster parents. They help the Humane Society take care of kittens by raising them until they\u2019re old enough to be placed on an adoption lineup at places like PetSmart and Petco.Every day, animals arrive at the Humane Society. However, as the number of cats and dogs increase, someone has to go, whether through adoption, transport, fostering or, unfortunately, euthanasia.Summer is an especially slow time for adoptions. So, they\u2019re asking for the public\u2019s help in saving the lives of cats and kittens that arrive at the Humane Society by making donations, adopting or fostering.These animal foster parents love knowing that they\u2019ve helped find homes for several kittens they\u2019ve taken care of. To them, fostering cats and kittens is both a joy and a blessing.\u201cWe love what we do \u2014 the joys, the tears and sometimes even sleepless nights when we\u2019re trying to help our kittens eat,\u201d Elizabeth said.\u201cIt\u2019s like having little children, but we wouldn\u2019t give up a minute of it because the love the cats give back is worth it,\u201d she added.Elizabeth said some people think becoming a foster parent means they\u2019re going to need to foster for two years or more. However, the time commitment can be much shorter than that.She described fostering kittens as a very short-term situation. Taking care of them for two or three months could be a great help to the Humane Society.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be stuck with a kitty unless you fall in love with it and you don\u2019t want to give it up. Which does happen,\u201d Elizabeth said laughing.Elizabeth describes cats as \u201cindependent, low maintenance animals that just need food, water and fresh kitty litter.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how old or young cats are,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a match with someone.\u201dADVERTISEMENTFor example, Sean recalled his most memorable adoption happened when one couple decided to adopt a deaf kitten they were fostering that had \u201cabsolutely no chance of getting adopted.\u201dHe didn\u2019t think she would be adopted because a lot of people want perfect kittens.\u201cFor every 25 perfect kittens that people want, I find one person who wants ones that are struggling and are hard to get adopted,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019d love to see all of the cats I foster go into good homes and get lots of loving.\u201dSean said it\u2019s an extremely satisfying and rewarding experience to know that they\u2019re helping save cats lives.\u201cI try to stay in contact with as many people as I can who adopt our kitties,\u201d Sean said. \u201cThey send me pictures every now and then. It\u2019s great to see that these kittens are doing so well,\u201d he added.Trez and Alltoes are two special cats Sean and his wife are fostering right now that are available for adoption. Trez is a three-legged domestic short-hair mix that \u201cloves getting attention and gets along well with other cats.\u201d Alltoes is a polydactyl cat, which means he was born with extra toes on his paws, hence, the inspiration for his name. He is a laid-back, shy cat that also has swimmer\u2019s syndrome which causes developmental deformities. When Alltoes was born, he couldn\u2019t walk. However, with Sean and Elizabeth\u2019s help, he walks \u201calmost normal\u201d now.\u201cA lot of times the Humane Society can\u2019t afford to treat sick kitties,\u201d Sean said. \u201cSo, we try to help them get healthy again and have a chance. Just because they got sick doesn\u2019t mean that they have to go to heaven.\u201dSean and Elizabeth have helped save the lives of several kittens and cats over the years. However, they \u201cstill would love to see more kittens and cats get adopted and fostered.\u201d\u201cI wish I could find 100 more other people who could foster and adopt,\u201d Sean said. \u201cThen, no kittens would have to be euthanized,\u201d he added."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/north-america-us-news-ap-top-news-houston-politics-8e37bd6036ec4412a45544fdb7e4179e", "headline": "About 2,500 mourners pay respects to Barbara Bush at viewing | AP ...", "date": "2018-04-20T22:42:29Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 His daughter standing behind him, former President George H.W.

A string of mourners began to approach: adults and children, many of the women wearing his wife\u2019s favorite color, blue, and trademark pearls.

Her body was to be in repose from noon until midnight. A spray of dozens of roses covered the closed light-colored metallic casket.The 93-year-old former president arrived at the church shortly after the viewing opened, accompanied by daughter Dorothy Bush Koch. He hadn\u2019t been scheduled to visit, but he decided to go after watching video from the church, said family spokesman Jim McGrath. Bush shook dozens of hands and stayed for about 15 minutes.\u201cI think he was very touched by all of the people who were taking the time out of their lives,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cIt was just a natural inclination for him.\u201dLucy Orlando was one of the more than 100 people in line well before bus service began from a separate location to the church.

After years of watching non-trans stars win accolades \u2014 including Oscars \u2014 for what was seen as bravery in playing transgender characters, finally it seemed that somebody got it.\u201cTo have someone with any amount of power be reflective, and say, \u2018I did something wrong, I learned something and I\u2019m sorry\u2019 \u2014 that absolutely feels like change,\u201d says Schofield, a veteran trans performer who stars in the upcoming European film \u201cThe Conductor.\u201dADVERTISEMENTNow, Schofield and others hope Hollywood will understand an even bigger point \u2014 that the \u201cauthentic casting\u201d debate stoked by the Johansson episode isn\u2019t just about who gets acting roles. The real goal, he says, is access for the transgender community at every level of the Hollywood storytelling process, from the first idea pitch to the final product. \u201cWe need to take the reins here,\u201d Schofield says. \u201cWe need to be a substantive part of this conversation.\u201dAdvocates are hoping that the current focus on transgender Hollywood will help. \u201cHollywood right now is being very introspective about the stories it\u2019s telling and how it\u2019s telling them,\u201d says Nick Adams, director of the transgender media program at GLAAD, the LGBT advocacy group. \u201cWe\u2019re having a cultural moment where the trans community is speaking up and saying, \u2018We want to be part of that.\u2019\u201dTo that end, GLAAD and the equality organization 50/50BY2020 on Tuesday issued an \u201copen letter to Hollywood,\u201d signed by a large array of organizations and companies \u2014 from the American Civil Liberties Union to Time\u2019s Up, from producers including Shonda Rhimes, Ryan Murphy, Ava DuVernay and Judd Apatow, to the major talent agencies.\u201cTrans people are fighting every day to be seen and accepted as human beings,\u201d says the letter. \u201cWe believe we are at an unprecedented cultural moment,\u201d it says, \u201cwhere we can ask Hollywood to use its power to improve the lives of trans people by changing America\u2019s understanding about who trans people are.\u201dNot long ago, says Schofield and others, transgender people felt they had to be grateful for the mere fact that Hollywood was willing to tell their stories \u2014 albeit with non-trans stars, like Hilary Swank in the 1999 \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry,\u201d Felicity Huffman in the 2005 \u201cTransamerica,\u201d or Jared Leto in 2013\u2032s \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d (Swank and Leto won Oscars, and Huffman was nominated.)ADVERTISEMENT\u201cI don\u2019t begrudge \u2018Boys Don\u2019t Cry\u2019 anything,\u201d says Schofield, \u201cbut times have changed. We have trans people who are professionally trained artists.\u201dSome directors who\u2019ve hired trans actors note that they bring a perspective that non-trans actors can\u2019t. Dutch director Maria Peters, who hired Schofield for \u201cThe Conductor,\u201d says the pivotal role he plays required an innate understanding of both genders. \u201cI told Scott I would hire him again to play a man OR a woman,\u201d she says. She adds that in an ideal world, anybody could play anything. But, she says, \u201cTransgender actors are fed up with not having been taken seriously for so many years.\u201dBacklash was swift when Johansson announced plans last month to play the real-life character of Dante \u201cTex\u201d Gill, a trans man. She initially responded that criticism \u201ccan be directed to Jeffrey Tambor (of TV\u2019s \u201cTransparent\u201d), Jared Leto and Felicity Huffman\u2019s reps.\u201dJohansson later switched course, saying her earlier statement was insensitive. \u201cI understand why many feel (the character) should be portrayed by a transgender person, and I am thankful that this casting debate, albeit controversial, has sparked a larger conversation about diversity and representation in film,\u201d she said.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if \u201cRub & Tug,\u201d which Johansson was producing, will go forward.Just as transgender roles are compelling to actors of all orientations, so are parts involving disability, says talent agent Gail Williamson, who represents disabled actors.\u201cHollywood loves a good disability story,\u201d says Williamson, \u201cbut they like to cast it with a big star. They know that dollars come with the name \u2014 and the name wants to play it because they know awards and recognition come with it.\u201dBut what, Williamson asks, would have happened if they hadn\u2019t let Marlee Matlin audition for \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d 30 years ago?

(AP) \u2014 A former New Mexico priest who fled the U.S. decades ago amid allegations of child sex abuse will await trial behind bars, a federal judge decided Tuesday, as his accusers in the audience applauded.Defense attorney Samuel Winder argued in court that Arthur Perrault was not a flight risk as he had no passport, no family and no means of leaving the country. But prosecutors described him as a danger to the community who fled before.\u201cHe is known to manipulate and gain the trust of people,\u201d federal Prosecutor Sean Sullivan told U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen Molzen. \u201cHonestly, a jail setting is the best setting for the defendant to be.\u201dADVERTISEMENTMolzen agreed and called Perrault a \u201cvery charming man\u201d who once fled to a country that didn\u2019t have an extradition treaty with the U.S.Court documents filed late last week said victims described Perrault showering them with gifts and meals before abusing them. They also described Perrault as someone who smoked pipes and wore silk underwear.The documents said the Connecticut-born Perrault also once wrote an apology letter to the parents of one victim in 1971 and blamed his actions on cancer, which prosecutors said he was never diagnosed with.Perrault was extradited to New Mexico last week from Morocco in connection with sexual abuse cases that are said to have taken place between 1991 and 1992 at Kirtland Air Force Base and Santa Fe National Cemetery.The former Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Santa Fe and a former Air Force chaplain has been charged in a federal indictment with seven counts of aggravated sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact.Perrault pleaded not guilty in his first court appearance Friday. He also told a U.S. magistrate judge he\u2019d had a stroke three years ago, was deaf in one ear, and had trouble walking.In court Tuesday, a frail Perrault repeatedly asked a judge and lawyers to speak up and needed headphones to listen to arguments.Winder, his attorney, said he had not seen all the evidence in the case. But he cautioned that Perrault\u2019s health remained fragile. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any relatives. He can\u2019t hear very well,\u201d Winder said.Winder suggested that he may ask a federal judge to reconsider the decision to hold Perrault until his trial and instead have he assigned to a halfway house.After the detention hearing, Perrault\u2019s accusers and their families \u2014 some who were seen crying \u2014 left without talking to reporters.Perrault, a one-time pastor at St. Bernadette parish in Albuquerque, is one of many priests sent to New Mexico in the 1960s from around the country for treatment involving pedophilia.Victims, lawyers and church documents show the priests were later assigned to parishes and schools across New Mexico \u2014 especially in Native American and Hispanic communities.Perrault vanished in 1992, just days before an attorney filed two lawsuits against the archdiocese alleging Perrault had sexually assaulted seven children at his parish.The FBI said Perrault first fled to Canada and then to Tangier, Morocco, where he worked until last year at an English-language school for children.Perrault denied abusing children in a handwritten letter sent in November 2016 to a judge related to sexual abuse lawsuits in Albuquerque. Perrault said his assets included money from military retirement and Social Security.Church records released last year by a New Mexico judge show Perrault is also accused in state lawsuits of sexually abusing at least 38 boys in other cases.Records also show Perrault was sent in 1965 to Servants of the Paraclete \u2014 a religious order that ran a treatment center for pedophile priests in Jemez Springs, New Mexico \u2014 after he was accused of molesting young men while serving in Connecticut.___Follow Russell Contreras on Twitter at http://twitter.com/russcontreras"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/mlb-baseball-ohio-archive-cleveland-31ddfd4463744fd4aa59bd94844bc807", "headline": "Indians fan missed game after horrible accident, but team honors ...", "date": "2018-08-06T12:00:15Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "Indians fan missed game after horrible accident, but team honors tickets 52 years laterCLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 Jennifer Annis had been looking forward to seeing the Indians. Having earned straight A\u2019s at St. Rose School, she was awarded two tickets to the game on Aug. 20, 1966.It was a treat. Her mother was a widow with several children, so \u201cgoing to baseball games was not in the plan,\u201d she said. Her favorite players were Rocky Colavito and Vic Davalillo.The Indians faced the White Sox on what turned out to be a pleasant afternoon, the temperature reaching a comfortable 77 degrees. Fans in Cleveland saw a stellar pitching performance from Chicago\u2019s Tommy John, who hit one of his five home runs over 26 big-league seasons. He went the distance, allowing only three hits and one walk. The White Sox won, 4-1, in Cleveland Municipal Stadium.ADVERTISEMENTJennifer, though, didn\u2019t make the game.A week earlier, she rode a bike to visit a friend and waited at a train crossing on the West Side. An eastbound train passed, then she crossed. She didn\u2019t see the westbound train coming.It slammed into her, sending her 23 feet off her bike. Her friends Elizabeth Rooks and Mary Jane Torrence raced to Jennifer\u2019s home and told her younger brother Jeff what happened.\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d came the response. The he realized they were serious.She suffered a fractured skull and broke 13 bones in her arms. She spent four weeks in the hospital. The effect of the injuries would linger the rest of her life. She would lose much of her hearing and would not remember anything that happened on Aug. 13, 1966. It remains a lost day.But she kept the tickets. And thanks to a whimsical decision, she would see a game in Cleveland because of them.The 11-year-old \u2013 now 63-year-old Jennifer Wells living in Juno Beach, Florida \u2013 visited Cleveland for the first time in years and brought the tickets with her.The Indians, 52 years later, honored them.This week, Wells recalled the moments leading to the accident and how she got to Cleveland.\u201cIt was early Saturday morning,\u201d she said. \u201cI was on my way to see my friend Elizabeth. My mom had taken me shopping the night before. ... I had new clothes, and I was going to show my friend the new clothes.\u201cThere were two houses on the other side of the tracks\u201d near 112th Street and Detroit Avenue, she said. \u201cThere was this woman living in the house next to the tracks, and she saw me get hit. First she called the priest, then she called the ambulance. The priest came down and gave my last rites. The ambulance came ... and they had to pull the train apart to get to me.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cPeople were not very happy. They had to wait so long for the train. Nobody knew. If you were on 117th Street, the train stopped (traffic) for a long time. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t know some little girl got hit.\u201dWells\u2019 aunt, uncle and cousins had left that day on vacation, but heard the news on the radio and turned around.Wells spent her 12th birthday in the hospital.\u201cI asked my mom \u2018How come they didn\u2019t put casts on my arms?\u2019 \u201d\u2033 \u2018They thought you were going to die\u2019 \u201d came the reply.\u201cThey put blood in me. That\u2019s what saved me. All my veins were collapsed, but they cut open my ankles and put blood in there. I don\u2019t understand that, but that\u2019s what they did.\u201dThen the day came for her to go home, and she showed a persistence that would stay with her later in life.\u201cThey came with a wheelchair. I said \u2018I\u2019m not going to ride in that wheelchair. I\u2019m walking out of here.\u2019 And I did. My legs were not broken.\u201dShe would graduate from Lakewood High School in 1972 and Keuka College in New York, and go on to receive advanced degrees. She is an occupational therapist.Because of the injuries she lost most of her hearing, she said. A few years ago she received a Cochlear implant in her left ear and a hearing aid in her right.\u201cI\u2019m a bionic woman,\u201d she said.It was only recently that the idea to visit Cleveland came about.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a plan to go to Cleveland,\u201d she said. \u201cI only had a couple cousins and the one aunt in Ohio. My mom and brother live down here in Florida and my son. And I just never think of going up there. I\u2019m in a running club. One of the guys in the running club who I barely know said \u2018I\u2019m from Cleveland. I\u2019m going to go up and visit and have my friends get on the Goodtime III.\u2019 I said \u2018That sounds like fun.\u2019 \u201dShe brought her tickets along with that persistence she found as a 12-year-old.\u201cI went to the stadium,\u201d Wells said. \u201cI wanted to go to the Saturday game (July 7, vs. Oakland). I asked a security guard - I had these old tickets and wanted to exchange them. He sneered and said \u2018Go to the box office.\u2019 \u201dShe met a box-office attendant who was kind but said he didn\u2019t have authority to exchange the tickets. She found her way to the executive offices, where one person thought they were stubs. She convinced him they were genuine. Other staffers checked them out. Finally, she said, Estee Arend from Fan Services told her \u2018This is terrific. We\u2019re going to give you a ticket.\u2019The Indians actually gave her two additional tickets for her aunt and cousin. The original tickets were for upper-reserved seats and worth $2.50 each. They came with a letter signed by Indians president Game Paul and Cleveland Press sports editor Regis McAuley.\u201cIt was so terrific,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just the most exciting day for me. And then they brought some gifts to me. They gave me a bobblehead and a Cleveland Indians bag and a rally rag.It was just a great day. I wish they had won, though.\u201d (The Indians lost, 6-3.)For Wells, it was a bit of closure to an empty memory more than half a century ago. \u201cI did everything I wanted to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI had such a great time in Ohio and Cleveland.\u201d\n"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/soccer-sports-europe-samara-sports-europe-97aa7c6f8e53484db7cb7ca5966a3348", "headline": "World Cup: No Russian?

They have used the mobile app version to order food, change money and meet new people, especially in cities like Samara, where most people only speak Russian.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cGoogle Translate has been a fundamental tool,\u201d Garcia said, wearing the red jersey of Costa Rica\u2019s national team.\u201cIn a country where people are going out of their way to try to understand us, it\u2019s key,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought there was going to be a language barrier, but it wasn\u2019t like that.\u201dBefore hundreds of thousands of fans descended on Russia, many of them studied phrases or took lessons to learn the basics of the language and the Cyrillic alphabet in time for the tournament that kicked off on June 14.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard, My partner has been learning a little bit of Russian, but other than that we use Google Translate,\u201d said Ruth Morris from Queensland, Australia. She who wore a yellow t-shirt in the colors of the national team emblazoned with green kangaroos that read: \u201cAussie, Aussie Aussie! Oi, Oi, Oi!\u201dThe day that she arrived to Moscow with her husband, they struck up conversation with a group of local residents at a bar.\u201cWe managed to communicate and make friends using a mix of Google Translate, sign language and - piba!\u201d Brian Mckinley said, using the Russian word for beer.These days, one scene has been repeated thousands of times in cities across Russia: A person types a sentence on a phone or taps into the microphone and waits until the other one reads it or hears the words, nods, and responds.\u201cIn many ways Google Translate is remarkable. If your intent is to have basic straightforward communication, then Google Translate can serve you adequately,\u201d said Andrew Cohen, professor emeritus in second language studies from the University of Minnesota.Cohen has been using Google translate to assist him with Mandarin Chinese, his 13th language. But he said the offerings are sometimes wrong.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThere are several reasons for this: One is that GT does not have a brain and so it really cannot deal effectively with connotations of word meanings, nor with various collocations of words with other words,\u201d he said. Then, there\u2019s the issue of pragmatics, since it can\u2019t interpret the intentions of the person trying to communicate.It \u201cmay have considerable difficulty translating humor, sarcasm, subtle forms of criticism, curses, apologies so that they work, even requests in a way that they are appropriately mitigated rather than bossy sounding,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is where Google Translate still has lots of work to do.\u201dTranslate was launched in 2006 and has grown into one of Google\u2019s most popular services with more than 500 million monthly users and more than 100 billion words translated each day, according to the company. Russian is one of the most used out of more than 100 languages that range from Afrikaans to Yiddish. They can be used on websites, with speech recognition and as an app on mobile phones, even if there is no connection. Others use one of its features to recognize and translate the writing on billboards, menus and street signs.\u201cThe Russian Cyrillic is unlike any word in our alphabet,\u201d said Marilyn Mattos, 30, a Colombian fan who wore earrings in the yellow, blue and red colors of the national flag.\u201cBut we used Google Translator to take pictures, select the text and translate it into Spanish without a problem.\u201dIt has even been used to break the ice between journalists and players. During a recent press conference with Antoine Griezmann that only allowed questions in French, a Spanish journalist put the microphone on his phone and used Google Translate to ask, drawing a wide grin from the French striker who plays professionally in Madrid and speaks Spanish.And it has also been used for safety tips to reduce accidents. Marat Gurjan, a 15-year-old lifeguard whose favorite player is Neymar, uses the app to help communicate on a Volga River beach.\u201cThe World Cup is a great honor,\u201d the screen on his phone read in English after he typed a sentence in Russian. \u201cFor our country, and especially for Samara.\u201d___More AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/WorldCup", "date": "2018-06-19T15:24:58Z"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/north-america-us-news-ap-top-news-john-kasich-oh-state-wire-dad28c9132924d1d8ad7d45557ff089b", "headline": "Ohio killer spared after extent of childhood abuse revealed | AP News", "date": "2018-07-20T22:39:25Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Friday spared a condemned killer whose sentence was challenged after a juror came forward and said information about the extent of the inmate\u2019s tough childhood wasn\u2019t properly presented at trial.The Republican governor commuted the sentence of death row inmate Raymond Tibbetts to life without the possibility of parole, citing \u201cfundamental flaws\u201d in the sentencing portion of Tibbetts\u2019 trial.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cSpecifically, the defense\u2019s failure to present sufficient mitigating evidence, coupled with an inaccurate description of Tibbetts\u2019 childhood by the prosecution, essentially prevented the jury from making an informed decision about whether Tibbetts deserved the death sentence,\u201d Kasich said.The guilt of Tibbetts, 61, has never been in doubt. He received the death sentence for stabbing Fred Hicks to death at Hicks\u2019 Cincinnati home in 1997. Tibbetts also received life imprisonment for fatally beating and stabbing his wife, 42-year-old Judith Crawford, during an argument that same day over Tibbetts\u2019 crack cocaine habit.The 67-year-old Hicks had hired Crawford as a caretaker and allowed the couple to stay with him.The case against Tibbetts seemed closed until a former juror, Ross Geiger, came across materials presented on Tibbetts\u2019 behalf to the Ohio Parole Board that documented horrific facts about Tibbetts\u2019 early years, which jurors never heard.When Tibbetts was a boy, he and his brothers were tied to a single bed at night, were not fed properly, were thrown down stairs, had their fingers beaten with spatulas and were burned on heating registers, according to Tibbetts\u2019 application for mercy last year.Geiger wrote Kasich in January citing his concerns and asking that Tibbetts be spared. He also testified before the parole board last month in a rare follow-up clemency hearing. The board had voted 11-1 against mercy for Tibbetts last year.Geiger told the board that Tibbetts\u2019 upbringing was presented as a debate between his attorneys, who said his background was terrible, and prosecutors, who said it wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201cI was just struck and frankly upset that information that was available was not even addressed, other than in very summary fashion,\u201d Geiger told the board.Geiger\u2019s comments didn\u2019t sway the panel, which again recommended against mercy for Tibbetts with an 8-1 vote.Kasich\u2019s decision Friday rejected that ruling.ADVERTISEMENTGeiger said Friday he appreciated that the governor considered his concerns about what he saw as a failure of the system. \u201cThe truth is what matters the most so that you can avoid a circumstance like this,\u201d he told The Associated Press in a phone interview.Geiger also expressed his \u201cutmost respect\u201d for the families of Tibbetts\u2019 victims, saying they\u2019ve had to endure 20 years of uncertainty.Erin Barnhart, a federal public defender representing Tibbetts, said Kasich performed the state a great service in sparing the inmate.County prosecutors have previously argued that Tibbetts\u2019 background does not outweigh his crimes. That includes stabbing Crawford after he had already beaten her to death, and then repeatedly stabbing Hicks, a \u201csick, defenseless, hearing-impaired man in whose home Tibbetts lived,\u201d they told the parole board.Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters said Friday that Kasich, a fellow Republican, exercised his right as governor.\u201cWe do not have to agree with it but he is the governor and it is over,\u201d Deters said.Also Friday, Kasich delayed the September execution of condemned killer Cleveland Jackson until May 2019 after the inmate\u2019s former attorneys stopped working on the case, according to the governor.Jackson was sentenced to die for the 2002 shooting of a 17-year-old girl in Lima during a robbery.___Andrew Welsh-Huggins can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/awhcolumbus.___This story has been corrected to say the case against Tibbetts, not Hicks, seemed closed until a juror came across materials presented to the parole board."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/santo-domingo-caribbean-dominican-republic-latin-america-international-news-6c5c0d2a21ce448797b341bbe76d806f", "headline": "High-tech backpacks open world of whales to deaf students | AP News", "date": "2017-03-17T04:49:11Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "SAMANA, Dominican Republic (AP) \u2014 Every winter, whale-watching excursions take tourists to ride alongside humpbacks frolicking in the Caribbean. One voyage this week pursued whales for their mysterious, multi-octave songs, but with passengers who didn\u2019t hear the grunting and squealing.The dozens of deaf students wore high-tech backpacks that turn whale songs into vibrations, opening the world of whales to children who gasped and marveled at feeling the sounds for the first time.\u201cWhen I first felt the vibration, I felt it in my heart,\u201d said Nicole Duran, 15, a student at the St. Rose Institute for Deaf Assistance in Santo Domingo. \u201cIt reminded me of a heartbeat,\u201d she said through a sign language interpreter.Nicole was among 47 students on the field trip from Santo Domingo, the capital on the south coast, to Samana province on the north coast, a three-hour bus ride.ADVERTISEMENTIn grades 7 through 12, the children used their hands to express the thumps, pings and gentle massage they felt on their skin. Stretching their arms high and low to follow the varying tones they sensed, the students opened and closed their hands rapidly to express strong impacts.\u201cI feel the pulses \u2014 it\u2019s like boom, boom, boom!\u201d Melissa Castillos, 18, said aboard a 48-foot, power catamaran in the Bay of Samana. \u201cI\u2019ve seen photos and videos of whales, but this is the real thing.\u201dThe migration of several thousand humpbacks from the northern Gulf of Maine to the Dominican coast brings some 50,000 tourists to the area from January through March annually, the Tourism Ministry says. For three consecutive years, the visitors have included children and teachers from several Dominican schools.Introducing deaf and hearing-impaired students to the whales and their music was the vision of Dominican artist and musician Maria Batlle, 34, who in 2013 founded the Muse Seek Project. Her nonprofit\u2019s goals include using music as an educational tool for deaf children.Batlle said she learned in 2014 of the Subpac technology, developed for music producers and aficionados by a Los Angeles company, and a year later incorporated the devices into a music program she launched for the 500-student National School for the Deaf in Santo Domingo.The annual whale migration to the Dominican Republic made it a natural learning opportunity for students interested in marine life, Batlle said.\u201cThey learn about whale behavior, anatomy, the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cThey learn why the whales come here, what they do when they\u2019re here. They learn to appreciate why whale watching is important and why whale hunting should stop.\u201dPassengers aboard this year\u2019s voyage included teachers, students and guests from four academic institutions. Eric Quinlan, originally from Brockton, Massachusetts, and teacher of English and sign language at the 200-student St. Rose school, served as interpreter for the deaf passengers.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cBeing deaf, the students are never really going to know what sound is, but to experience it this way is just awesome,\u201d Quinlan said as the boat trailed a pod of six adult whales through choppy waters.Quinlan also interpreted in February when Batlle took 40 deaf students to see the hit musical \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Instead of high-tech gear, each child held a simple balloon, which vibrated to the music and dialogue. It was the first sign-language interpretation at a Dominican cinema, Batlle said.In 2016, ornithologist Richard Prum, a hearing-impaired professor at Yale University, lectured deaf students about birds and their melodies in another blending of education and music, Batlle added. And just for fun in 2016, she organized a beachfront silent disco, where deaf students danced to the rhythms they felt through the wearable technology.In another first for deaf services, the Popular Savings and Loan Association, a Muse Seek partner, has a bilingual (Spanish-sign language) employee in each branch, Batlle said.While the whale excursions in 2015 and 2016 picked up clear melodies from the humpbacks, the hydrophone lowered from the boat Tuesday mostly transmitted the static of rough seas. Ready with Plan B, Batlle used a recording of last year\u2019s robust melodies instead.Reveling in the sight of humpbacks and the pulses of last year\u2019s songs, the students expressed sheer delight.\u201cHow emotional, how beautiful,\u201d David Montero, 17, said through animated signing. \u201cThis is my first time in Samana, the first time I ever saw a whale, and to know they sing \u2014 wow!

A second officer who shot Sanchez with a Taser, Lt. Matt Lindsey, also acted justifiably because of the potential threat to the officers\u2019 lives, Prater said.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cAt the moment Officer Barnes discharged his pistol he was acting in self-defense and, in my opinion, had no other reasonable option to prevent Mr. Sanchez from seriously injuring or killing him,\u201d Prater said. \u201cBoth officers employed techniques in an attempt to de-escalate and bring the situation to a peaceful ending. It is due to no fault of the officers that the matter ended violently.\u201dBoth Barnes and Lindsey tried to render aid to Sanchez immediately after the shooting, Prater said.Police have said officers who responded to a hit-and-run crash encountered Sanchez holding a metal pipe. An autopsy report shows Sanchez was hit with a stun gun and shot five times in the chest, pelvis and upper arm.Police have said previously that witnesses yelled \u201che can\u2019t hear you\u201d before the officers fired, but that the officers didn\u2019t hear them. Prater suggested Friday that the fact Sanchez was deaf was not the reason he was killed, noting that both officers were in uniform, were driving in clearly marked patrol cars with emergency lights activated and were signaling to Sanchez to put down the weapon.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hear to know what these officers are telling you,\u201d Prater said.The shooting prompted protests from activists from groups including Black Lives Matter Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Association of the Deaf.Family members of Sanchez had called for Barnes\u2019 arrest and for state and federal investigations into the matter.Sanchez\u2019s family has said he was completely deaf, developmentally disabled, and that he used the pipe as a walking stick.

The state\u2019s health department has said it is developing an initiative to attract, recruit and retain home health workers.New York lawmakers have held hearings on the issue, and both the Senate and Assembly have so far included language in their budgets that would review and restructure how the state transfers Medicaid dollars to the providers, agencies and workers with the aim of providing workers and hours where they are needed most.Other states are grappling with how to address the dwindling workforce as their minimum wages climb.ADVERTISEMENTIn Maine, legislation in 2015 attempted to make personal care worker wages more competitive with specific reimbursements for worker compensation. But a popular initiative will raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020, minimizing those differences.In Arizona, minimum wage increases have been accompanied by increased reimbursement rates, and in Washington state, workers negotiated a $15 wage for some home-care workers for when the state minimum increases to $13.50 in 2020.New York advocates say a higher state minimum wage won\u2019t attract any extra workers in rural regions such as Clinton County, where Bushey lives.A single agency, North Country Home Services, hires and trains about 300 home health aides and personal care aides for about 1,000 people throughout a mountainous region the size of Connecticut. In any given week, the agency says, it leaves 400 hours of state-authorized care unfilled due to staffing shortages.The aides who continue despite the wages are a special breed, said Erica Stranahan, of Plattsburgh, who has worked as a home health aide with North Country for nine years and earns about $12 an hour. Stranahan said several of her co-workers have recently left homecare for less-intensive professions that will soon have similar wages.Stranahan acknowledged she makes it work only by sharing rent and living expenses with her boyfriend. She said she feels a responsibility to those she cares for, and would rather find a second job than quit caring for others.\u201cI enjoy helping people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re with them for so many hours. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re a second family for them,\u201d Stranahan said.But Rosalie Kline, a personal care aide in Canandaigua for nearly 13 years who also struggles to make ends meet, said that if worse came to worst, she would find another job that paid more.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to. I love my job,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I might need to.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/archive-ae5bf04f65c44fc1a35b8a9e49c1eb6c", "headline": "#7.

They also put some cotton balls in their ears to experience what it might be like to not hear clearly.The Autism and communications disability table focused on teaching students on the difficulties some students have with their senses and with communicating. One activity included wearing headphones that had a lot of voices and noises going on while trying to have a conversation with a friend. Since the senses can be problematic, students had to wear a small piece of sandpaper behind their neck to know how much something like a t-shirt tag my bother someone.Another way students learned at the communications table was to have to learn to try and communicate with only pictures.

Wise, who represents the Florida-based Nonhuman Rights Project animal advocacy group, argued that two chimps named Tommy and Kiko should be freed from cages to live in a mammoth-sized outdoor sanctuary in Florida.The Boston lawyer has been trying for years, unsuccessfully, to get courts to grant the New York chimps habeas corpus in order to, he says, free them from unlawful imprisonment.He says that if the judges agree, the apes \u2014 which didn\u2019t appear in court \u2014 would be sent to live with others of their species on one of 13 islands amid a lake in Fort Pierce, Florida, that comprise the Save the Chimps sanctuary.A five-judge panel will issue its ruling in the coming days or weeks.Kiko\u2019s keeper, Carmen Presti, says he\u2019s not giving him up.He and his wife rescued the deaf chimp 23 years ago from a life of performing at state fairs and in the television movie \u201cTarzan in Manhattan.\u201d Kiko is believed to have lost his hearing when he was beaten by a trainer, and has medical problems requiring constant attention.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cIf he\u2019s taken away, he could die without his family to give him the special care he needs, and to bring him into the house to play,\u201d says Presti, of Niagara Falls, New York, where he runs the nonprofit Primate Sanctuary, whose rescue animals are part of a youth educational program.Tommy was caged at a trailer lot in Gloversville, outside Albany.His keeper, Patrick Lavery, calls the various lawsuits \u201ca ridiculous thing.\u201d He told The Associated Press that he had temporarily cared for Tommy to spare him from being euthanized, then donated him to an out-of-state facility in September 2015.Wise\u2019s Coral Springs, Florida-based Nonhuman Rights Project has a history of litigation over chimps that started in 2013, when a lawsuit on behalf of Kiko was first filed in state Supreme Court in Niagara Falls and in Fulton County on behalf of Tommy. The same year, another suit named Hercules and Leo \u2014 chimps being used for anatomical research at Stony Brook University on Long Island. They\u2019re now at a Louisiana research facility, Wise says.In 2014, an Albany appellate court ruled that Tommy was not legally a person because chimps cannot have duties and responsibilities. In a court brief, primate pioneer Jane Goodall countered by saying chimps do carry out duties and responsibilities in animal family settings and that apes have complex cognitive abilities allowing them to make choices.However, legal personhood does not mean animals are expected to perform daily human tasks. It\u2019s a technical term that ensures legal entities \u2014 in this case, chimps \u2014 have basic rights.Presti is not taking any direct legal action, but does have his own view of the latest case.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cAlbert Einstein said insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results,\u201d Presti said in a telephone interview, with a chuckle.On Thursday, the judges peppered the attorney with questions: Why does he persist in filing lawsuits and challenging so many court decisions? Is there a precedent in the U.S. for making a chimp a \u201clegal person?\u201d (apparently not) Or does one have to practically create a new law for that purpose? Does habeas corpus mean moving chimps from one facility to another, or just giving them what Wise calls \u201cabsolute freedom\u201d? (In that case, he said later tongue-in-cheek, they could end up, say, in Times Square and get killed.)\u201cAll of our arguments are really grounded on fundamental ideas of justice,\u201d Wise said after the 15-minute court session. \u201cThe reasons that humans should have rights are the reasons that nonhumans should have rights.\u201dHe remains doggedly hopeful \u2014 especially after an Argentinean judge ruled in November that chimps in fact have habeas corpus rights. \u201cWe will win, in the end,\u201d he said.___The Nonhuman Rights Project: https://www.nonhumanrightsproject.orgThe Primate Sanctuary: http://theprimatesanctuary.com____Follow Verena Dobnik on Twitter at https://twitter.com/VerenaChirps"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/business-santa-fe-roswell-new-mexico-higher-education-7d42db51e3c545ac921bfa7eba031c53", "headline": "Higher ed veto nixes nearly $3B in funding | AP News", "date": "2017-04-20T04:57:12Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "The breadth of Gov. Susana Martinez\u2019s veto earlier this month of New Mexico\u2019s higher education budget was more far reaching than previously understood, totaling nearly $3 billion, according to a close examination of her markups of House Bill 2, the legislation that would fund state government for the fiscal year that begins July 1.While much of the attention to Martinez\u2019s budget vetoes has focused on her decision to withhold money to colleges and universities, and to the operation of the Legislature, her line-item markups also eliminated funds for a wide range of programs and services that fall under colleges \u2014 including hospitals, agricultural extension offices, the agency that performs autopsies for police and a hotline for poisoning victims.Martinez also struck funding for the New Mexico School for the Deaf in Santa Fe, the state\u2019s School for the Blind and Visually Impaired in Alamogordo and the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, which enrolls students from ninth grade through the first two years of college.ADVERTISEMENTEarlier this week, Martinez, a Republican, said she expects to come to an agreement with the Democrat-controlled Legislature to restore the higher education funds, but legislative leaders said Wednesday that little progress on such a deal has been made.\u201cThe governor\u2019s action, trying to be fancy with her vetoes, has created the mess we\u2019re in,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe, said in an interview. \u201cThis would impact the state in a multitude of ways. Students, families and businesses would be hurt. She\u2019s created a constitutional crisis.\u201dHouse Speaker Brian Egolf, also a Santa Fe Democrat, said, \u201cThe sad part here is that if there was no budget at all, if she\u2019d vetoed the whole bill, last year\u2019s budget would be in place.\u201dBecause the new appropriations bill was signed into law, it\u2019s possible that the entire higher education system and all the programs under it will go unfunded unless Martinez and the Legislature come to an agreement before July 1 \u2014 or the state Supreme Court overturns her vetoes.Egolf said late last week that the Legislature will file a petition requesting a Supreme Court hearing on the legislative funds that Martinez vetoed. A similar legal filing dealing with the higher education funds will shortly follow, he said.Martinez met with Wirth and Egolf last week to try to come to an agreement on the budget. Both legislators said they asked the governor to show them her own budget plan. \u201cSo far, she hasn\u2019t done that,\u201d Egolf said.The major sticking point in the budget package that passed the Legislature in March was $350 million in revenue generated by some new taxes and fees and by closing some loopholes in existing tax laws. The governor vetoed the entire bill.\u201cShe\u2019s been acting as if this was an all-or-nothing proposition,\u201d Wirth said. \u201cBut we gave her a menu of items she could choose from and veto the parts she didn\u2019t like.\u201dADVERTISEMENTMartinez has said she will call a special session in the near future to address the budget, but she will wait until an agreement with lawmakers is in place. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are considering calling an extraordinary session, in which the Legislature, not the governor, would set its own agenda.It\u2019s not clear whether they have enough votes \u2014 a three-fifths majority in each chamber \u2014 necessary to do that.In taking her pen to the higher education budget, Martinez eliminated not only $779 million from the state\u2019s general fund, but also more than $1.5 billion from other sources, including the Land Grant Permanent Fund, more than $621 million from the federal government and $55 million from other state accounts, for a total of $2.99 billion.Among the programs under the higher education budget that were vetoed:\u2022 The Office of the Medical Investigator, which is part of The University of New Mexico.\u2022 UNM\u2019s Health Sciences Center, which includes the UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center, Carrie Tingley Hospital and children\u2019s psychiatric hospitals, as well as the newborn intensive care unit at UNM Hospital.\u2022 The New Mexico Poison and Drug Information Center, a 24-hour hotline for people who think they might have been poisoned. That\u2019s part of UNM\u2019s College of Pharmacy.\u2022 The Department of Agriculture\u2019s Cooperative Extension Offices, which are located in every county in the state. This program is part of New Mexico State University\u2019s budget.\u2022 The Speech and Hearing Center at NMSU.\u2022 The state\u2019s Small Business Development Centers, which are funded through Santa Fe Community College.State Rep. Bill McCamley, D-Las Cruces, said in an opinion piece in The New Mexican Wednesday that the higher education veto included community colleges that offer \u201ctechnical programs for well-paid, steady careers like commercial truck drivers, welders and X-ray techs. \u2026\u201cSusana Martinez\u2019s choice will impact the local economy of every community with a college or university,\u201d McCamley continued. \u201c\u2026 Her decision will devastate any community (Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Hobbs, Clovis, Farmington, Portales, Carlsbad, Ruidoso, Socorro, Roswell, etc.) with a college or university.\u201dContact Steve Terrell at 505-986-3037 or sterrell@sfnewmexican.com.

The point was, don\u2019t show up.\u201dButler, polite and soft-spoken, is continuing to pursue a career \u201cwherever the opportunity is.\u201d She said she thinks the agency could have used more empathy and that somebody from management should have spoken to her \u201cface to face\u201d about the mistake. She said she hopes that speaking out can help prevent the same thing from happening to others.\u201cI do not expect to get a job unfairly,\u201d Butler said in an email. \u201cThe issue is the state\u2019s lack of organization, even when there are checks and balances that should trigger the realization that an error is underway.\u201dDepartment of Social Services spokesman David Dearborn declined to comment. Butler contacted state Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, who told Butler Friday afternoon that she had spoken to Social Services Commissioner Roderick L. Bremby, who is looking into the matter.Butler has a bachelor\u2019s degree in liberal studies from Southern Connecticut State University, with minors in public health, interpersonal and relational communication and psychology. She said she has taken a year\u2019s worth of courses toward a master\u2019s degree in human resources, but put it on pause due to financial reasons.After applying for about a hundred jobs in Connecticut, Butler said she decided to try her luck in Florida and moved there in March 2017.\u201cI need a career,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not getting younger. I took the leap. If it\u2019s not going to happen in Connecticut, maybe it will happen in Florida.\u201dShe has been working at part-time and temporary jobs in the Sunshine State, most recently working as a receptionist at an architectural firm, working at a pizza place and doing captioning for the deaf/hearing impaired. She said she lived with a roommate to afford housing.ADVERTISEMENTButler received an email from the Department of Social Services on Oct. 12, asking her if she was interested in a one-year training position that would, if completed successfully, lead to a permanent position as an eligibility services worker.She followed up the next day with a phone call, during which she said Kelly Geary, a DSS human resource specialist, offered her the job. She received an offer letter from Geary, dated Oct. 13, confirming her acceptance of the position with the department\u2019s Manchester office. It laid out her work schedule and salary \u2014 44,000 a year \u2014 and instructed her to show up at the department\u2019s central office for orientation on Oct. 27.\u201cAgain, welcome to the Department of Social Services and congratulations,\u201d said the last paragraph of the letter. \u201cI am confident that your assignment with the agency will be both challenging and rewarding.\u201dButler packed, raised money for a deposit on an apartment and headed north.\u201cThe only reason I came back is that it was a state job, and I would be silly not to take them up on the offer,\u201d she said.Butler provided the DSS with the names of references and information for a criminal background check. She has no criminal record, according to public records.She left Florida on Oct. 25, two days before her scheduled orientation. When she got the phone call en route that there was no job, her grandfather advised her to go to the orientation the next morning. She said she went and, much to her surprise, was given an employment packet with her name on it. She said she met someone with the same last name and wondered if that could have led to the mistake. She told a facilitator about the call she had received and eventually was told, \u201cYes, there is no position, because you didn\u2019t interview.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018I can interview now,\u2019\u201d Butler said. She was told no.Butler said one of her references told her somebody called and asked for a reference for somebody with a different name. When the person asked if they were calling about Butler, the caller said yes.\u201cMy reference said they attached my paperwork with someone else\u2019s,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI was told something about a mix-up and that the names were similar.\u201dButler said she was told the state would send her a formal apology letter and she was welcome to apply for other openings.On Thursday, she received via email a letter from Geary, the human resource specialist, dated Oct. 27, that said Butler hadn\u2019t had an interview and that her application had \u201cmissing components.\u201dButler said she was unaware of any \u201cmissing components\u201d besides an interview.k.florin@theday.com"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/health-omaha-hastings-fe61c098c60e405db8b235259f20a217", "headline": "The Good Life: Cousins find great-great-grandma's grave in ...", "date": "2017-12-17T08:38:24Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "HASTINGS, Neb. \u2014 For decades, only a small brick engraved with the number \u201c1685\u201d marked a grave in the far corner of a grassy field that sits on the outskirts of town.Over the decades, thick sod had overgrown the brick, obscuring the resting place of a patient who died at a place called the Hospital for the Incurably Insane.The grave, and its story, might have been forgotten if not for a pair of sleuthing genealogists from the Omaha area.Lisa McLaughlin and Kristin Riggle were researching their family\u2019s history, but had hit a dead end when it came to the life of a great-great-grandmother named Ella Mattisdotter-Pearson.The tiny Swedish immigrant, who didn\u2019t speak English, was born around 1856.

Korea to end GPS monitoring, some checkupsAfter more digging, and navigating a slew of red tape, they found out that she was buried amid 1,150 graves, marked only by a brick with a number.That was something they could not tolerate.\u201cWe were just appalled,\u201d said Riggle, who lives in McClelland, Iowa, northeast of Council Bluffs. \u201cThese people were here on this earth. Whether they were sick or not, their memories need to recognized by their names, not a number.\u201dOn Dec. 9, Riggle and McLaughlin drove to Hastings, dug into the turf and replaced Pearson\u2019s numbered brick with a headstone.It reads \u201cRemembered with Love.\u201dA dozen graves are marked with simple white crosses, but this was the first headstone placed at the cemetery, located at the end of a narrow dirt road behind the facility, now called the Hastings Regional Center.\u201cWe found her and she\u2019s never going to be forgotten now,\u201d said McLaughlin, a substitute teacher who lives in west Omaha. \u201cEven though for a long time people wanted to forget her.\u201dThe two, who are cousins, are part of a small but growing number of people trying to right a past wrong.Nearly 2,500 patients were buried in cemeteries at the state\u2019s mental hospitals, in Hastings, Lincoln and Norfolk. The burials ended in 1957, but each grave was marked only by a patient\u2019s medical ID number.Riggle called the practice \u201cinhumane.\u201d But officials said it illustrated how mental illness was regarded decades ago.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cA lot of families, a lot of patients, due to the stigma of those days, didn\u2019t want people to know they were there,\u201d said Marj Colburn, an administrator at the Hastings center.Some patients used fake names, Colburn said. Some believed that mental illness was connected to witchcraft. Traumatic brain injuries, migraine headaches and even senility were lumped together as mental illness.The public still has a way to go in openly discussing mental illness, said Sheri Dawson, who directs the behavioral health division of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.\u201cIt affects one in four of us,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cWe need to raise the conversation.\u201dToday\u2019s medications and treatments can be effective, she said. Mental illness should not be considered a secret, but a treatable, chronic illness, Dawson said.Some things are changing, particularly when it comes to recognizing the patients who lived at the state\u2019s mental hospitals.In 2009 the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that families did not have to undertake an expensive legal battle to obtain information \u2014 then considered private \u2014 about ancestors who were patients at such state facilities.The ruling was hailed as \u201ca great victory for human rights,\u201d and it eased the process of discovering whether a loved one had been buried in the nondescript graves.In Lincoln there are now 14 headstones marking graves at two cemeteries used by the Lincoln Regional Center, where there are about 700 graves.While the tombstone placed in Hastings was the first there, Riggle and McLaughlin hope that other families follow their lead.Learning about the life of Ella Pearson, they said, helped them better understand their family history, as well as society\u2019s struggle with recognizing, and treating, those with mental illnesses.\u201cWe have a long way to go,\u201d Riggle said. \u201cWe need better health care in this country.\u201dMcLaughlin said that they learned that their great-great-grandmother, a small woman, perhaps 90 pounds, suffered from what was called \u201cchronic mania\u201d and was listed as refusing treatment. She worked buffing floors at the mental hospital, spending 25 years there until her death in July 1928.\u201cThe minute we saw the brick with her number, we decided we needed to get a headstone,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cWe\u2019re just so glad that we found her.\u201dpaul.hammel@owh.com, 402-473-9584"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/1292330137", "headline": "Larry Lage | AP News", "date": "2017-09-21T14:51:00Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "Larry Lage has been a sports writer for The Associated Press since 2000, winning two Beat of the Week awards recognizing the AP\u2019s top journalism of the week.

There\u2019s a good chance he\u2019d be wearing a flannel and blue jeans \u2014 a uniform typical of a Midwestern contractor \u2014 and would give a \u201cHow do you do?\u201d head nod.But beneath the surface, Haynes is suffering from a disorder so intolerable it is sometimes referred to as \u201cthe suicide disease.\u201d The condition is called trigeminal neuralgia, and it\u2019s said to cause the worst pain known to man.It occurs when pressure is put on the trigeminal nerve \u2014 the largest cranial nerve. This leads to extreme, sudden, excruciating facial pain in the areas where the branches of the trigeminal nerve are distributed \u2014 lips, eyes, nose, scalp, forehead and upper and lower jaw.ADVERTISEMENTThose with the disorder say it is so tortuous it drives them to their knees. They have described it like being slashed with razor blades. Like a searing hot knife ripping through your jaw; being constantly jabbed with a cattle prod; or like you\u2019re face is on fire. And once an attack starts, there\u2019s nothing you can do but endure it, which is why some take their own lives. They see it as the only way to end the pain. This September marked six years since Haynes was diagnosed. \u201cYou can\u2019t see it. You can\u2019t tell it\u2019s there until you live with it,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cIt\u2019s a life-changing, debilitating disease, and you wouldn\u2019t want your worst of the worst enemies to have it. ... And I don\u2019t have it nearly as bad as a lot of people that have it.\u201dAccording to the Facial Pain Association, it happens when the lining of the trigeminal nerve wears down and comes into contact with a normal blood vessel \u2014 such as an artery or vein. This puts pressure on the trigeminal nerve, causing it to induce pain. For Haynes, the nerves affected are in the lower area of the right side of his face.\u201cWhen an attack actually happens, it feels like you\u2019ve been placed into an electric chair for about five minutes. It feels like your face is being scraped off, acid being thrown on it, and it\u2019s a burning, searing sensation that will travel on my whole right side,\u201d said Haynes, of Kankakee. \u201cAnd if the attacks are severe enough, it feels like it goes all the way down to my right leg. I would swear I was on fire.\u201d Haynes said attacks are sporadic and can be set off by any number of things: shaving, using a Q-tip, brushing his hair or teeth, blowing his nose, smiling too much, scratching, even yawning. The cold weather presents a whole new set of problems. If the air is below 40 degrees, a breeze can set off an attack. He\u2019s stopped whistling and can\u2019t kiss his wife, Patti, goodbye each morning before going to work for fear it could spark an attack. Haynes experiences one every three or four weeks. They can last anywhere from a minute to hours. But many with TN feel an almost constant sensation throughout the day \u2014 that of an ice pick jabbing into the side of the face. Compared to a full-blown attack, Haynes said, it\u2019s nothing. Haynes said eating is one of the biggest difficulties. One night, it took him two hours to get halfway through a piece of chicken breast. Those with TN often suffer from malnutrition and dental disease because they do whatever it takes to avoid the onset of pain. Since being diagnosed, Haynes, who\u2019s always been slender, has dropped 25 pounds. \u201cEating my meals most of the time, I\u2019ve learned to take tiny bites and just swallow them. There\u2019s no chewing. Most people chew kind of oblong; I have to try to go completely up and down without going side to side,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cStruggling with that and to evade the pain triggers, you\u2019re totally exhausted after it\u2019s all done. It felt like I\u2019d worked all day long.\u201dADVERTISEMENTIn the first year and a half with the condition, Haynes hardly ever ate outside his own home. He wouldn\u2019t visit friends out of fear of them seeing him have an attack. He said his wife is the only person who has seen him have one, and it\u2019s so hard for her to watch she often breaks down and cries.\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying to watch,\u201d he said.And when one strikes, all he can do is grab whatever he can and grip with all his might.\u2018I remember the look on her face\u2019Trigeminal neuralgia is incredibly rare. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 12 in 100,000 people are diagnosed each year.Most people with TN first see a dentist because they believe it\u2019s tooth pain. Haynes had two root canals before being diagnosed. The condition is not detectable and cannot be diagnosed with any test. Doctors have to just go off of what symptoms the patient communicates.It was a long six months before doctors figured out what was going on with Haynes. When a doctor finally told him he suffered from trigeminal neuralgia, he remembers feeling ecstatic \u2014 finally a diagnosis. \u201cBut I remember the look on her face,\u201d he recalled. That\u2019s when she explained the condition and the long road ahead of him.For those suffering from TN, there is no cure. Haynes takes anti-seizure drugs, used to block nerve firing, which can make attacks less frequent but don\u2019t completely take away the pain. Over time, drugs may also stop working.There are several surgeries that can be done, from damaging nerve fibers or even the trigeminal nerve itself to block the pain, to microvascular decompression, which involves opening the skull behind the ear, moving the artery compressing the trigeminal nerve and cushioning it with Teflon felt. Some patients have found relief, but none of the surgeries guarantee wellness. Sometimes, they actually can worsen the condition, which is why Haynes elects not to have surgery.\u201cI don\u2019t know if the cure is better than the actual disease because one way or another, whatever I do, I have to live with the side effects for the rest of my life,\u201d he said.Searching for a cureHaynes still continues to work as a contractor, though he has allowed one of his sons to take the lead of the family business. He leaves much of the roof work to his crew since an attack could cause him to fall. He said sometimes people mistakenly believe him to be drunk on the job because the pain can cause slurred speech. That\u2019s when he has to explain what\u2019s going on.Haynes said there are good days and bad days. He was relieved when they canceled cable TV. His wife loves to cook and often had the Food Network on. Haynes began feeling angry and resentful watching people take a big bite into a juicy hamburger when it scares him to eat, fearing it will set off an attack.Since free time leads him to dwell on the pain, he volunteers to do sign language for the deaf.\u201cI joined the sign language group about six years ago, and at first it was easier to talk with my hands,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cBut sign language is so facial \u2014 only 30 percent is hand movement \u2014 but I still do it, and I actually teach the Bible to the deaf using their language. And I know what I\u2019ve learned from the scriptures is that there is hope for the future.\u201dHaynes said a friend in Minnesota with TN joined a support group, and of the 10, two of them committed suicide in the past four months.Cindy Ezell, a former Facial Pain Association board member who is diagnosed with TN herself, said the condition does not have to end in suicide \u2014 despite its reputation. The perception that most people can\u2019t live with the disorder is discouraging and only gives them a grim outlook.\u201cA lot of these people [who have committed suicide] have another underlying issue,\u201d Ezell explained. \u201cA lot of times chronic pain will cause depression because the pain can be so bad.\u201dSuicide never has been an option for Hayes. Through religion, family and friends, he remains optimistic for the future. He\u2019s gotten over his fear of visiting with friends and is relieved those close to him have done their research to understand TN, rather than fear it.\u201cUltimately, yeah, I wish there was a cure now, not just for myself,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cI can tolerate it; I can deal with it. I have the support of my friends and family, and they encourage me that there will be a time where I don\u2019t have to deal with this anymore.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/f8b4e20ff70e4f4cb591702e1f8d6d3a", "headline": "Illinois House approves new stopgap budget plan | AP News", "date": "2017-04-07T00:10:20Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) \u2014 The Illinois House voted Thursday to tap $817 million in accumulated but unallocated revenue to temporarily relieve struggling universities and human services.The 64-45 vote largely represented a largely partisan roll-call, with minority Republicans saying that another temporary spending plan amid the nation\u2019s longest state budget stalemate since World War II would actually hurt long-term efforts.The vote ended a two-hour debate over just a small amount of funding in a plan the Senate can\u2019t even consider until after the General Assembly returns from a two-week spring break. Even then its chances don\u2019t look good because Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner says he opposes it.Rep. Greg Harris of Chicago, the Democrat\u2019s point on budget matters, proposed taking money generated by income tax returns that\u2019s funneled into special accounts for education and human services. It can\u2019t be spent without legislative authorization.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThere is money sitting around, sitting in bank accounts being unspent,\u201d said Rep. Will Guzzardi, a Chicago Democrat. \u201cIf we let this bill die, we\u2019re saying we just want this money to keep accumulating in a pile while our agencies suffer.\u201dIn all, $559 million would go to the state\u2019s cash-starved universities, one of the hardest hit areas of state finance in the two years since Rauner and Democratic leaders of the General Assembly began a stalemate over an annual spending plan.Another $258 million would go to human services that have not been funded by court orders, including domestic violence programs that haven\u2019t received any money for a year, immigrant services, research into sickle cell anemia, autism and epilepsy programs, and in-home care for seniors who would otherwise have to be institutionalized.Republicans argued that approval relieves the pressure on lawmakers to find a permanent solution while debts grow.\u201cYou can go home and feel good about this vote,\u201d said the GOP floor leader, Rep. Steve Andersson of Geneva. \u201cBut think about the people you\u2019re leaving out, \u2019cause you\u2019re leaving out a lot.\u201dAndersson ticked off $10 million in proposed spending that would go to organizations that have closed, are ineligible to receive funding because of rules violations, or spend what he said is an exorbitant amount for the results it produces. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s two high schools in Jacksonville for the deaf and visually impaired get nothing.Rauner pre-empted Thursday\u2019s vote with a campaign-like video released Wednesday.\u201cStopgap spending plans do nothing to balance the budget,\u201d Rauner said. \u201cThey don\u2019t grow jobs, they don\u2019t freeze property taxes and they don\u2019t fix our broken system.\u201d___The bill is HB109Online: https://www.ilga.gov___Contact Political Writer John O\u2019Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor .

Movies you should know aboutCLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 Filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro is known for his creature features, directing movies with weird and wonderful beasts that defy imagination.But the director often uses his visual wonders as obstacles or as plot devices to advance the story. Rarely has he thoroughly humanized one of his creatures as he does in the upcoming \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d which revolves around the bond between a mute late-night janitor and a humanoid sea creature with extraordinary healing powers.Del Toro\u2019s past movies include tales of fantasy like \u201cPan\u2019s Labyrinth,\u201d superhero features like \u201cHellboy,\u201d and even \u201cPacific Rim,\u201d an exhilarating throwback to the Japanese Kaiju movies of old.The human characters are almost always the focus of Del Toro\u2019s films, with his monsters providing challenges for his characters, or simply a visual spectacle \u2013 \u201cHellboy\u201d is arguably the exception, although the title character in that movie is unquestionably the most human of Del Toro\u2019s movie creatures.ADVERTISEMENTBut the sea creature from \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d is just as well-developed as any of his human characters, and provides the emotional crux of the movie thanks in large part to Del Toro\u2019s skillful direction and the talents of Doug Jones, who portrays the beast under layers and layers of make-up and fake scales.World News Biden threatens: No gas pipeline if Russia invades UkraineUkraine-Russia crisis: What to know about rising fear of warCanada pushes back against GOP support for COVID protestsIran nuclear talks to resume in Vienna on TuesdayThe story follows Elisa Esposito \u2013 played brilliantly by Sally Hawkins \u2013 a former orphan and cleaning lady robbed of her vocal chords by an unexplained childhood injury. Elisa works at a research facility in 1960s Baltimore, which serves as the story\u2019s backdrop.Her best friend is Giles \u2013 the movie\u2019s narrator and a closeted gay artist played by Richard Jenkins \u2013 who works for an advertising agency on a freelance basis, but is in danger of being replaced as advertisers increasingly prefer photographs to drawings.The events of the movie are set in motion when the research facility\u2019s ruthless new security chief Colonel Richard Strickland \u2013 played by a fantastically sinister Michael Shannon \u2013 acquires an \u201casset\u201d from a South American river in the form of a fish-like humanoid that can breathe underwater and heal even the most serious injuries.Elisa\u2019s first encounter with the creature comes after an altercation between Strickland and the asset which results in the security chief losing two of his fingers.After glimpsing the creature and sharing a brief moment of mutual admiration, Elisa begins sneaking into its holding chamber, feeding it hard-boiled eggs and introducing it to music via a record player she smuggles in with a pile of dirty laundry.Elisa is taken with the creature, who signs with her and doesn\u2019t recoil from her inability to speak or the trio of scars on her neck.ADVERTISEMENTResearcher Robert Hoffstetler \u2013 who (spoiler alert) is actually a Soviet spy named Dimitri \u2013 watches Elisa teach the creature sign language and tells his American and Russian superiors that it is self-aware and intelligent, hoping they\u2019ll spare it from dissection.They don\u2019t listen.When Strickland\u2019s boss decides that they can best learn the creature\u2019s secrets from an autopsy, Elisa hatches a plan to free it with the help of Giles and her co-worker Zelda.I won\u2019t spoil the rest of the film except to say that it\u2019s an emotional roller coaster of a movie, as Hawkins and Jones draw the audience into a bizarre but compelling interspecies love story that touches on loneliness, love and natural human prejudice.Through body language and facial expressions, Jones and Hawkins manage to build sympathy for their characters, advancing their story arcs in astonishing fashion without uttering a single world.The settings are just as visually stunning as other Del Toro features, as the director expertly transports his viewers to an East Coast city in the Cold War era.The tender relationship between Elisa and the asset, as strange as it might seem on the surface, makes this movie one of Del Toro\u2019s most experimental and risky films, but the risk pays off and makes \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d worthwhile.The movie hits theaters Dec. 15."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/north-america-us-news-st-louis-dogs-cats-dfb8afee2f4b47c08de46b12d8e74adf", "headline": "C-A-T named D-O-G is star canine trainer | AP News", "date": "2017-12-14T07:18:03Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "ST.

(AP) \u2014 A summer trip to Disney World in Orlando last year so inspired Ashlie Wells that before the movie \u201cMoana\u201d even hit theaters, Wells started working on choreography for a dance production about the strong-willed daughter of a Polynesian chief trying to save her tribe\u2019s island.\u201cWe actually started working on this two, three months before the movie even came out,\u201d said Wells, the co-artistic director for Dothan\u2019s Southeast Alabama Dance Company (SEADAC).SEADAC will perform \u201cMoana\u2019s Island Adventure\u201d at the Dothan Civic Center on March 12 and at the Enterprise Performing Arts Center on March 19.For those who haven\u2019t seen the Oscar-nominated movie, 16-year-old Moana is chosen by the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti \u2014 a stone lost in the ocean after the demigod Maui stole it from the island goddess Te Fiti to give to humanity. With her island\u2019s vegetation dying and fish becoming scarce, Moana sets out to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tagging along is Moana\u2019s pet rooster, Heihei. Moana eventually teams up with Maui to return the heart of Te Fiti.ADVERTISEMENTSome of the movie\u2019s music will be featured in the dance production while some of the show\u2019s instrumental pieces were developed by Wells.\u201cThe company dancers helped me a lot,\u201d Wells said of creating the choreography. \u201cThey really inspire me and I\u2019m always asking them questions to help me.\u201dLike other spring dance productions by SEADAC, the first half \u2014 \u201cMoana\u2019s Island Adventure\u201d \u2014 lasts about an hour. The second act is filled with six dance numbers, including one inspired by the Broadway play \u201cHamilton.\u201dThere are a little over 100 cast members on \u201cMoana\u2019s island Adventure\u201d \u2014 31 company dancers, 75-80 non-company performers and about 25 backstage crew members. There\u2019s also some stunt flying for this production as Maui, danced by Joneisha Carmichael, transforms into a hawk.\u201cDisney is just something that everybody loves and it\u2019s a brand new movie so it\u2019s been a real experience to be able to learn and follow along with the movie,\u201d said Milana Reynolds, one of two dancers performing as Moana.Reynolds, 17, has been dancing since she was 8 or 9 years old. A senior at Enterprise High School, Reynolds will be a dance major at the University of Alabama after she graduates. Since the character of Moana is on stage during the entire show, the performance is a demanding one, which is why Reynolds and dancer Emily Faught are taking turns dancing the role.\u201cIt\u2019s been so hard,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cOnce we run through the whole thing, I am just exhausted at the end . You have to have a lot of stamina to get through it.\u201dMary Hinson Mims is dancing the role of Moana\u2019s pet rooster, Heihei. Her humorous rooster costume with bulging eyeballs is one of many new costumes company costume seamstress Cindi Tucker created for the production.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cIt\u2019s been my favorite production I have ever done with SEADAC,\u201d Mary said. \u201cI absolutely love it and love the movie. I personally love how just crazy and fun Heihei is and how much humor he brings to the show because although the movie is serious and inspiring, he brings a lot of the comedy to it.\u201dIn translating a story through dance, Wells said she thinks of the movements as a type of sign language for the audience.\u201cMy goal is to captivate the audience and to make it be a magical experience and to take them on a journey where they feel something special whether it be happiness or love or excitement,\u201d Wells said.___Information from: The Dothan Eagle, http://www.dothaneagle.com"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/new-york-adam-clayton-archive-race-and-ethnicity-017868aeceb54643b0ff699a40bcf4d4", "headline": "Michael Coard: Happy 109th Birthday Adam Clayton Powell Jr. | AP ...", "date": "2017-11-25T03:57:29Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "In just a few days, it\u2019ll be the 109th birthday of Adam Clayton Powell Jr., born on Nov. 29, 1908. Not only was he the first Black Congressman from New York, having been elected in 1945, he remains the most defiant, confrontational, and unapologetically pro-Black House (or Senate) member in U.S. history.In addition to being a congressman, he was also a national and international civil/human rights leader, minister of Harlem\u2019s Abyssinian Baptist Church, and publisher of The People\u2019s Voice Newspaper.Born in New Haven, Conn., he moved with his family to N.Y.C where his \u201cwoke\u201d father, the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Sr., who was pastor at Abyssinian. As an aside, it should be noted that his father also pastored here in Philly shortly before going to Harlem. Powell Jr. received his undergraduate degree from Colgate University and his master\u2019s degree in religious education from Columbia. And he was a proud member of Alpha Phi Alpha. In 1938, he replaced his father to lead Abyssinian and to continue its tradition of Black activism.ADVERTISEMENTImmediately thereafter, Powell expanded the church\u2019s social activism by serving many more of Harlem\u2019s poor Blacks with additional food and clothing. But he didn\u2019t merely provide warm meals and presentable apparel. He also provided self-respect and dignity by holding mass meetings to inspire poverty-stricken Blacks to fight for themselves via demonstrations that forced restaurants, stores, bus lines, utility services, phone companies, and other employers to hire and promote Blacks at rates that had never existed before.In 1939, he set up a picket line at the World\u2019s Fair\u2019s Empire State Building offices until officials there agreed to increase the number of Black employees from approximately 200 to 732. Two years later, he led a bus boycott that forced the NYC Transit System to hire 200 additional Blacks. And he didn\u2019t stop there. He pressured drugstores in Harlem to hire Black pharmacists and persuaded Black residents to join him in his 125th Street \u201cShop Only Where You Can Work\u201d movement, which succeeded so well that it shut down most of the stores and forced the remainder to submit.As a result of his tireless pro-Black activism, he was elected by the Harlem community to the NYC Council in 1941, thereby becoming the first Black to hold that office.In 1944, he set his sights higher by running for Congress and doing so on a \u201cfair employment, anti-lynching, and anti-poll tax\u201d platform. When he won and then took office in 1945, he quickly began addressing racial discrimination not only nationally but especially defiantly, confrontationally, and unapologetically.ADVERTISEMENTIt started when he protested the informal rule that barred Black Congressmen (and there were only two during that time) from using the Capitol restaurant, gym, and barbershop. In response, he would often take Blacks from the hood to dine with him at the \u201cwhites only\u201d Congressional restaurant.He also demanded that hardcore racist Representative John Rankin of Mississippi stop using the word \u201cn----r\u201d on the House floor and proclaimed \u201cThe time has come to impeach Rankin or at least expel him from the party.\u201d Also, when Rankin, who made it clear that he would not be seated next to a Black person at House sessions, refused, Powell followed him from seat-to-seat every time he could. And on one occasion, he pestered Rankin so bad that Rankin was forced to moved five separate times.When Powell wasn\u2019t trying to introduce anti-discrimination legislation, he, with the assistance of the NAACP, was attaching pro-civil rights clauses to legislation introduced by friends and foes alike. In fact, he did that so often that his relentless riders \u2014 which required the denial of federal funds to any jurisdiction that maintained segregation \u2014 came to be famously known as the \u201cPowell Amendment.\u201dPowell was so effective with this ingenious strategy that rabid racist Representative Cleveland Bailey of West Virginia punched him in the face during a congressional debate in 1955. But Powell ultimately won both the battle and the war because the language in his riders was ultimately incorporated into Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.Just as he fought for Blacks at home, he fought for us abroad. In 1955, he flew to Indonesia to attend the historic Bandung Conference of African and Asian Nations in order to get information about how the U.S. could support independent African governments in the post-colonial era. When he returned, he urged President Dwight Eisenhower and later JFK as well as LBJ to treat those new African governments with the same respect they treat European governments.Although Powell became an ancestor on April 4, 1972, his legacy continues. He remains one of modern-day America\u2019s greatest political leaders based on several groundbreaking laws and policies that stemmed from the pivotal role he played in passage of legislation that made lynching a federal crime, that increased minimum wage, that offered free school lunches, that provided assistance for the deaf, that enhanced student loan access, and that promoted social programs that rescued the poor under JFK\u2019s \u201cNew Frontier\u201d along with LBJ\u2019s \u201cGreat Society\u201d and \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d initiatives.As a congressman, Adam Clayton Powell Jr. represented Harlem from 1945-1971 after having been reelected for nearly three decades. And he did so as the most defiant, confrontational, and unapologetically pro-Black House (or Senate) member in U.S. history.He used to always say to us, \u201cKeep the faith, baby.\u201d Now we say to him, \u201cHappy 109th Birthday, Brother Adam!\u201d"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/d7153b18517348e79258956f787ca326", "headline": "Maine high school picks deaf student to be mascot | AP News", "date": "2016-11-29T05:02:56Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 A high school in Maine\u2019s largest city has picked a deaf student to serve as the school\u2019s sports mascot for the first time.Freshman Kameron King will don the Bulldog costume.

Technology has helped the industry meet growing demand by making production more efficient. At the same time, vast overproduction \u2013 propelled by fast fashion\u2019s demands for new styles \u2013 has led to a host of additional problems: increased chemical waste during production, along with thousands of tons of waste from worn, discarded or donated clothes.ADVERTISEMENTWhile clothing retail giant H&M has a global garment collection initiative \u2013 receiving used clothes and offering discounts in exchange for donations \u2013 there are signs that even clothing recycling efforts cannot keep up with garment production. And while many companies use biodegradable materials, the costs of recycling such a large volume may tip the balance back toward using cheaper, synthetic fabric alternatives that are bad for the environment.At the same time, fashion designers are utilizing technology to create new, environmentally conscious clothing. While generally relegated to the catwalk, these designs offer a glimpse of the future \u2013 and a critique of an industry that will soon be forced to address some of the problems created by mass production.\n                Annual global fashion industry revenue is a staggering US$1.2 trillion, with the U.S. apparel market the largest in the world. (Consuming about 28 percent of the global total, it has a market value of about $331 billion.)Many companies now adhere to the unsustainable \u201cfast fashion\u201d model, where consumers can expect to find new clothes rolled out on the racks nearly every week instead of once a season.But while technology has allowed companies to produce more garments more quickly and at less cost, fast fashion is now the second most wasteful industry in the world, behind the oil industry. A single garment creates a large carbon footprint, the result of production that includes farming, harvesting, manufacturing, processing and shipping. Pesticides in cotton farming, toxic dyes in manufacturing and landfill waste of discarded clothing add to the environmental costs of a garment.Some materials, like cotton, are recyclable, while other synthetic materials, like nylon and polyester, are not biodegradable. Even laundering these clothes can send thousands of tiny fibers and chemicals into the ocean.ADVERTISEMENTThinking about the full life cycle of the garment and closing wasteful loops creates new opportunities for apparel and tech industries. Unfortunately, technology\u2019s role in the fashion industry has mainly led to increased waste.That\u2019s starting to change. Designers such as Eileen Fisher, Stella McCartney and Ralph Lauren are attempting to reshape industry practices by using organic textiles and reducing water and carbon waste.Meanwhile, companies such as Levis are involved in projects to address their impact on the planet. Levis now dissolves old clothes to make a new fiber that the company uses in its jeans \u2013 an alternative to water-intensive cotton production.We\u2019re also now seeing the development of textiles called smart fabrics, which are clothes infused with technological elements that interact with the wearer. Many innovators of smart fabrics have garnered attention with prototypes such as gloves that translate hand motions from American Sign Language (ASL) into audible speech, shirts that allow deaf wearers to experience music through the use of lights and vibration, or dresses that allow wearers to charge their cellphones.\n                Sales growth of smart fabrics is projected to almost triple between 2012 and 2018 to $2 billion, while wearable technologies are expected to grow to $19 billion over the same period.While smart fabrics bridge intelligent design with access to new experiences or improved functionality, most of the products haven\u2019t been very stylish.But new collaborations in the fashion and technology spaces are starting to focus on the importance of style in functional design.For example, former Silicon Valley executive Dolly Singh brought together a diverse team \u2013 an astronaut, an orthopedic surgeon, a rocket scientist and a fashion scientist \u2013 to address a common problem: discomfort in women\u2019s high heels. They ended up combining engineering advances, design principles and advanced polymers to create a new flexible, strong and stylish stiletto. (They don\u2019t come cheaply: the shoes range in price from $300 to $900.)These kinds of innovations aren\u2019t being spurred just by large corporations and investors; universities are playing a big role, too. Harvard\u2019s Wyss Institute, MIT Design Lab and The Cornell Nanoscale Science & Technology Facility (CNF) are just a few of the labs that are bringing together designers, scientists, media and technology experts to study soft robotics and wearable technologies.Collaborations between design schools and large companies can also lead to advances in design, aesthetics and technology. For example, the Rhode Island School of Design has collaborated on research projects with sportswear companies to develop abstract concepts and ideas for future research directions. One proposed idea was knitting tubes for a system to carry fluids, within clothes, that can influence the wearer\u2019s temperature or carry electric current.Two recent exhibits have worked to further the conversation about the future of fashion and technology: the Museum of Fine Arts\u2019 #techstyle (March 6 to July 10, 2016) and Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Manus x Machine (May 5 to August 15, 2016).While the shows display many pieces produced exclusively for the runway, they offer a glimpse at how technology can be used to repurpose and reduce fashion waste.For example, #techstyle features a piece by the company Bionic Yarn, which weaves denim clothing using recycled bottles found in the ocean. Another work makes an even greater conceptual leap: Designer Iris van Herpen\u2019s \u201cWater Splash Dress\u201d uses recycled PET plastic and acrylic spray, creating the design from a video capture of actual water splashes.Some designers, such as van Herpen, may think of technology as \u201cjust a tool\u201d in their craft. But technology opens up a world of possibilities for designers to collaborate and innovate for individual and global needs.At a roundtable discussion on Fashion and Technology at the CUNY Graduate Center, Amanda Parks of Manufacture NY noted how it\u2019s important to find a \u201csweet spot\u201d between craft and technology. She called Nike\u2019s Flyknit running shoe an example of a product that hits this \u201csweet spot.\u201d  The shoe is knit to the shape of the foot, wastes almost no material, has a superb fit and is offered at a marketable price point (between $130 and $150).With consumers primed to expect ready-to-wear fashion, it\u2019s important for designers to utilize technology to craft products with purpose, that are good for the environment but also aesthetically pleasing and affordable.Only then will the fashion industry move toward a more sustainable and smarter future.This article was originally published on The Conversation.

The dog, well, he nearly lost his life to humans.A French mastiff named Hooch, rescued by Zach Skow in Tehachapi, California, is the 2016 American Humane organization\u2019s Hero Dog of the Year, bestowed in a Beverly Hills ceremony taped in September for broadcast at 8 p.m. EDT Friday on the Hallmark Channel.Hooch, among eight canine finalists, wore his best tuxedo collar, though he was reluctant to join Skow on stage.Hosted by James Denton and Beth Stern, and featuring Dave Foley, Kym Johnson, Robert Herjavec, Marilu Henner and Greg Louganis, among other celebrities, this is the sixth year for the awards.ADVERTISEMENTThe finalists come in all shapes and sizes \u2014 and all were honored for the work they do. Some protect the vulnerable and comfort the sick. Others assist police, military veterans and rescue the lost.Hooch, on the other hand, was nominated for surviving \u2014 and he was No. 1.He was the \u201cemerging hero dog,\u201d having been rescued about three years ago with the help of Skow, founder and operator of Marley\u2019s Mutts Dog Rescue in Tehachapi. Skow said the rescue goes the other way around as well.Skow, from age 16 to 28, when he nearly died of liver failure, is a recovering addict, about eight years sober. As part of his rehabilitation, he went into dog rescue.\u201cHooch has helped me stay in the moment \u2014 not only in the moment, but out of my head,\u201d Skow explained in a recent interview. \u201cI need to be thinking about something other than me.\u201dHe calls the dogs he rescues his \u201chope.\u201d As for Hooch, he received a call one day from a local animal control officer about an ailing French mastiff who was emaciated, had a broken tail and had recently had his ears badly cropped. The dog refused to eat, instead batting his bowls around wildly.Skow thought something was wrong with Hooch\u2019s jaw. When the dog was checked by a veterinarian, they discovered that his tongue had been maliciously cut off at the base, possibly to stop excessive barking or use him as \u201cbait\u201d to train fighting dogs.The copper-colored Hooch can\u2019t chew and drools profusely. Skow had to figure out how to feed him. Hooch pulled out a feeding tube. Skow then found that softening dry food with hot water and putting it straight down Hooch\u2019s mouth worked, and the dog slowly regained his health.Now, Hooch spends some of his time with non-verbal autistic kids, calming them as they learn social skills. Remarkably, Hooch trusts people, though loud noises like the cheering he received on the night of his big win tend to shut him down.\u201cHe has every reason to mistrust every person he comes across and that has never crossed his mind,\u201d Skow said. \u201cHe exudes happiness.\u201dThe first spoken word for some of the autistic kids the two meet is \u201cHooch,\u201d added Skow, who is now 37.ADVERTISEMENTHooch does other work as well, as a companion to women in shelters who have been victims of domestic abuse, for instance.\u201cEveryone called for us to euthanize him,\u201d Skow said. \u201cNo one could fathom that he would have a good quality of life. He\u2019s a testament to all of those dogs that don\u2019t have a chance, that don\u2019t have hope. That\u2019s exactly what I was.\u201dThe other seven finalists for Hero Dog, all honored for their service, are:\u2014 Law enforcement: Edo, a K-9 superstar with the Los Angeles Police Department, and handler Nhut Huynh. Edo, a Belgian malinois, was the first sent into a house where a shootout was underway. He pulled the armed man away from his weapon.\u2014 Search and rescue: Kobuk, a German shepherd, and handler Elizabeth Fossett in York, Maine. He sniffed out an elderly woman with diabetes and dementia after she wandered off from a cabin in the wilderness.\u2014 Service: Gander, a labradoodle rescue, and handler Lon Hodge. Hodge is an Army veteran in Great Lakes, Illinois, who suffers from post traumatic stress disorder and was once homebound for months at a time. The two are inseparable and travel the country helping others with disabilities. \u201cThank you for saving my life,\u201d Hodge told his beloved Gander on the show.\u2014 Military: Layka, another Belgian malinois, and trainer/veteran Julian McDonald in Galena, Kansas. The dog lost a leg when she took fire while McDonald\u2019s Ranger unit was assaulting an enemy compound in Afghanistan. McDonald and his family adopted Layka.\u2014 Arson: Judge and handler Lee Laubach Jr., fire chief in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Judge is a yellow Labrador who has worked more than 275 fire scenes and has found evidence leading to multiple arrests and civil penalties for insurance fraud.\u2014 Hearing: Hook, a 12-pound, 10-year-old Chihuahua mix, and handler Joyce Herman. Herman, from Sacramento, California, is a hearing-impaired marriage and family therapist.

Do you prefer one?ADVERTISEMENTPritchard: For me, whether it\u2019s something I\u2019m writing for someone else, something I\u2019m writing for me, or something for \u2018Songbird,\u2019 it all originates in this really bluesy place. And then what happens is you put it on a different voice in a different body, you change the instrumentation, you change the key of the song. There are all these contributing factors that can adjust the heaviness or the softness of that bluesy origin. But I do know that it comes from the same place.AP: How to do keep track of it all? Are you a good compartmentalizer?Pritchard: Part of the way that I made it easy for myself to split my lives is literally give them different names. One is my own name, my birth name. And one is LOLO because for me the only thing that those two things have to do with each other is me. They are the same in a sort of soulfulness, but in theory they\u2019re not the same. To me, they warranted different names. That was how I was able to clear it up for myself, too, internally. It\u2019s been incredibly helpful.AP: What kind of songwriter are you?Pritchard: I\u2019ve always been, maybe to a fault, a very honest songwriter. In some ways I feel like I\u2019m terrible with words when I\u2019m just talking. But I can write. Maybe it\u2019s a clearer, more direct place in my mind. I use less words, which is probably helpful. If you want to know how I really feel, listen to the last few songs I wrote.AP: Who might we be surprised you\u2019re a fan of?Pritchard: Eminem. \u2018The Marshall Mathers LP\u2019 is in the top five of my favorite albums of all time. I think that I gained a lot of my lyrical wordiness appreciation from him. He\u2019s one of my favorite songwriters of all time.AP: You saw the new \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d featuring actors using sign language. What did you think?ADVERTISEMENTPritchard: I think it\u2019s really beautiful. I mean, obviously I\u2019m biased. But I thought that since the lyrics and the story itself are very dense \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of information to retain \u2014 there\u2019s something about incorporating the sign language into the telling of the story that makes you pay even more attention to the words, which I really appreciated.AP: Might you be lured back to theater?Pritchard: I do think that if the right thing did come along and presents itself as far as theater and acting goes, I would do it. But especially considering that I spend most of my time touring, committing to a show for a year is a lot to think about.AP: How does it feel to be both a stage writer and a rock star?Pritchard: I now feel like I\u2019m using myself to my full potential. It\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t doing that before. But if you\u2019re only working on one thing, you\u2019re closing off another part of your mind.

Neighbors shunned, and sometimes mocked her. Some of the people who took care of her periodically hauled her off to rituals where soothsayers would attempt to cure the medical condition, still mysterious to this day, that caused her deafness.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cI was confused by my sudden hearing loss and filled with a sense of hopelessness from being ostracized for it. Why can\u2019t I go to school? Why am I not being taken along with the other kids in my family during outings? Why do people stare? Why do they laugh at me?\u201d Gordon, now a prominent lawyer and disability rights advocate in Washington, recalls of those traumatic days in the early 1980s.Her experience was similar to that of many physically and mentally disabled people in the Caribbean, where resources and basic protections for the disabled are often scarce. But things appear to be gradually improving after years of struggle.Jamaica last week passed a watershed law that will, among other things, prohibit workplace discrimination and create a special tribunal to rule on complaints made by disabled citizens. The adoption of the law follows similar actions taken in Bahamas and Guyana. Sign language interpreters are seen more often on Caribbean TV stations and schools are becoming more inclusive of students with disabilities.\u201cIt\u2019s catching on in the region,\u201d Gloria Goffe, a blind Jamaican who is coordinator of the nonprofit Combined Disabilities Association, said of efforts to protect people with disabilities.Jamaica\u2019s long-awaited Disabilities Act was shepherded by Sen. Floyd Morris, who made history last year when he was sworn in as the first blind president of the country\u2019s Senate. He describes the law as a historic achievement for the roughly 163,000 disabled Jamaicans.But Morris cautioned there is a long way to go before pervasive stigma can be banished.\u201cI would say 65 percent of the population still sees people with disabilities as charity cases,\u201d he said in his office at the University of the West Indies, where he leads a regional research center studying issues affecting the disabled.The changing landscape for disabled citizens will be measured most by maturing attitudes, said Gordon, who had to leave her Caribbean homeland to fully realize her potential. She moved to New York at age 11 and blossomed after being given the opportunity to work hard and excel.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cLaws cannot regulate attitude and sadly the perception and attitude toward people with disabilities can be more disabling than our disability in and of itself,\u201d Gordon wrote in an email to The Associated Press in her personal capacity.Shattering the early preconceptions about her abilities, Gordon is now chief of staff at a contract compliance office in the U.S. Department of Labor. Last year she served a high-profile stint as a liaison between President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and the disabled community.Around the globe, the treatment of people with disabilities varies widely from country to country, but discrimination and barriers to inclusion are commonplace. Those problems are most severe in the developing world, where the World Health Organization says roughly 80 percent of people with disabilities live.Nowhere in the region is the problem of stigma and access to basic health services more serious than in Haiti, the hemisphere\u2019s poorest country. The magnitude-7.0 earthquake in January 2010 amplified the problem, leaving thousands of people with lost limbs, some with multiple amputations.\u201cTheir situation is very worrying, because without access to services they become a burden on families, which increases their vulnerability,\u201d said Patrick Senia, field program director in Haiti for nonprofit Handicap International.Even in wealthier, more inclusive countries in the Caribbean where treatment of disabled people is making advances, the challenges are many. Relatively few buildings have wheelchair-accessible ramps and toilets. Discrimination in hiring has long been rampant. Schools lack physical therapists and other care.New disability laws will have to beat back harsh realities, the most pressing of which is financial. Advocates stress that it is one thing to pass legislation and another to ensure implementation, particularly in heavily indebted countries. For instance, economically struggling Guyana passed its disabilities act in 2010 but compliance has been spotty.\u201cNext year, we are going to require all public buildings to be user friendly with ramps. At my own ministry, we don\u2019t have an elevator, so all the services that the public and the differently-able need will be on the ground floor,\u201d Social Services Minister Jennifer Webster said.But even as they grapple with overcoming numerous challenges, hopes for the future are rising among many disabled youngsters in the Caribbean.\u201cI am definitely going to be a doctor,\u201d 9-year-old Arron Logan said confidently as he walked with the shuffling steps of a relatively mild case of cerebral palsy at an under-resourced Kingston school that integrates disabled children with able-bodied peers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what kind yet, but I do know that\u2019s what I will be.\u201d___David McFadden on Twitter: http://twitter.com/dmcfadd", "date": "2014-10-16T04:07:45Z"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/129f50c809314daf91c986a7e7697fcc", "headline": "Brazil's indigenous seek out city, end up in slums | AP News", "source": "AP News", "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 They huddle in a tight circle, shaking seed-filled maracas and shuffling in time to a rhythm that has pulsed through their tribes for generations. The dancers raise their voices in song, conjuring an ancient spirit that vibrates above the traffic roaring from a nearby expressway and the beat of funk music blasting from a neighbor\u2019s loudspeaker.In this Brazilian favela, a dense hodgepodge of humble cinderblock homes filled with some of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poorest residents, the indigenous people whose cultures predate recorded history are struggling to keep their traditions alive in the face of modernity. Seeking jobs and forced out of their native lands by loggers, miners and farmers, an estimated 22,000 Brazilian Indians now call the crowded favelas their home.ADVERTISEMENTDeforestation continues to reshape the Amazon rain forest region that is home to a third of Brazil\u2019s indigenous people. The rate of deforestation rose 29 percent last year, compared with a year earlier, the Brazilian government reported last week.\u201cThere are no more forests, no more fish. We\u2019ve got to survive so we go to the cities. But they\u2019re so expensive, where can we live but the favelas?\u201d asked Sandra Benites, a Guarani tribeswoman who moved to Rio\u2019s Complexo Sao Carlos slum in 2010 from the neighboring state of Espirito Santo. \u201cDespite the problems, at least in the village you\u2019re surrounded by a community. In the city, you\u2019re alone.\u201dBenites, a 39-year-old teacher who also uses her tribal name Ara Rete, joined other indigenous urbanites recently to celebrate a traditional ritual in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Mare favela. The gatherings of about a dozen people, from as many tribes, provide a sense of community that helps them endure the \u201cdouble discrimination\u201d they face.\u201cIf you\u2019re educated and not wearing a grass skirt, city people will say, \u2018You\u2019re not a real Indian,\u2019\u201d said Benites, whose husband and four children remain back in their village, an overnight bus trip away. \u201cBut when you go back home, your own people will say you\u2019re too assimilated. It\u2019s very upsetting.\u201dTwry Pataxo agreed. A member of the 11,000-strong Pataxo tribe, she moved from the northeastern state of Bahia to Rio as a teenager in order to continue school. For the past 15 years, she\u2019s lived in Rio\u2019s Mare Complex, a sprawling and notoriously violent slum where nearly half of residents eke by on just dollars a day and drug dealers ply their trade undeterred by the soldiers deployed there earlier this year.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that if you\u2019re an Indian you have to live in a native village and wear a feather headdress,\u201d said Pataxo, who runs the \u201cMaes da Mare\u201d charity aimed at helping battered women of all ethnicities by making and selling handicrafts. \u201cSo basically, we urban Indians have two options. We can try to deny our ancestry and blend in or we can try to preserve our culture and face discrimination.\u201dMost choose the first option, said Pataxo.\u201cWhen I see someone with Indian features here in the favela, I go up to them and say, \u2018Do you know you\u2019re Indian?\u2019 More often than not, they deny it,\u201d said Pataxo, a mother of two. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be Indian in Brazil. The word \u2018Indian\u2019 is synonymous with laziness and stupidity. So if you\u2019re living among strangers in a favela, where as long as you don\u2019t dress like an Indian or act like an Indian you can pretty much blend in, why would you admit  to being Indian?\u201dPataxo, on the other hand, revels in her identity. She rarely leaves the house without her signature seed and feather native jewelry and organizes monthly meetings at her two-room cinderblock home, welcoming indigenous people from the Mare and beyond. During the get-togethers, participants feast on fish cooked in banana leaves in Pataxo\u2019s yard, a narrow strip of land along a multilane expressway where the scent of raw sewage is overwhelming.Thought to number in the several millions in pre-Columbian times, Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples have been decimated by 500 years of persecution and disease. Now, the country\u2019s 305 native tribes include 900,000 people, or just 0.4 percent of Brazil\u2019s population of roughly 200 million, according to Brazil\u2019s 2010 census.Nearly one in four indigenous people now live in urban areas, according to the census figures, and anecdotal evidence suggests growing numbers are living in slums.Selma Lenice Gomes, a 37-year-old from the Pankararu tribe, moved to Sao Paulo\u2019s Real Parque favela some 15 years ago to attend college. The Pankararu have been migrating from their home in the northeastern state of Pernambuco to Real Parque since the 1950s, initially attracted by construction jobs on the nearby Morumbi soccer stadium. Now, of Real Parque\u2019s roughly 24,000 residents, around 720 of them are Pankararus \u2014 meaning nearly one in 10 of the tribe\u2019s 8,000 members resides in the slum.While the move allowed Gomes to pursue a degree in social work, certain facts of life in the slum took a particular toll.\u201cAt home in the village, it\u2019s full of open spaces. You feel like you can breathe,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I first got to Sao Paulo, I was scared because I had never seen a favela before, all of those houses stacked one practically on top of the other.\u201d\u201cWe had nowhere to practice our rituals, nowhere to be all together,\u201d she said.But the worst part was the ruthless drug gangs. Like most favelas across the country, the government was all but absent from Real Parque, and with no policing, the armed gangs represented the slum\u2019s ultimate authority.\u201cIn the village you were free \u2014 free to say whatever you wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the slum, you had to learn to be blind, deaf and mute about what some of the things that went on here or you\u2019d find yourself in real trouble.\u201dStill, despite the difficulties, life in the slums has its advantages, insisted Pataxo, who lives in Rio\u2019s Mare slum.\u201cIt was hard at first. People mocked me for being an Indian. But now everyone here knows me, and I know I can count on my neighbors,\u201d she said. \u201cThe slums are the one place in the city where you have the kind of solidarity we Indians have in the villages.\u201d", "date": "2014-09-16T04:03:20Z"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/bronx-archive-3e90a187f9c14c8cbc5cf47ad7256720", "headline": "Avery Corman writes memoir of Bronx boyhood", "date": "2014-06-09T13:30:40Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "\u201cMy Old Neighborhood Remembered\u201d (Barricade Books), by Avery CormanBefore Brooklyn became a hipster haven with pricey real estate and the Bronx became the poster child for urban blight, neighborhood life in those outer boroughs was pretty much the same.That\u2019s the recollection of Avery Corman, who grew up in the Bronx during the 1940s and \u201950s and went on to write novels that became the basis for the hit movies \u201cKramer vs. Kramer\u201d and \u201cOh God!\u201d In a later novel, \u201cThe Old Neighborhood,\u201d the hard-driving protagonist reconnects with his childhood neighborhood in the Bronx, rediscovers his roots and finds inner peace and contentment.ADVERTISEMENTNow Corman has returned to that same nostalgia-laden turf, this time with a charming and lyrical memoir, \u201cMy Old Neighborhood Remembered,\u201d about his Bronx boyhood in a nontraditional working-class household with a divorced mother, an older sister, and an aunt and uncle, both of them deaf mutes.With few organized activities and no hovering parents to schedule them, kids took to the streets to create their own fun. It was a world of punchball, Johnny-on-a-pony, Ringolevio and, of course, stickball, in which players would keep an eye out for an approaching police car and roll the bat under a parked car before a cop could confiscate it.An iconic element of street life was the local candy store, a neighborhood hangout where youngsters might sip an egg cream while reading a comic book off the rack. They could buy a notebook and a protractor for school, or a Spaldeen, the pink rubber ball used for stickball. Some candy stores had a resident bookmaker and might sport signs outside reading \u201cCars to the Track\u201d to lure horseplayers.With television in its infancy, movie theaters were everywhere. None was more ornate than the famously baroque Loew\u2019s Paradise, a 3,855-seat landmark on the Grand Concourse, a short walk from Corman\u2019s apartment. Stern-faced matrons dressed in white and armed with flashlights patrolled the children\u2019s section, ready to pounce on kids who might commit such infractions as noisily humming through their candy boxes.As Corman progressed through grade school, junior high and high school, his mother worked her way up from a $14-a-week stock clerk at Alexander\u2019s, the big department store that was essentially a discount operation but \u201coffered the illusion of upscale shopping.\u201d She eventually became a buyer at J.W. Mays in Brooklyn, swapping a long subway ride each day for a job that secured her status as solidly middle class.ADVERTISEMENTThe author goes on to describe the mystery of his father\u2019s disappearance, the impact of college basketball scandals that implicated Bronx sports heroes and the travails of Hebrew school in preparation for his bar mitzvah. He managed to stumble through the ceremony but then didn\u2019t set foot in a synagogue for 23 years.After high school, Corman studied business at New York University but failed to land his dream job as a copywriter on Madison Avenue. It was the start of the \u201cMad Men\u201d era and agencies tended to exclude Jews, other \u201cethnics\u201d and applicants with degrees from non-Ivy League colleges.People tend to romanticize their childhood, but the post-World War II Bronx was a time and place that conveyed a sense of community and vitality to those who grew up there. Many have moved on but still carry fond memories that Corman\u2019s quick read is sure to evoke. His anecdotes and reminiscences are likely to resonate most strongly with fellow Bronxites, but readers unfamiliar with the world of his childhood are sure to be charmed and entertained by this delightful account of city life more than a half-century ago."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/2505bea3e2d24894a7ea91bcf52bdfdf", "headline": "Original AP story on the 1963 March on Washington | AP News", "source": "AP News", "text": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 On Aug. 28, 1963, AP reporter Raymond J. Crowley went to the National Mall and chronicled the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which went on to become one of the most famous political rallies in U.S. history. Writing in the language and style used by journalists of his era, Crowley duly noted a wide range of details about the event, from the size of the crowd and the songs the marchers sang to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s reaction, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech, and the three arrests made by police. Fifty years after its original publication, the AP is making this story available to its subscribers.ADVERTISEMENT___In a great, dramatic demonstration, more than 200,000 Negroes and white sympathizers massed before the Abraham Lincoln Memorial today and demanded across-the-board abolition of race discrimination.Then, after the \u201cmarch for jobs and freedom,\u201d President Kennedy asserted that \u201cthe cause of 20 million Negroes has been advanced\u201d by the gigantic, orderly assemblage.Kennedy conferred with 10 march leaders at the White House and issued a statement pledging a continued drive for civil rights legislation, for the removal of job barriers, for better education and full employment.It was appropriate, he said, that the demonstration was conducted before the nation\u2019s shrine to the Great Emancipator. The contribution thus made to the Negro cause is great, he said, \u201cbut even more significant is the contribution to all mankind.\u201dBy special train, plane, buses by the thousand, private automobiles and even in some cases on foot, the marchers poured into the capital. As they headed homeward tonight, the small army of police and National Guardsmen mustered to cope with feared disorder could report that only three arrests had been made \u2014 and not one of these was a demonstrator.Though the temperature was a balmy 84 and a cool wind stirred, many marchers fainted by the wayside. More than 1,700 were treated at first aid tents or hospitals for ills such as ribs fractured in the crush, headaches and insect bites.Gathering around the Washington Monument, the great sea of humanity moved toward the Lincoln Memorial, which enshrines the marble statue of the man who freed the slaves 100 years ago.Softly, as they went, they chanted the familiar civil rights hymn:\u201cDeep in my heart I do believe ... some day we shall overcome.\u201dADVERTISEMENTAnd a forest of placards moved with them. Some of these struck a religious note:\u201cGod of wisdom, God of fewer, can America deny freedom in this hour?\u201dOthers were more down-to-earth and slangy:\u201cNo U.S. dough to help Jim Crow!\u201dOf all the speeches at the memorial, the one that drew the strongest applause was made by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Departing from his advance text, he said:\u201cI still have a dream, a dream deeply rooted in the American dream that one day this nation will rise up and live up to its creed: We hold those truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\u201d\u201cI have a dream that one day in Alabama, little black boys and little black girls will be able to go hand in hand together with little white boys and little white girls as brothers and sisters.\u201cThis is the faith that I will take down to the South \u2014 that out of this mountain of despair, I can find a soul of brotherhood.\u201cLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill in Mississippi, from every city and state in the country.\u201dWhen King finished, there were cries of \u201che\u2019s a powerhouse,\u201d and even one shouted salute to \u201cthe next president of the United States.\u201dJohn Lewis, chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, toned down a fiery speech he had prepared.It was learned from a competent source that the Very Rev. Patrick A. O\u2019Boyle, Roman Catholic archbishop of Washington, had served notice he would refuse to give the invocation unless the speech were changed. He was said to consider it inflammatory and contrary to the constructive purpose of the gathering.Lewis confirmed that he had been forced to \u201ccapitulate\u201d into making changes. He told a reporter that the archbishop had \u201csaid he would not appear on the same platform with a speaker making this and some other statements in my speech.\u201dSo out came such passages as:\u201cWe cannot depend on any political party, for both the Democrats and Republicans have betrayed the basic principles of the Declaration of Independence.\u201dIn the advance text, Lewis said the Kennedy civil rights bill is \u201ctoo little and too late\u201d and \u201cwe cannot support it.\u201d Upon delivery, Lewis said \u201cwe support the administration\u2019s civil rights bill, but with reservations.\u201dAt 7:55 p.m. EDT, the last of the 23 special trains departed, and by 11 p.m. Union Station and the city\u2019s two main bus terminals showed little sign of the earlier traffic load. The Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial areas, scene of a vast gathering just hours before, were virtually deserted.Police Chief Robert V. Murray, meeting with newsmen tonight, pronounced it a \u201cvery orderly demonstration.\u201dAsked to estimate how many of the demonstrators were Negroes and how many white, he said he believed about 90 percent were Negroes.A holiday atmosphere pervaded the city. Many government workers took the day off and many business offices closed. Stores in the downtown area were largely deserted.William H. Press, executive vice president of the Washington Board of Trade, said that while he had no actual figures \u201cI imagine business is off 80 percent. ... There\u2019s nobody in the stores.\u201dCongregating at the Lincoln Memorial, the vast audience stretched far back toward the east end of the magnificent reflecting pool \u2014 toward the spot where in a semi-circular, separate pool, water lilies bloomed.At the memorial, they heard many speeches, many songs and spirituals. They heard speakers demand passage of President Kennedy\u2019s civil rights bill \u2014 and much more.A. Philip Randolph, 74-year-old prime promoter of the march, struck at those who want to amend the program to exempt little establishments from the proposed anti-discrimination ban \u2014 places like \u201cMrs. Murphy\u2019s boarding house.\u201d\u201cWe must destroy the notion,\u201d said Randolph, the president of the AFL-CIO Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, \u201cthat Mrs. Murphy\u2019s property rights include the right to humiliate me because of the color of my skin.\u201dA great cheer went up when Randolph announced that more than 150 members of Congress were in seats on the broad marble steps of the memorial.Film star Burt Lancaster unrolled a scroll he had brought with him by plane from Americans in Paris. It expressed fervent hope that all America would be \u201cliberated from the prison of their biases and fears.\u201dMarlon Brando of films was there, too, carrying with him a cattle prod of a type he said has been used in some places to make civil rights demonstrators move on.\u201cThis instrument will burn you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the scars on people.\u201cBut we must not believe that Southern people are entirely responsible. We are all responsible, East and West too.\u201dWhat effect the march would have on Congress remained to be seen, though Ralph Bunche, world-known American Negro official of the United Nations, told the throng:\u201cAnybody who cannot understand the significance of your participation here today is blind and deaf.\u201dComing here by train, plane, bus, auto \u2014 and even some on foot \u2014 the throng built up slowly but steadily to the estimate of 200,000, including Washingtonians.Despite advanced predictions by critics of possible wholesale disorder, the marchers \u2014 who numbered black and white, Protestants, Catholics and Jews \u2014 were studiously polite to one and all as they assembled and then marched to the Lincoln Memorial on the bank of the Potomac.As the meeting went on, police reported only two arrests had been made thus far \u2014 neither one of them demonstrators. One was identified as a deputy leader of \u201cthe American Nazi Party\u201d who persisted in trying to make a speech, despite police warnings, and the other, a 20-year-old, was alleged to have seized a placard from a marcher and broken it.A third arrest was reported several blocks away as the meeting was breaking up. Police took a local motorist into custody when they found a sawed-off shotgun on the front seat of his car. He was charged with carrying a prohibited weapon.There were hundreds of cases of heat exhaustion or fainting, most of them released after treatment at first aid stations.There was one scare when an anonymous caller told police bombs had been planted in the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial. This proved false, but for a while the Washington Monument was closed and nobody could ride the elevator to the top of the obelisk.The carefully drilled force of 5,000 officers \u2014 policemen, police reservists, National Guardsmen \u2014 had little or no occasion to display any muscle. They were aided, in the great task of crowd control, by off-duty Negro policemen from New York and other \u201cmarch marshals,\u201d wearing golden-hued armbands.George Lincoln Rockwell, leader of the American Nazi Party, showed up before dawn at the Washington Monument in hopes of holding a meeting despite an official ban.Police quickly threw out a cordon of 200 men to separate him from the marchers. After some hours, in which few gathered around to listen to him, he marched off with his 70 troopers, saying disgustedly, \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of my race.\u201dThe big demonstration was a unique mixture of revival meeting, picnic and denunciations of what speakers called man\u2019s inhumanity to man.As the speaking went on many demonstrators \u2014 mostly small fry \u2014 took off their shoes and socks, sat on the edge of the reflecting pool and cooled their feet in the water.Earlier, many broke out picnic lunches on the monument grounds, queued up at the big military trucks marked \u201cwater\u201d and at the many portable restrooms.Police Chief Murray said the throng was perhaps the largest in the city\u2019s history \u2014 apart from presidential inaugurations.In fact the crowd was so big that some demonstrators were still coming into town by bus at a time when others were waiting at Union Station to go home by train. These latter decided they could not get near enough to the Lincoln Memorial, and would get a head start homeward.There were some snafus. For example, Hollywood stars got tied up in traffic and could not get to the Washington Monument on schedule to entertain \u2014 or take a bow before \u2014 the people waiting to start the march.\u201cOur program is a bit ragged around the edges,\u201d the loudspeakers boomed at this point. \u201cThe people who were to appear are evidently a long way from here.\u201dPhilosophically, the crowd began to entertain itself with a deep-throated song: \u201cFreedom is a-coming. Oh, yes.\u201dLater, singer Marian Anderson arrived at the Lincoln Memorial in tears because she was just seconds too late to sing \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner.\u201dCamilla Williams sang it instead. Later the crowd got to hear Miss Anderson in the spiritual \u201cHe\u2019s Got the Whole World in His Hands.\u201dAt the big blue-and-white headquarters tent of the march, many people lined up to sign a pledge:\u201cI affirm my complete personal commitment for the struggle for jobs and freedom for all Americans. To fulfill that commitment, I pledge that I will not relax until victory is won.\u201d", "date": "2013-08-28T20:36:30Z"}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/science-dolphins-9b6141ca0196477d978e0c52c40a5958", "headline": "Deaf dolphin rescued in La. is going to Miss. | AP News", "date": "2012-09-09T18:05:02Z", "source": "AP News", "text": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A deaf dolphin found stranded in March off the Louisiana coast is being taken to live among other dolphins at a facility in Mississippi.Suzanne Smith is the rescue coordinator at the Audubon Nature Institute.

They were promised money if they posed for pictures and watched sex videos with a sandy-haired, brown-eyed companion who offered them drinks. \t   Whoever they thought he was, Dahmer turned out to be a butcher who told police they met a singular fate: He spiked their drinks with sleeping potions, strangled them and cut up their bodies, keeping their heads and other body parts in his apartment. ADVERTISEMENT\t   Grieving families are struggling to understand how their loved ones could have been willingly taken in. One clue comes from the man who escaped Dahmer\u2019s clutches Monday night and alerted police. \t   \u2033He seemed so normal,\u2033 said Tracy Edwards, 32, a father of six who met Dahmer at a city mall and was led there by an invitation to a party. \u2033He turned from Mr. Right to Mr. It ... It was like I was confronting Satan himself.\u2033 \t   Edwards fled with a handcuff dangling from one wrist. He had spotted a large knife under Dahmer\u2019s bed and smelled the stench of death of 11 others who had been there before him. \t   Dahmer, 31, a former employee of the Ambrosia Chocolate Co., admitted killing 11 people in his apartment, and police say he has killed six others. Dahmer is a convicted child molester with a history of alcohol abuse. The boy he molested in 1989 was the brother of one of his victims. \t   Those killed in the apartment ranged in age from 14 to 33. Police said nine were black, one was Laotian and one was white. Police on Saturday identified the 11th victim, Anthony Sears, 26, of Milwaukee.      One of them, Jeremiah Weinberger, 23, was last seen July 6 leaving Carol\u2019s Speakeasy, a gay bar in Chicago, with an unidentified man. Dahmer told police he and Weinberger took a Greyhound bus for the 90-mile trip to Milwaukee. \t   Weinberger stayed two days and the two had sex. But Dahmer objected when he wanted to leave, so he was drugged before he was killed and mutilated. Dahmer paused from his gory chores to take pictures. \t   \u2033My son was hypnotized by a cobra. Unfortunately, he bit,\u2033 Weinberger\u2019s father, David, told a reporter this week. \t   Two Chicago gay publications ran notices of Weinberger\u2019s disappearance, and his friends distributed fliers, urging anyone with information to call a toll- free number. No one did. \t   Another victim, Oliver Lacy, 23, disappeared July 12 when he went to a Milwaukee mall for ice cream. Lacy had moved here from Chicago four months ago to be near his 2-year-old son and his fiance. \t   \u2033I don\u2019t know how this person lured my son,\u2033 said the victim\u2019s mother, Catherine. \u2033He wasn\u2019t the type of person who would let someone come up to him like that.\u2033 \t   Lacy\u2019s death was particularly chilling. Dahmer said he had anal sex with Lacy after he was killed. Dahmer also told police he cut up the body and saved the heart \u2033to eat later.\u2033 \t   The most troubling case involved Konerak Sinthasomphone, 14, the son of Laotian immigrants who was going to play soccer with friends when he vanished May 26. \t   Several residents alleged that police missed a chance to stop Dahmer when the boy was seen May 27 staggering around the streets naked and bleeding from the buttocks. \t   But the boy was allowed to return to Dahmer who apparently convinced police that it was a squabble between two homosexual lovers. \t   Police Chief Philip Arreola suspended three officers Friday after confirming they had contact with Dahmer and the victim. He said they failed to write a report or check Dahmer\u2019s background, which included his conviction of molesting Sinthasomphone\u2019s older brother. The police union called the suspensions premature. \t   \u2033The whole thing is crazy. I don\u2019t know what to say,\u2033 said Anoukone Sinthasomphone, 25, the brother of the dead boy. \t   Some families had grown accustomed to frequent wanderings. \t   Catherine Straughter, grandmother of Curtis Straughter, 18, said he left their Milwaukee home on Feb. 18. \t   \u2033I haven\u2019t seen him since that day,\u2033 Mrs. Straughter said Friday. \u2033He was out all over with everybody.\u2033 \t   Matt Turner, 20, ran away from his home in Flint, Mich., and had resided at a halfway house for runaways in Chicago. His family last heard from him June 29, the day before Dahmer said he met Turner at a gay rally in Chicago. They took a bus back to Milwaukee. \t   The family of Ricky Beeks, 33, of Rockford, Ill., also said it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to be gone for long periods. Beeks, also known as Raymond Lamont Smith, was last seen in May 1990 when he came to Milwaukee to visit family. Beeks had a 10-year-old daughter. \t   Other families fretted over missing loved ones but felt powerless. \t   Tony Hughes, 31, of Madison, was last seen May 24 with a friend leaving the 219 Club, a gay bar in Milwaukee. His mother, Shirley, said Hughes, a deaf mute, was visiting family here and indicated he would be staying overnight with them. \t   Hughes had taken a new job two weeks earlier but never got his first paycheck, she said. She was unable to contact the friend because she only knew a first name - Jeffrey. \t   \u2033He was outgoing, jolly, happy. He could easily make friends,\u2033 Ms. Hughes said of her son. \u2033I just prayed and asked the Lord to show me where my son was. I just wanted to know if he was dead or alive. The way he died, it hurts. Words can\u2019t describe it.\u2033 \t   Joseph Bradehoft, 25, had recently moved into a Milwaukee apartment rented under his brother\u2019s name, Donald, and was looking for work. Bradehoft recently lived in Illinois and Minnesota, where he had a wife and three children. \t   Dahmer told police he met Bradehoft, carrying a six-pack of beer, at a bus stop. He said he offered him money to pose and Bradehoft came to his apartment for sex. Then the grisly pattern was repeated.

Bruno isn\u2019t convinced. \t   Some evidence indicates hate groups in the United States are becoming \u2033bigger and badder,\u2033 Bruno said, adding the Posse epitomized such groups with its loathing of Jews, blacks, taxes and government. \t   The group\u2019s activities petered out in Wisconsin because the leaders were silenced, the prosecutor said. \t   \u2033You cut off the head of a snake and the rest of the snake can worm around, but it can\u2019t bite you anymore,\u2033 he said. \t   The government considered the Posse dangerous lawbreakers, hatemongers and potential killers, something akin to organized crime. At least six Posse members have been convicted of crimes ranging from theft to tax evasion. \t   Wickstrom, 47, was sentenced Aug. 7 in Pennsylvania to 38 months in prison for conspiring to distribute $100,000 in counterfeit money.

Those shootouts left three federal marshals dead. \t   Residents link the origins of the Posse to a day in the late 1970s when Minniecheske dumped two loads of sand along a river for a swimming beach, said Tigerton Police Chief Charles Gehrman. State officials objected - he had no permit - and his outrage against the government interference fueled a movement. \t   Some residents said the Posse had legitimate complaints about government, but the wrong approach to solving them. \t   \u2033They had support until they started going crazy with stuff, when they started flashing those guns,\u2033 said Kevin Maas, a logger who remembers seeing at least one Posse member in town with a pistol strapped to his hip. \t   The Tigerton Dells Bar and Ranch - the Posse\u2019s headquarters and home for the Minniecheske family - still displays a large picture of the late U.S. Sen.

Using seeing-eye dogs and white canes, they then spread through congressional office buildings to lobby for the legislation. \t   The FAA proposed last March to prohibit blind or deaf passengers or passengers who might inhibit the use of an airliner emergency door from sitting in the exit row seats. The agency called the matter \u2033a critical safety issue\u2033 and said the rule would enhance the safety of all passengers. \t   FAA spokesman Dick Stafford said the agency is in the final rule-making procedure, which means it still could impose the rule as proposed, modify it or withdraw it. \t   Bob Marx, Transportation Department spokesman, said the department is expected to issue next month an access rule that would not preclude the FAA from imposing safety restrictions on seating. \t   Leaders of the National Federation of the Blind said the government actions would be discriminatory and decrease a blind person\u2019s chances of surviving an airplane crash. Some airlines already prohibit blind travelers from sitting in exit-door seats and several blind people have been arrested in recent years for refusing to move from the seats. \t   A half-dozen members of Congress expressed support for bills that would ban rules to bar passengers from certain based on whether the passenger can see.

Several hours later, Heather died at the same hospital. \t   It\u2019s difficult to say exactly what drove Miss Smith on Nov. 26, but she \u2033threw out a lot of signals,\u2033 says Pierce County sheriff\u2019s Deputy Rick Adamson, who interviewed some 30 teens after the shootings. \t   Earlier that day she told \u2033half a dozen to a dozen\u2033 classmates she planned to \u2033shoot Gordon\u2033 or \u2033get even with Gordon,\u2033 adding that \u2033people would remember her,\u2033 Adamson said. \t   \u2033But it\u2019s like the boy who cried, \u2019Wolf 3/8\u2034 he added. \u2033No one took her seriously.\u2033 \t   The breakup of Heather\u2019s \u2033puppy love\u2033 relationship with Pickett took place more than six weeks before the shooting, Adamson said. \t   \u2033It was real innocent ... not the end of a heavy romance,\u2033 he said. \u2033She told people she was upset about Gordon. She may have been more mature than Gordon ... The kids said Gordon just wanted to be friends - not boyfriend- girlfriend. \t   \u2033It\u2019s sad to see a lot of kids grow up overnight,\u2033 the 27-year-old Adamson added quietly. \t   The tragedy jolted sheriff\u2019s officers, but sheriff\u2019s chaplain Dan Nolta said he was amazed also \u2033by the incredible outpouring of love\u2033 among the Smith, Ricco and Pickett families. \t   As their children briefly clung to life, Chris\u2019 father, James Ricco, approached Army Warrant Officer Alan Smith and his wife, Brenda, to comfort them in the Madigan Army Medical Center intensive care unit, Nolta said. \t   \u2033We\u2019re all suffering our loss,\u2033 says Pickett\u2019s mother, Sandra Lauderdale, who also talked to the Smiths. \u2033They\u2019re probably suffering even more because of what their daughter did.\u2033      The Smiths flew to Anderson, Mo., on Monday to prepare for their daughter\u2019s burial later in the week. \t   Ms. Lauderdale described her son as a \u2033very, very happy, fun-loving boy\u2033 so busy with wrestling, soccer and Boy Scouts he hadn\u2019t the time to formally \u2033date\u2033 anyone, even Miss Smith, whom she called \u2033a nice girl.\u2033 \t   \u2033She had to be so troubled she didn\u2019t know what she was doing,\u2033 Ms. Lauderdale said. \t   A gymnastics team member who maintained a near-perfect 3.9 grade point average, Miss Smith had attempted suicide prior to the shootings, Adamson said, inflicting a superficial scratch on one wrist. He said he understood she was counseled at Madigan. \t   But confidentiality kept the Spanaway staff from knowing that, said Colleen Smith, a gifted education specialist for the Bethel school district called back to her old school to help students cope with the tragedy. She is not related to Heather Smith. \t   As classes for the school\u2019s 740 students resumed this week for the first time since the shootings, counselors talked to 50 to 75 youngsters, including five or six who were especially hard-hit, said counselor Paul Sevig. \t   \u2033The most common reaction was guilt - \u2018what if there was something I could have done?\u2019 \u2033 he said. \u2033We also talked to the kids Heather associated with that day - they were really feeling bad.\u2033 \t   \u2033Most of the grieving ... probably will not be known for days or weeks,\u2033 Principal Grant Hosford said. \u2033But I don\u2019t think anybody is now saying this is \u2018neat\u2019 or something anyone else wants to do.\u2033 \t   School authorities and law enforcement officers paint the case as isolated, not a symptom of how tough it is to be young in America. \t   \u2033I think these kids are going to be caring for each other more,\u2033 said Tom Johnson, a school psychologist. \u2033If the kids hear someone say, \u2018I might as well be dead,\u2019 they\u2019re going to pay a lot more attention.\u2033  ", "date": "1985-12-04T19:16:00Z"}]
