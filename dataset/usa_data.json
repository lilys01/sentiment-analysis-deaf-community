Blige in the 56-year-old game\u2019s first-ever hip-hop extravaganza.And so there Forbes will be\u00a0Feb. 13 at L.A.\u2019s SoFi Stadium, where he and fellow deaf rapper Warren (WaWa) Snipe will perform sign-language interpretations of the headliners\u2019 music.It\u2019s the first time the NFL has incorporated sign-language performances as part of the halftime program. Their American Sign Language (ASL) renditions, what the NFL describes as an elevated accessibility experience, will be viewable at NBCSports.com and the NBC Sports app.More:Is Eminem a shoo-in for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame this year? History suggests yes\u201cThe doors to accessibility are busted wide open with something like this,\u201d Forbes said.He\u00a0can\u2019t disclose\u00a0much about the closely guarded halftime set, but he does know he\u2019ll be accompanying the appearances of Eminem and Snoop. He heads to Los Angeles on Sunday for a week of rehearsals.Onstage, Forbes and Wawa aren\u2019t mere ASL interpreters. They\u2019re full-on performers, spirited and expressive, lending the music their own creative flourishes and artistry.Wawa has already made a Super Bowl mark, wowing audiences last February with his animated, elegant performance of the national anthem alongside Jazmine Sullivan and Eric Church, along with a rendition of \u201cAmerica\u00a0the Beautiful.\u201dFor Forbes, who turns 40 Saturday, there\u2019s some poetic symmetry in joining Eminem at the Super Bowl. He has a long connection to the Detroit hip-hop star \u2014 a link that began with his father, who was close to some of the folks inside Em\u2019s business and studio circles. Forbes was a regular at Ferndale's 54 Sound studio,\u00a0where Eminem cut much of his early work.Rock & Roll Hall of Fame 2022 nominees:Dolly Parton, Duran Duran, Eminem top varied lineup\u201cSo this is very much a full-circle moment, being from Detroit, being part of the Eminem camp \u2014 or even going back to being 12 and listening to N.W.A., Dre and Snoop on my Walkman,\u201d Forbes said.At 54 Sound in 2005, he got the chance to show Eminem a video of his intense ASL interpretation of \u201cLose Yourself\u201d \u2014 drawing a response Forbes often gets from hearing folks: \u201cDeaf people like music?\u201d\u00a0They do indeed, as Forbes has learned to explain, feeling the rhythm through bass vibrations and drawn to the lyricism of the words.\u201cThat was purely Sean Forbes trying to find an opportunity in the music industry,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t sure what that was yet.\u201dHe went on to help launch the Deaf Performing Arts Network (DPAN), which made a specialty out of ASL\u00a0interpretations of pop music hits and eventually made its way into news and information programming for the deaf.As a solo artist, Forbes carved out a name as one of the most significant figures\u00a0in the world of ASL performing, as he toured and collaborated with people\u00a0such as actress Marlee Matlin. His 2020 album \u201cLittle Victories\u201d topped the Amazon sales charts the week of release.Since getting the call-up from the NFL at the top of the year, Forbes was sworn to secrecy ahead of the NFL's pending announcement.More:Adele confirms Brit Awards performance, her first since postponing entire Vegas residencyHe chuckled to himself as friends texted the viral meme that sprang up when Matthew Stafford\u2019s Los Angeles Rams secured their spot in the big game.

African American artworks adorn the walls. Shelves are filled with literary tomes and African artifacts. Photographs, poetry and newspaper clippings of Black deaf heroes and heroines are prominently displayed. Offices have buttons that you push\u00a0to alert people you\u2019re outside the door, since a knock might\u00a0not be heard.Smith, 24, a communication studies major from Jackson, Mississippi, appears right at home. Sporting a blue hoodie, his sturdy brown hands dancing with expression, he explains\u00a0the nuances between American Sign Language ( ASL)\u00a0and Black American Sign Language.\u201cASL is more professional, and Black ASL is like that with some soul. It\u2019s like some good seasoning,\u201d he said with a broad grin. \u201cWe\u2019re vibing while we\u2019re signing. There\u2019s some hip-hop flair.\u201dSmith, a senior, has played football, run track, held student government roles and served as president of the Black Student Union at Gallaudet. He\u2019s among the 1,400 degree-seeking students enrolled at the private university with a mission to educate people who are deaf or hard of hearing.Officially chartered in 1864, with support from Congress and President Abraham Lincoln, the name honors Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, who co-founded America\u2019s first school for the deaf in Connecticut. His son, Edward Miner Gallaudet, was first principal of the school in Washington.Black History Month:In the crucible of historic change, I grew up Black and proudEducation:War protests, Black Panther Party: Yale alums reflect on Black student movement of 1970sAt Gallaudet's\u00a0first commencement in 1869, student diplomas were signed by President Ulysses S. Grant. All Gallaudet degrees are still signed by the commander in chief.\u00a0The leafy 99-acre site nestled in the nation\u2019s capital is a global beacon, one whose community hails from 50 states and nearly 100 countries, along with about 23,000 alumni. From visual learning and language, to full rights for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, the school has been preeminent in deaf achievement, history and knowledge for more than a century.Gallaudet has been a major force for change, helping to shatter perceptions about what deaf people contribute to society. Amid the nation\u2019s larger racial reckoning, Gallaudet's Black faculty, students and administrators are\u00a0flexing their collective power to push the university to more fully embrace its commitment to being diverse, bilingual and multicultural.The Center for Black Deaf Studies, which launched in 2020, is viewed by supporters as a critical part of that evolution.\u201cBlack deaf people have been actively engaged in improving their status in America for more than a century,\u201d said Carolyn McCaskill, a professor in the department of Deaf Studies and founding director of the center. \u201cWe collectively have the opportunity to commemorate and celebrate this courageous spirit. The center will operate as an outreach center for teaching and learning about the Black deaf experience.\u201dA linguistic minority, not disabledMcCaskill grew up in Mobile, Alabama, with several siblings who are deaf; others are hearing. She attended racially segregated deaf schools\u00a0before arriving at Gallaudet in the 1970s. After earning her bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s\u00a0and doctoral degrees at the university, she joined the faculty in 1996.McCaskill is among a few dozen Black deaf people in the USA who hold doctoral degrees. A pioneering scholar in the field of Black American Sign Language, she co-wrote the seminal book\u00a0\u201cThe Hidden Treasure of Black ASL: Its History and Structure.\u201d\u00a0It's\u00a0the first sociohistorical and linguistic study of Black ASL.\u201cWe don\u2019t see ourselves as disabled,\u201d she said. \u201cWe consider ourselves a linguistic minority. And like ASL, Black Sign Language is beautiful.\u201dThat remark elicits an affirmative response from Evon Black, a fellow Gallaudet alumna who is associate director of the center. Originally from Arkansas, Black is well known in tightknit Black deaf circles. She\u2019s a past president of the National Black Deaf Advocates, an organization that is at the forefront of fighting for civil rights and equal access to education, employment\u00a0and social services.\u201cWe are people, one and the same,\u201d Black said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misperceptions that people who are not deaf need to fix us, and that\u2019s not the case. We don\u2019t need that. We need accommodations\u201d\u00a0\u2013 be it qualified interpreters in schools, workplaces or situations involving law enforcement. She noted that amid the COVID-19 pandemic, small acts, such as\u00a0briefly pulling down one\u2019s mask so a deaf person might read lips or see facial expressions, aid in communication.'Unity without uniformity':50 years later, ideology of 1972 National Black Political Convention still resonatesOperation Breadbasket:How a 1966 economic boycott plan became Jesse Jackson's signature programAfter nearly 30 years at the university, Black helps manage the center\u2019s broad portfolio: planning seminars, lectures, conferences and workshops;\u00a0supporting outreach activities;\u00a0and administering grants.She\u2019s working on a special university project, a historic yet long overlooked milestone for Gallaudet and the nation. It\u2019s a forthcoming memorial, the \u201cLouise B. Miller Pathways and Gardens: A Legacy to Black Deaf Children.\u201dMiller's story is powerful. In 1952, the Washington mother of four \u2013 three deaf sons and one hearing daughter \u2013 was angered by the city\u2019s biased regulations that forced parents such as her to send their Black deaf children away \u2013 at their expense \u2013 to segregated public schools in neighboring states. She and other parents filed suit in federal court against the D.C. Board of Education on behalf of her son, Kenneth, and other Black deaf children.On July 3, 1952, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in their favor, stating that African Americans could not be sent outside a state or district to obtain the same education that white students could have within the state or district.The ruling led to the opening in 1953 of a school division for Black deaf students in grades K-12 on the Gallaudet\u00a0campus, separate from a division for white deaf primary-grade students and taught by a handful of dedicated Black teachers.The university awarded Miller a posthumous honorary degree in May 2021.\u201cLouise Miller is right up there with more celebrated people like Rosa Parks,\u201d said Gallaudet alum\u00a0Allan \u201cAJ\u201d Williams. \u201cShe was a heroine.\u201d\u00a0Controversies on campusThe center and memorial development are not happening in a vacuum. In recent years, allegations from some students of discriminatory treatment have rankled the Gallaudet community. There\u2019s been outrage over a since-suspended fraternity whose ceremonial garb was deemed too similar to KKK robes\u00a0and over old photos with frat salutes decried as antisemitic that surfaced on social media.Some board of trustee members resigned, dissatisfied with how the university has addressed equity issues.\u00a0Gallaudet President\u00a0Roberta \u201cBobbi\u201d Cordano \u2013 the first deaf woman and first openly LGBTQ person to steward the university \u2013 has publicly addressed concerns. The university website noted the school has embarked upon \u201ccontinuous and evolving\u201d actions, including a formal anti-racism statement that racism \u201ccontradicts and is incompatible\u201d with Gallaudet\u2019s mission and values.\u00a0Elizabeth Moore, a Black deaf Gallaudet alum, was named interim chief diversity officer in August 2020\u00a0to oversee\u00a0the division of Equity, Diversity\u00a0and Inclusion. She is\u00a0 responsible for carrying out anti-racism goals.\u201cRacism is something we need to address in the deaf community,\u201d Moore said. Many Black deaf people, she said, have dealt with \u201clayers\u201d of oppression. \u201cIt happens when people fail to recognize the level of diversity in the community.\u201dReginald Bess, a Georgia-born doctoral student in educational leadership at Gallaudet, said that while teaching, he often encountered deaf students who\u2019d never seen a Black man in the classroom. \u201cWe have to open people\u2019s minds,\u201d he said.An exhibit in the university\u2019s museum highlights weeklong protests in 1988 during the \u201cDeaf President Now\u201d (DPN) movement. Before those student and alumni demonstrations, the university had never selected a deaf leader. The marches and rallies led to the appointment of\u00a0I. King Jordan, a Gallaudet alum.\u201cThe problem is not that the students do not hear,\u201d civil rights leader Jesse Jackson wrote in an excerpt of a\u00a0letter of solidarity shown in the exhibit. \u201cThe problem is that the hearing world does not listen.\u201dSmith, an assistant at the center, hopes to shift that dynamic. In 2019, he and fellow students collaborated on a rendition of Martin Luther King Jr.'s iconic \u201cI Have a Dream\" speech in American Sign Language; the YouTube video posted in 2020\u00a0went viral.Slated to graduate this year, Smith hopes to use his education and platform to impact the \u201cnext generation\u201d of Black deaf youth, as well as others.\u201cI want to be a voice to effect change and propel change in the world,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/reviewed/2022/01/10/reviewed-launches-new-focus-accessibility-and-aging/9134353002/", "headline": "Reviewed launches new vertical dedicated to accessibility", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 8:58 a.m. ET Jan. 10, 2022 Updated: 9:10 a.m. ET Jan. 10, 2022", "text": "\u2014 Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed\u2019s editors.

They are an agricultural operation in which privately owned members of the Family Cervidae (deer) are held in captivity.The deer, which they named \u201cPie,\u201d for its\u00a0unique coloring, spent a lot of time in their home but now roams a 3-acre, fenced-in area.A year later, Petricone said his wife realized they enjoyed having deer as pets so much that they decided to have more. They found someone with a young buck, and it didn\u2019t take long before the deer reproduced. Now they have six whitetails, and five of them have the white piebald genetic traits.Albino deer are all white and lack pigmentation in their hooves and eyes. The piebald genetic abnormality can create defects \u2014 three of this family\u2019s deer becoming deaf.He said the deaf deer are calm and gentle as they aren\u2019t as easily spooked as normal deer that have sensitive hearing.\u201cThey are all very gentle,\"\u00a0Petricone said.\u00a0\u201cYou can pet every one of them; they\u2019ll come up. The grandkids love them. They can put their arms around their heads.\"\u2026 They actually make great pets but only if you put the time in and bottle raise them and raise them up from fawns yourself.\u201dThe deer are playful in the yard and he said it\u2019s easy to create a bond with them. He recalled\u00a0when the deer used an old tarp to play on similar to a children\u2019s slip and slide. \u201cThey\u2019re fun animals,\u201d he said.To help keep the deer safe from coyotes and bear that may try to navigate through the fence, they have two herding type dogs, an Anatolian and a Kangal, that watch over the small herd.They\u2019ve grown attached to the deer as each one has different markings and personality. \u201cThey are interesting looking,\u201d he said about the piebalds\u00a0but wished they didn\u2019t have genetic defects. \u201cNature takes its own course. ... Each one gets its\u00a0own special attention.\u201dThe deer have reproduced and some offspring are piebalds. When they have too many, they are able to sell them to other licensed handlers. One time he traded a somewhat aggressive buck to a fisherman for some seafood. \u201cI traded him for one tuna, 20 lobsters and 30 pounds of shark meat,\u201d\u00a0Petricone said.Due to strict state regulations on captive deer, they have a sturdy fence around 3 acres of their property to prevent the deer from escaping. With concerns about Chronic Wasting Disease in deer,\u00a0Petricone said, if animals escaped they would have to be euthanized to prevent a possible conflict with the wild population.While the deer are unique pets in themselves, the family also has a propagation permit through the Pennsylvania Game Commission for gray fox. They have two foxes, named Taz and Tildy, that sometimes spend time in their home like more traditional pets. One is 9 and the other is 8, and they raised them from pups.For those thinking about owning a deer, Petricone said to do your research and visit a place that is licensed to have deer. He said it can be expensive purchasing the feed and paying for vet bills for deer.\u201cThey\u2019re eating constantly,\u201d he said.\u201cThink about how much work and time you can devote to it,\"\u00a0Petricone\u00a0said about the never-ending commitment it takes to care for large animals. \"It\u2019s got to be something you really want. \u2026 Don\u2019t get it unless you\u00a0really want it bad.\u201dHe also suggests starting with a doe. The bucks become aggressive in the early fall when the mating season approaches.Brian Whipkey is the outdoor columnist for USA TODAY Network sites in Pennsylvania.

In her roughly 10 minutes of screen time, you can't take your eyes off the captivating, pretzel-limbed\u00a0Hunter, whose gravelly voice and continual shape-shifting\u00a0make her a kooky presence that looms over the entire film.\u00a0Rob Morgan ('Don't Look Up')Don't look now but Morgan's steadily built an intriguing resume, from \"Mudbound\" and \"Greyhound\" to, of all things, \"Stranger Things.\" You might recognize his face \u2013 now get to know his name: Amid a sea of A-listers in Adam McKay's end-of-the-world\u00a0satire, Morgan rises above as an embattled yet steady-handed government official trying to maintain sanity in an insane scenario.Jesse Plemons ('The Power of the Dog')\"The Power of the Dog\" stars Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst and Kodi Smit-McPhee have deservedly earned the bulk of recognition from critics and industry awards so far this season.

Then it's like, \"What?\"The very nature of the imperfect awards competition means seminal performances, movies\u00a0and songs are annually\u00a0left off the final Oscar ballot. But this crop of\u00a0overlooked nominees is especially noticeable\u00a0in a\u00a0pandemic-affected awards season where great movies lacked audience oxygen and momentum shifts were even more unpredictable.Oscar nominations:'The Power of the Dog' leads with 12, Kristen Stewart nabs first nodHere are the top contenders who sadly missed out, and who will not be vying for Oscar glory on March 27.Lady GagaLady Gaga, 35, was a\u00a0high profile front-runner for a best actress nomination for her role as Patrizia Reggiani in \"House of Gucci\" right up until Oscar nominations morning. However, the Oscar winner for best song in \"A Star Is Born\" was not announced in the best actress category.Ben AffleckBen Affleck, 49, was in awards contention for two roles, supporting actor for director George Clooney's \"The Tender Bar\" and as a haughty French baron in director Ridley Scott's \"The Last Duel.\" But Affleck, 49, was shut out in both categories.Leonardo DiCaprioThe A-lister is\u00a0at his most academically unglamorous as the comet-warning Dr. Randall Mindy in \"Don't Look Up,\"\u00a0writer-director Adam McKay's polarizing statement film on global warming. Despite earning a Golden Globe and\u00a0British Academy of Film Television and Arts\u00a0nominations for the role, Leonardo DiCaprio, 47, who won his best actor statue for \"The Revenant\" in 2016, missed out on his seventh acting\u00a0Oscar nomination. \"Don't Look Up\" earned four nominations, including best original screenplay and best picture.Jennifer HudsonAt 25, Jennifer Hudson became the youngest Black woman to win an acting Oscar for her stunning movie debut as Effie White in 2006\u2019s \"Dreamgirls.\"\u00a0Hudson was the hand-chosen pick of Aretha Franklin to play the Queen of Soul\u00a0in her biopic \u201cRespect\u201d and her standout performance put Hudson, now 40, in the best actress race and in best original song competition\u00a0\"Here I Am (Singing\u00a0My Way Home).\" But Hudson couldn't crack either\u00a0the best actress nominations or best song.Oscar nominations failed to build on diversity\u00a0momentum:What needs to happen next.Rachel ZeglerThe brightest light in director Steven Spielberg's \"West Side Story,\"\u00a020-year-old Rachel Zegler has exploded into Hollywood in her film debut as Maria Vasquez. The first Latina actress to win a Golden Globe award for best actress, Zegler was not able to break\u00a0into the Oscar best actress category. At least not this\u00a0year.\u00a0\"West Side Story\" received seven nominations, including for best picture, best director\u00a0and supporting actress for Ariana DeBose.'We Don't Talk About Bruno' is a No. 1 hit:Why isn't the 'Encanto' song up for an Oscar?Peter Dinklage\u00a0The four-time Emmy-winning \"Game of Thrones\" actor has received glowing reviews as thwarted lover and wordsmith\u00a0Cyrano de Bergerac in\u00a0director Joe Wright's sumptuous, but little-seen \"Cyrano,\" but was not able to break into the highly competitive best actor\u00a0race.\u00a0\"Cyrano\" was nominated for best costume design.'House of Gucci'\u00a0The awards light has burned brightly on \"House of Gucci,\" which earned\u00a0a Screen Actors Guild nomination for best ensemble cast, with\u00a0Jared Leto and Lady Gaga earning individual SAG acting nominations. But the Ridley Scott-directed\u00a0drama, which everyone and their grandmother is talking about, received\u00a0mixed reviews overall.\u00a0\"House of Gucci\" couldn't crack into any of the major acting categories\u00a0and was denied a best picture nomination.\u00a0\"House of Gucci\" earned just one Oscar nomination for makeup and hairstyling.'Spider-Man: No Way Home'With stellar reviews and boffo box office at $1.77\u00a0billion\u00a0worldwide, couldn't we dream about a best picture nomination for Tom Holland's \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\"? Isn't that why the best picture category was expanded to 10 films, to ensure that fan favorite\u00a0and comic book films\u00a0like \"Joker\" and \"Black Panther\" had a crack at Oscar love? \"Spider-Man\" swung and missed, though it did nab\u00a0a nomination for best visual effects.Nicolas Cage\u00a0The idea that\u00a0Nicolas Cage was in a celebrated movie, and even in Oscar discussion, had the makings of a great comeback story.\u00a0The 58-year-old actor\u00a0earned raves for his \"Pig\" role as a truffle hunter looking for his beloved, kidnapped pig. But this story ended, sadly, without an Oscar best actor nomination for Cage, who took home an Oscar in 1996 for \"Leaving Las Vegas.\"Bradley CooperBradley Cooper\u00a0returned to the awards race with vigor after leading his directorial debut,\u00a02018's \"A Star Is Born,\" to eight Oscar nominations. Cooper was the beating, dark heart in the center of Guillermo del Toro's\u00a0\"Nightmare Alley\" and went full-tilt crazy in a movie-stealing supporting role as producer Jon Peters in \"Licorice Pizza.\" Cooper was denied a nomination in both categories, though scored a best picture nomination as a producer on \"Alley.\"Jared LetoEven for a lightning-rod performer like Jared Leto, his\u00a0latex-enhanced, hammy performance as\u00a0Paolo Gucci in \"House of Gucci\" epitomized a polarizing film performance. Lauded with a SAG best supporting actor nomination in January, Leto earned an unwanted\u00a0Razzie Award nomination for the same role this week. The \"Dallas Buyers Club\" Oscar winner\u00a0missed out on a best supporting actor nomination for the second year in a row after being denied\u00a0for last year's \"The Little Things\" following a surprise awards run.Caitriona BalfeIrish actress and \"Outlander\" breakout star Caitriona Balfe was an awards season\u00a0front-runner for her supporting actress role as Ma\u00a0in\u00a0director Kenneth Branagh's \"Belfast.\" The film earned an impressive seven nominations Tuesday, including best director, best picture\u00a0and best supporting actress/actor nods for Judi Dench and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds. However,\u00a0Balfe was sadly overlooked.Marlee MatlinAfter insisting on acting alongside deaf actors\u00a0in the celebrated \"CODA,\" a comedic drama centered around a singing Child of Deaf Adults, Matlin has earned raves for her performance as coolest mother ever Jackie Rossi. But\u00a0the first deaf actor to win an Academy Award in 1987 for\u00a0\"Children of a Lesser God\"\u00a0did not receive a nomination for the\u00a02022 Oscar best supporting actress race.\u00a0Her onscreen husband, Troy Kotsur, made history as the first male deaf actor to be nominated for an Oscar for \"CODA,\" which also earned a best picture nomination.Why Marlee Matlin put her foot down:She insisted 'CODA' cast deaf actorsRita MorenoRita Moreno returned to the movie that brought her to Oscar glory, \"West Side Story.\" Her role as Anita in the 1961\u00a0original musical was a landmark victory, making her the first Hispanic woman to win an Oscar. The Puerto Rican-born legend, 90, has gone on to earn the rare EGOT,\u00a0with additional Emmy, Grammy and Tony wins. However, Moreno could not earn a second \"West Side Story\" nomination with her new role\u00a0as drugstore owner Valentina in\u00a0Steven Spielberg's celebrated remake.Jay-Z\u00a0The Netflix Western \"The Harder They Fall\"\u00a0not only featured Jay-Z as producer\u00a0but the rapper also collaborated with Kid Cudi in\u00a0\u201cGuns Go Bang\" on the film's soundtrack.\u00a0However,\u00a0the power duo couldn't muster enough bang to earn a best original song nomination. It was still a good morning in his household: His wife Beyonce was nominated for her original \"King Richard\" song, \"Be Alive,\" marking her first nomination.Ruth NeggaRuth Negga, who earned an Oscar nomination for 2016's \"Loving,\" was a strong contender for supporting actress in the Netflix drama \"Passing.\" After earning a SAG Award nomination last month, Negga, along with the movie\u00a0\"Passing,\" were thwarted in Oscar nominations.'Sing 2'The animated sequel to the 2016 original \"Sing\" featured a returning voice cast\u00a0that included Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon and\u00a0Scarlett Johansson along with a contending song by U2's Bono and the Edge, \"Your Song Saved My Life.\" But neither the animated film nor the song earned nominationsOscar nominations 2022: 'The Power of the Dog' leads with 12, Kristen Stewart nabs first nod Snubbed!

The organization announced in\u00a0September 2020 that\u00a0it would implement new diversity and inclusion standards for the best picture race in 2024.A USA TODAY analysis of last year's best picture nominees found it's not that difficult to pull off adhering to the academy's upcoming standards, even if a film doesn't have a diverse cast.

She was always absolutely sure of what they wanted to read \u2014 and, perhaps more important, what they didn\u2019t want to read \u2014 and yet she managed to surprise them with every book.\"A widow with five children in her late 30s, she became a perennial best-seller over the second half of her life, writing or co-writing \"A Stranger Is Watching,\" \"Daddy's Little Girl\" and more than 50 other favorites. Sales topped 100 million copies and honors came from all over, whether a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters in France or a \"Grand Master\" statuette back home from the Mystery Writers of America. Many of her books, including \"A Stranger is Watching\" and \"Lucky Day,\" were adapted for movies and television. She also collaborated on\u00a0several novels\u00a0with her daughter, Carol Higgins Clark.Mary Higgins Clark specialized in women triumphing over danger, such as the besieged young prosecutor in \"Just Take My Heart\" or the mother of two and art gallery worker whose second husband is a madman in \"A Cry in the Night.\" Mary Clark's goal as an author was simple, if rarely easy: keep the readers reading.Her last book:At 91, Mary Higgins Clark pens #MeToo book 'Kiss the Girls and Make Them Cry'\"You want to turn the page,\" she told The Associated Press in 2013. \"There are wonderful sagas you can thoroughly enjoy a section and put it down. But if you're reading my book, I want you stuck with reading the next paragraph. The greatest compliment I can receive is, 'I read your darned book 'til 4 in the morning, and now I'm tired.' I say, 'Then you get your money's worth.'\"Her own life taught her lessons of resilience, strengthened by her Catholic faith, that she shared with her fictional heroines. She was born Mary Higgins in New York City in 1927, the second of three children. She would later take on the last name Clark after marriage. Mary Clark's father ran a popular pub that did well enough for the family to afford a maid and for her mother to prepare meals for strangers in need. But business slowed during the Great Depression and her father, forced to work ever longer hours as he laid off employees, died in his sleep in 1939. One of her brothers died of meningitis a few years later. Surviving family members took on odd jobs and had to rent out rooms in the house.Mary had always loved to write. At age 6, she completed her first poem, which her mother proudly requested she recite in front of the family. A story she wrote in grade school impressed her teacher enough that Mary Clark read it to the rest of the class. By high school, she was trying to sell stories to True Confessions magazine.After working as a hotel switchboard operator (Tennessee Williams was among the guests she eavesdropped on) and a flight attendant for Pan American, she married Warren Clark, the regional manager of Capital Airways, in 1949. Throughout the 1950s and into the '60s, she raised the children, studied writing at New York University and began getting stories published. Some drew upon her experiences at Pan American. One story which appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, \"Beauty Contest at Buckingham Palace,\" imagined a pageant featuring Queen Elizabeth II, Jackie Kennedy and Princess Grace of Monaco. But by the mid-60s, the magazine market for fiction was rapidly shrinking and her husband's health was failing; Warren Clark died of a heart attack in 1964.Mary Clark quickly found work as a script writer for \"Portrait of a President,\" a radio series on American presidents. Her research inspired her first book, a historical novel about George and Martha Washington. She was so determined that she began getting up at 5 a.m., working until nearly 7, then feeding her children and leaving for work.\"Aspire to the Heavens\" was published in 1969. It was \"a triumph,\" she recalled in her memoir \"Kitchen Privileges,\" but also a folly. The publisher was sold near the book's release and received little attention. She regretted the title and learned that some stores placed the book in religious sections. Her compensation was $1,500, minus commission. (The novel was reissued decades later, far more successfully, as \"Mount Vernon: A Love Story\").For her next book, she wanted to make some money. Following a guideline she would often suggest to other writers, she looked at her bookshelves, which featured novels by Agatha Christie, Rex Stout and other mystery writers, and decided she should write the kind of book she liked to read. A recent tabloid trial, about a young woman accused of murdering her children, gave her an idea.\"It seemed inconceivable to most of us that any woman could do that to her children,\" Mary Clark wrote in her memoir. \"And then I thought: Suppose an innocent young mother is convicted of the deliberate murder of her two children; suppose she gets out of prison on a technicality; and then suppose seven years to the day, on her 32nd birthday, the children of her second marriage disappear.\"In September 1974, she sent her agent a manuscript for \"Die a Little Death,\" acquired months later by Simon & Schuster for $3,000. Renamed \"Where are the Children?\" and released in 1975, it became her first-best seller and began her long, but not entirely surprising run of success. She would allege that a psychic had told her she would become rich and famous.Mary Clark, who wrote well into her 90s, more than compensated for her early struggles. She acquired several homes and for a time owned part of the New Jersey Nets. She was among a circle of authors, including Lee Child and Nelson DeMille, who met regularly for dinner in Manhattan. She also had friends in Washington and was a White House guest during the administrations of the Clintons and of both President George H.W. Bush, whose wife Barbara became a close friend, and President George W. Bush.Married since 1996 to former Merrill Lynch Futures CEO John J. Conheeney, she remembered well the day she said goodbye to hard times. It was in April of 1977, and her agent had told her that Simon & Schuster was offering $500,000 for the hardcover to her third novel, \"A Stranger is Watching,\" and that the publisher Dell was paying $1 million for the paperback. She had been running her own script production company during the day and studying for a philosophy degree at Fordham University at night, returning home to New Jersey in an old car with more than 100,000 miles on it.\"As I drove onto the Henry Hudson Parkway, the tailpipe and muffler came loose and began dragging on the ground. For the next 21 miles, I kur-plunked, kur-plunked, all the way home,\" she wrote in her memoir. \"People in other cars kept honking and beeping, obviously sure that I was either too stupid or too deaf to hear the racket.\u201cThe next day I bought a Cadillac!\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/02/02/sound-metal-awards-season-contender-mixed-deaf-community/4248898001/", "headline": "'Sound of Metal' awards season contender mixed with deaf community", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 11:00 a.m. ET Feb. 2, 2021 Updated: 12:48 p.m. ET Feb. 3, 2021", "text": "Riz Ahmed's performance as Ruben, a\u00a0drummer who loses his hearing, in \"Sound of Metal\"\u00a0has earned rave reviews from critics and audiences alike \u2013 not to mention praise from the deaf community, something difficult for a hearing actor to achieve.Ahmed has been nominated for a Golden Globe and\u00a0already won best actor\u00a0at the Gotham Independent Film Awards and the National Board of Review, and Paul Raci, who plays his deaf mentor Joe, has picked up several similarly smaller-scale supporting actor wins\u00a0as well. Ahmed and Raci have also been generating\u00a0Oscar buzz.\u00a0It's clear that \"Sound of Metal\" did the work to respect the deaf community, though left room for improvement \u2013 and sparked a critical conversation about representing the deaf community in Hollywood.The audience embarks\u00a0on an auditory journey with Ruben. His simple ability to rock out loud and proud on the drums crumbles when he loses his hearing out of nowhere.In case you missed:How Riz Ahmed worked to honor deaf culture in 'Sound of Metal'\"It was so clear, and to the point with how deaf individuals navigate the world without language accessibility,\"\u00a0Isidore\u00a0Niyongabo, president of the executive board of the National Black Deaf Advocates, tells USA TODAY.Donna L. Sorkin, the executive director of the American Cochlear Implant Alliance, says\u00a0that Ruben's portrayal of losing his hearing was close to what many have experienced.Ruben spends time embedded in the deaf community and learns sign language. He ultimately decides to receive a cochlear implant, an electronic\u00a0device meant to help him regain his hearing. But his hearing doesn't sound like it used to; it sounds\u00a0metallic.\"That wasn't the case for me, but it's different for everybody,\" Sorkin says. \"And a lot of people, including scientists in the field said\u00a0that was really accurate.\"Ahmed, who spent seven months learning American Sign Language in preparation for the role,\u00a0told USA TODAY late last year it would've been impossible to represent everyone.\u00a0Ahmed wore auditory blockers during filming.\u00a0\"The thing I realized very quickly in researching this world is there is no representing hearing loss at large,\" he said at the time. \"Hearing loss is a unique experience that\u2019s different for everyone.\"\u00a0And another:How Riz Ahmed's 'Sound of Metal' aims to bridge important gap between hearing audiences, deaf communitySorkin took issue with some of the plot points surrounding Ruben's surgery. For example: The doctor in the film tells Ruben his cochlear implants aren't covered by health insurance, but according to the FDA as of 2004, \"more than 90 percent of all commercial health plans cover cochlear implants.\"\u00a0Also, Ruben swiftly experiences\u00a0rejection from the deaf community. That's not how it necessarily would've gone down, according to experts, though cochlear implants are a sore subject.\u00a0Not every ex-hearing person wants to become hearing again,\u00a0Niyongabo says. He wishes the film could have been more focused on deafness as diversity rather than deafness as disability.\"We are not broken,\" Niyongabo says. \"We are deaf, and my disability as a deaf person is a hearing person\u2019s inability to understand my language.\"Ahmed previously told USA TODAY: \"Ruben swings between seeing deafness as a loss and a disability and realizing that deafness is actually a culture and an opportunity to connect more deeply with himself and others.\"To that end, \"There\u2019s a complete disconnect between the deaf community and Hollywood,\" Nanci Linke-Ellis,\u00a0who has spent\u00a0decades on deaf accessibility and inclusion in film, said on a panel in October of last year.\u00a0\"It\u2019s a work in progress. Films like this help progress it.\"Hollywood can (and should be)\u00a0thinking about more effective inclusion. For example, if you're going to show sign language, don't cut the signs short, Niyongabo says, noting\u00a0when Ruben starts signing his name and the audience only sees him spell the letter \"R,\" it hinders the\u00a0deaf perspective of the scene.Adrienne Gravish, a deaf associate consultant and artist, wishes the camera would've stopped going out of focus.\u00a0She hoped to witness deeper connections characters were making instead of losing out on signed conversations.That said: \"I think it's the only movie that I've ever seen that has a balanced perspective, both from a hearing perspective, as well as deaf perspective,\"\u00a0Niyongabo says.\u00a0Jeremy Lee Stone, who played an ASL teacher in the movie,\u00a0assisted hearing director Darius Marder during filming.Howard\u00a0A. Rosenblum, CEO and Director of Legal Services for the National Association of the Deaf,\u00a0says that Hollywood must establish expectations, standards\u00a0and inclusion riders to ensure employment of deaf actors, directors and\u00a0writers.Casting a hearing person in the role of Joe\u00a0didn't go over well for some in the community, which Raci has acknowledged. He is the child of deaf adults (CODA), however.\u00a0\"I hear people saying, why is this hearing guy playing a deaf role?\" Raci told IndieWire. \"And my role, too! So (Ahmed) and I are gonna get some flak. The thing is, there\u2019s the deaf world (and)\u00a0there\u2019s the hearing world. What you call these people that you see in the movie, they\u2019re culturally deaf like my parents. (Ahmed), Ruben, is not culturally deaf. He\u2019s a hearing guy who lost his hearing; same thing with Joe.\"Even so, Gravish\u00a0wants Hollywood to become comfortable letting deaf people play themselves.Calls for more inclusion came up during a Q&A for the movie \"CODA\" at this year's Sundance Film Festival.\u00a0\"We need to hire more deaf actors. Simple as that,\" Oscar winner Marlee Matlin, who stars in the movie, said, later adding they should be men and women of all colors.Contributing: Andrea MandellSundance 2021:'CODA' star Marlee Matlin talks inclusion, calls on Hollywood to 'hire more deaf actors'"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/01/29/sundance-2021-marlee-matlin-coda-star-deaf-community-inclusion/4299533001/", "headline": "At Sundance, 'CODA' star Marlee Matlin talks deaf community ...", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 12:22 a.m. ET Jan. 29, 2021 Updated: 2:23 p.m. ET Feb. 7, 2021", "text": "If you aren't crying by the end of \"CODA,\" we're not sure what to do with you.The film, written and directed by\u00a0Si\u00e2n Heder (\"Tallulah\") is the story of 17-year-old Ruby (Emilia Jones), the hearing child of deaf parents (Oscar-winner\u00a0Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur), who's caught between helping her family's fledgling fish business in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and pursuing her singing aspirations in college. \u00a0It took home the U.S. Grand Jury Prize for drama at\u00a0the\u00a0Sundance Film Festival\u00a0on Jan. 28.Propelled by its powerful inclusivity of the deaf community, it's a refreshing reboot of the traditional teen romance and coming-of-age story.

I've actually carried on learning it, too.\"Sign language was obviously an integral part of the film, but it was behind the camera as well.\u00a0\"There was zero barriers on the set,\" Matlin said through an interpreter. \"(Heder) really immersed herself into our culture and made every attempt to learn and to work with us and having two directors of sign language on the set, plus interpreters, plus the crew who learned our language, everyone working together, it was working like on any other set, but the sign language aspect made it extra special.\"Heder added: \"We were signing on set when there were no deaf actors on set.\"Sign language was a crucial part of the comedy in the film \u2013 especially when Ruby's father tries and give his daughter a sex talk.Awards season buzz:'Nomadland,' 'One Night in Miami' among top movies in American Film Institute honors\"It was dirtier and dirtier,\" Heder said. \"The signs were more and more explicit.

But\u00a0Director and writer\u00a0Darius Marder\u00a0told The Hollywood Reporter it took 13 years\u00a0to make \"Sound of Metal\" due to a series of hardships, including being mugged and a back injury.\u00a0Ahmed spoke by phone to The Desert Sun\u00a0about his role in \"Sound of Metal\" and the film's bittersweet ending.\u00a0The following interview was edited for length and clarity.THE DESERT SUN: For \"Sound of Metal,\" you not only\u00a0learned how to play drums but also American Sign Language. Was it difficult to learn\u00a0both\u00a0for this role?\u00a0RIZ AHMED: It was definitely a challenge to learn those skills, but I find the challenge is often worth the gifts. The things that were massive obstacles for me ended up being the thing that really opened me up as an actor. I think both drumming and ASL are kinds of non-verbal communication. And as someone who's used to communicating a lot through words, whether in music or whatever, I really was forced to inhabit my body in a different way.\u00a0Did anything surprise you\u00a0throughout that learning experience?\u00a0I really enjoyed getting my own sign name. (Visual artist)\u00a0Christine\u00a0Sun Kim's son gave me my own sign name. It's really an example of how rich, elegant and complex American Sign Language is.I kept hesitating and messing up my words, and I didn't know how to give a sign for \"I'm thinking\" and just kept signing the words \"F\u2014k up.\" So, he gave me my sign name, which is half of the sign for \"F\u2014k up.\" (It) is a two-handed sign but he rendered it into a one-handed sign with three fingers to portray the letters R-I-Z and also added on a little twist at the end, which is the symbol of someone playing drums.So, it's like \"Riz the\u00a0F\u2014k up\u00a0who's preparing for this role of being the drummer.\" It's a pretty cool sign name and I'm proud of it.\u00a0Do you think you'll continue to learn sign language?\u00a0I'd love to. I haven't been able to spend as much time or be in contact as much with deaf friends and acquaintances, or spend much time with anyone because of\u00a0COVID-19, but it's certainly something I would to maintain and hold on to. I'd recommend anyone who's thinking about it to take it up. It teaches you more than just the language; it\u00a0teaches you about yourself. I would say it's forcing you to communicate from such a visceral, physical and embodied place.\u00a0The ending of the film is beautiful but feels conflicting. How do you feel about it?The best endings of films in my mind are the bittersweet ones. Hopefully, it's an ending as complex as the movie itself and as good as the movie itself.\u00a0As a rapper and musician, was it fun to bring your love of music to this role?Yeah, I think so. I feel like I want to bring more of myself to everything I do\u00a0and being able to bring\u00a0some of that love for music into this role created\u00a0a point of connection.\u00a0As a Muslim and an actor, you've been very vocal about the roles you and other Muslim actors play in Hollywood. The list of well-known Muslim actors\u00a0isn't very long;\u00a0do you see Hollywood opening up more opportunities for Muslim actors in the future?\u00a0(The list of Muslim actors) is tremendous, though.\u00a0But maybe the list of\u00a0Muslim actors\u00a0given the same shot as white counterparts might be a lot shorter. But I think it goes beyond just thinking about Muslims, Black people, East Asian people or disabled people.\u00a0It's about how broad our culture is and reflects how broad our mind is.\u00a0When we stretch culture, I think we also stretch\u00a0consciousness. It's not just that we could\u00a0do a better job in the film industry or the western film industry to broaden our horizons, I think we'd do\u00a0better for humanity if we were a bit more inclusive.\u00a0Are you surprised by the acclaim that \"Sound of Metal\" has received?In a way, it's always kind of a surprise\u00a0but, at the same time, I always felt like this was a special film. I'm glad that (director\u00a0Darius Marder) put\u00a013 years of effort toward\u00a0something so innovative in terms of the story, the lives he's portraying and the sound design. It's just a really cool piece of work.

He was in the intersection, trying to make a left turn, when a car without headlights struck him. \u00a0Both cars were damaged but still operable. The drivers pulled into a McDonald\u2019s parking lot and the other driver apparently called Westland police. An officer tried to communicate with Culver through written notes after ignoring his card for a person knowing sign language.\u201cMr. Culver\u2019s lip-reading skills are very weak,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cMr. Culver\u2019s ability to read written English likewise is very weak.

Mr. Culver communicates best using mime, gesture\u00a0and sign language.\u201dCulver received a $155 ticket\u00a0for\u00a0running a red light.While the other driver apparently drove away in his vehicle, an officer called a tow truck to move Culver\u2019s car to an impound lot. As far as Culver could tell, no one told him he could have waited until sunrise to drive the car to a service station or made his own arrangements to tow the car less expensively.Culver said he tried to ask the officers in writing where his car was being towed and what he needed to to do to get it back.\u201cOn information and belief, neither officer tried to tell Mr. Culver where his car was being towed or what he needed to do to get it back,\u201d the complaint stated. \u201cIf one of the officers tried to tell Mr. Culver where his car was being towed or what he needed to do to get it back, Mr. Culver did not understand.\u201dThe city, police department, police chief and a detective are still dealing with a January lawsuit because of a dismissed felony armed robbery.In that complaint, James Herrera, a man of Black and Hispanic descent, claims Westland police\u00a0arrested him without probable cause, singled him out for refusing to cooperate with another investigation and conspired to punish him for not cooperating.The suit started in Wayne County\u2019s Third Circuit Court and moved last week to \u00a0U.S. District Court. \u00a0Contact reporter Susan Vela at svela@hometownlife.com or 248-303-8432.

He did a number of jobs that included attaching steering wheels on the Model A.Now Brick, 41, is part of a team doing final advanced prototyping. Not only would these be helpful to hearing-impaired people but Ford also learned that children with autism have a harder time communicating when they can\u2019t see facial expressions.Reusable N95 respirators\u00a0could\u00a0provide medical protection as well as ease demand for\u00a0disposable masks\u00a0and reduce waste, he said.Ford plans to do continued testing this winter in hopes of making the masks available in the spring.

Look at what we've dealt with the last four years. From here, it's only up,\u201d said disability rights leader Rebecca Cokley, who directed the National Council on Disability during the Obama administration.\u00a0The White House revamped its website when Biden entered office, prioritizing accessibility features and bringing back a Spanish-language version. Upon visiting WhiteHouse.gov,\u00a0users with visual, processing and other disabilities will be able to use toggles\u00a0on the home page to adjust font size and contrast.\"This commitment to accessibility for all begins with this site and our efforts to ensure all functionality and all content is accessible to all Americans,\" the White House's accessibility statement reads.On Jan. 25, Psaki announced there would be an ASL interpreter available at every news briefing, saying Biden is \u201ccommitted to building an America that is more inclusive, more just and more accessible for every American, including Americans with disabilities and their families.\u201dIt is a marked contrast from the previous occupant of the White House. Deaf Americans and the National Association of the Deaf sued President Donald Trump's administration to provide an ASL interpreter at all briefings related to the coronavirus, arguing that the lack of access to information about the pandemic violated the First Amendment rights of deaf and hard-of-hearing people. About 11.5 million Americans have some degree of hearing loss, according to the Census Bureau.A judge ordered that an interpreter be provided beginning last October.More:Biden signs executive action to reopen Obamacare enrollment amid COVID-19, end gag ruleThough the Biden team sought to make its events and content accessible throughout his campaign and transition to office, there is still work to do to improve, Novic said.\u00a0The White House provided ASL interpretation through the use of a remote interpreter on screen, but Novic noted that this is viewable only through White House media channels. In the most common places people get information, such as television news, interpretation is not available.\u201cI am very happy the Biden administration is thinking about accessibility and providing these accessible streams, but I hope other platforms and networks, where people would normally access this content, follow suit, so one doesn't have to be on the computer tracking it down,\u201d Novic said.Social media users pointed out a lack of captioning at some briefings on the White House\u2019s channels, an accessibility feature necessary for many who are deaf or hard-of-hearing and do not use ASL\u00a0or people with other disabilities that make written captions helpful.Deaf professor Jon Hemmer\u00a0revealed on Twitter that the ASL interpreter used Jan. 25, the day it was announced from the White House podium that interpretation would be available, has ties to a group that interprets for extreme right-wing videos.Time\u00a0reported the interpreter, Heather Mewshaw, managed a group that interpreted for videos including COVID-19 misinformation and election fraud conspiracy theories. Some deaf people said on social media that it was unsettling to trust information coming from Mewshaw, and she\u00a0should not have taken the job because of a clear bias.\u201cOf course, someone has a right to work, no matter their politics, and technically, she is bound by the interpreter code of conduct,\u201d Novic said. \u201cHowever, as a viewer, the idea of having to rely on that person to be a neutral conduit makes me nervous, in part because language of any kind is never neutral.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a request for comment regarding the use of Mewshaw as an interpreter.More:Biden got the vote of abortion rights advocates.

She told him she was deaf.\"I'm going to be reading your lips a lot tonight, but thankfully you have really beautiful lips,\" she said.Abigail, who graduated from South Salem High School in 2013, was born with congenital hearing loss and wears a cochlear implant.It's a topic her mom told the Statesman Journal last fall during filming that Abigail doesn't usually talk much about. But there she was during the premiere, on the steps of a palatial Pennsylvania resort, sharing it all with Matt and millions of viewers who watch ABC's romance reality show.Her vulnerability impressed Matt so much he later gave her the highly-coveted first impression rose, which made her an instant frontrunner for the historic 25th season.He's the first Black bachelor, and she's reportedly the show's first contestant who is deaf.For at least one more week, Salem has reason to tune in to the show. Abigail and 23 other women who received roses during\u00a0the two-hour premiere will resume competing for Matt's heart.Hometown appeal:Salem has someone to root for | \u00a0Abigail's mom isn't worriedHe's a\u00a028-year-old real estate broker, entrepreneur and community organization founder from North Carolina. He earned an economics degree and played football at Wake Forest University.Abigail is listed as a\u00a025-year-old client financial manager from Beaverton, but she grew up here, attending Salem Heights and Candalaria elementary schools, Leslie Middle School and South Salem High.She graduated from Linfield College and took time away from her job with a marketing and event company in the Portland area to participate in the\u00a0show.His 'one and only'?\u00a0The premiere started with an introduction\u00a0to Matt, who viewers learned was raised by a single mom in a Christian household. His mom, who is white, made an appearance and said, \"I want you to meet your one and only.\"Viewers also learned quickly that Matt's physique is sure to be a hot topic. He was shown shirtless twice in the intro, first jogging, then jumping rope, doing lunges and pull-ups. His six-pack abs may get more air time this season than some of the women.They were introduced next, and Abigail told viewers she was born deaf and wears a cochlear implant. She admitted it's awkward to bring up on a date.Next came\u00a0the\u00a0traditional limo entrances, with\u00a0Matt waiting to meet each woman on the red-lined steps of\u00a0the Nemacolin Woodlands Resort in Pennsylvania, where filming took place.COVID impact:16 Salem-area restaurants now closed until further noticeAs show teasers alluded, one woman arrived in nothing but black lingerie and asked Matt\u00a0to help her pick out an outfit from a rack of clothes. Another arrived\u00a0in a chauffeur-driven gold Bentley, only to be upstaged by a woman being carried in on a throne like Cleopatra, wearing a gold crown and declaring herself the queen.Abigail arrived in a blue dress and revealed her disability.Matt later thanked her for being open, honest and vulnerable when\u00a0they\u00a0had one-on-one time inside. During their conversation, Abigail talked about her older sister, Rachel, who also was born with congenital hearing loss and wears a cochlear implant.Matt asked how her sister felt about her being on \"The Bachelor.\"\"She was super supportive,\" Abigail told him. \"I'm super close with my family. They just want what's going to make me happy at the end of the day.\"He admitted to her that he was nervous when they met.\"Once I heard your name, I just kind of went blank,\" he said. \"I tried, but it's like you were gorgeous. It was hard to focus on anything else.\"Apparently, he didn't even see her hit the door as she got out of the limo.\"I was just staring at your eyes,\" he said. \"I'm glad you're here.\"And then, they kissed.He left for a moment and returned with the first impression rose hidden behind his back.\"One of the things I challenged the women with\u00a0was being vulnerable,\" Matt said, \"and knowing that you're a fighter, I thought that it was only appropriate that I ask you something. Will you accept this rose?\"She did, of course. And they kissed and hugged.\"I'm like on cloud nine right now,\" she said told viewers after\u00a0receiving the rose. \"I'm just super excited to hopefully keep it going and learn more about each other.\"Learn more about AbigailBetween now and the next episode, Bachelor fans can learn all about Abigail by reading the Statesman Journal's previous coverage\u00a0and by visiting the network website. Her bio comes up first on the cast list\u00a0\u2014 in alphabetical order by contestants'\u00a0first names.Here's what it reveals:\"Abigail is a beautiful soul from the Pacific Northwest who says that nothing makes her happier than enjoying a cold local microbrew on a beautiful Oregon day.

She says she is looking for a man who will lift her up and make her feel like it's just the two of them in the whole wide world.\"Good looks are definitely a plus, but Abigail says that getting to know someone on a deeper level is far more important in a successful relationship. Abigail says she doesn't believe in love at first sight, but we'll see if that holds up after she meets Matt!\"Abigail can't talk about the show because she signed a nondisclosure agreement, so Salem will have to stay tuned to find out what happens next.Another contestant from Oregon, 23-year-old graduate student Pieper James from Happy Valley, also received a rose and advanced to the Jan. 11 episode.Matt will again be\u00a0tasked with\u00a0interacting\u00a0with the women and presenting\u00a0roses to those he wishes to remain in contention for a\u00a0potential proposal and engagement ring in the finale.Capi Lynn is the Statesman Journal\u2019s news columnist.

The radio host left hate and ugliness in his wakeIn December, Limbaugh declared he thought the country was \"trending toward secession,\u201d then walked the comment back the next day. He wasn't advocating for another civil war, he was only repeating what he had heard, he told listeners.\u00a0After a mob of pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, provoking outraged sputtering from Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives alike, Limbaugh stood out in dismissing the controversy.\u00a0\"We're supposed to be horrified by the protesters,\" Limbaugh scoffed on his program Jan. 7.\u00a0\"There's a lot of people out there calling for the end of violence ... lot of conservatives, social media, who say that any violence or aggression at all is unacceptable regardless of the circumstances. ... I am glad Sam Adams,\u00a0Thomas Paine,\u00a0the actual tea-party guys,\u00a0the men at Lexington and Concord, didn't feel that way.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Love him or loathe him, few would deny that Limbaugh was one of the most influential commercial broadcasters,\u00a0if not the most influential, in American history, said Michael Harrison,\u00a0founder and publisher of Talkers trade magazine, which covers talk radio.Harrison\u00a0said Limbaugh's legacy \u2013\u00a0his\u00a0impact on\u00a0public policy, on the national culture and on GOP politicians from the presidency\u00a0on down \u2013\u00a0remains\u00a0unmatched.\u00a0\u201cLimbaugh\u2019s radio talent and dedication to the medium are unparalleled in the modern talk industry,\" he said. \"At a time when the very future of radio and its talent pool could very much be on the wane in terms of cultural relevance and prestige, he raised it to a level of importance on a par with the most influential media platforms and players of our time.\u201d\u00a0Journalist Ze'ev Chafets, whose 2010 biography of Limbaugh (\"Rush Limbaugh: An Army of One\") grew out of a New York Times magazine cover story in 2008, said Limbaugh was one of the top two or three most important figures in Republican politics in the 1990s.\"The reason is his show was heard in every congressional district in the country, and certainly every state, by a huge number of Republicans\u00a0who almost entirely made up his audience,\" Chafets said. \"He was able, at a granular level, to affect elections. The year Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House (1994), he gave Limbaugh an honorary membership in\u00a0(the Republican caucus in) Congress because of his influence.\"\"Coastal Americans\" who didn\u2019t listen to Limbaugh had no idea of his \"gravitational pull\" because they underestimated his communication talents and his smarts, at least initially, Chafets said.\"They didn\u2019t understand because they thought he was a carnival barker talking to rubes,\"\u00a0Chafets said. \"He talked about issues, not gossip. His show (consisted of) three-hour monologues without notes and included minute details about arcane matters that most talk show hosts could not do.\"He was original,\u00a0he was funny and he was adept at assembling key elements of broadcasting to produce entertaining and compelling radio, Harrison said.\u00a0\"He was a consummate pro, and even people who disagreed with him politically, most who are honest will tell you what a great broadcaster he (was),\" Harrison said. \"Because he used so many elements of great radio: pacing, his voice, satire, sound effects. The flow and feel of his show was very appealing in his use of sound and broadcast principles.\"Limbaugh's show was\u00a0the most listened-to talk radio broadcast in the USA, bringing a\u00a0cumulative weekly audience of about 15.5 million listeners at his peak, according to Talkers' tracking. \"No one beats Rush in the political news talk radio format \u2013 he\u2019s No. 1,\" Harrison said.\u00a0\u00a0His was a life and career of wild success pockmarked by controversies and health calamities, including years of chronic back pain and unsuccessful surgery,\u00a0leading to long-term prescription opioid addiction and 30 days in rehab in 2003.\u00a0In 2006, he was criminally investigated and arrested for alleged \"doctor shopping\" to obtain multiple prescriptions in Florida, a charge dropped after a plea agreement and his promise to continue addiction treatment (although Limbaugh maintained his innocence).In 2001, he announced he had gone deaf over three months for unknown reasons, although his doctors said it could have been from years of drug addiction. He had\u00a0cochlear implants to restore some of his hearing.\u00a0Then lung cancer struck.\u00a0Limbaugh gave his\u00a0legions of fans plenty of advance notice of the coming end.\u00a0On Oct. 20, he told listeners his cancer was terminal.\u00a0\u201cYou measure a happy life against whatever medication it takes. And at some point, you decide, you know, this medication may be working, but I hate the way I feel every day,\u201d Limbaugh said on the air. \u201cI\u2019m not there yet. But it is part and parcel of this.\"It\u2019s tough to realize that the days where I do not think I\u2019m under a death sentence are over.\u201dHis listeners were shocked when he revealed his diagnosis on his show in February 2020, not long after being told on Jan. 20 the grim news by\u00a0\"two medical institutions.\"\u00a0\"This day has been one of the most difficult days in recent memory for me. I've known this moment is coming in the program. ... I'm sure that you all know by now that I really don't like talking about myself and I don't like making things about me,\" Limbaugh said. \"I like this program to be about you and the things that matter to all of us.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, he said, he knew he had to\u00a0explain what was going on in his life because listeners would be curious if he wasn't at his usual post every day. Even though he had no symptoms at that time, he realized that would not last and he would have to be absent for treatment.\u00a0\"It\u2019s not that I want to fool anybody, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t want to burden anybody with it and I haven\u2019t wanted to,\" he said. \"But it is what it is. You know me, I\u2019m the mayor of Realville.\"A day later, he was visibly moved when President Trump, his longtime friend and Florida neighbor, awarded him the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, during a State of the Union address in the House of Representatives.\u00a0\u00a0Attending as one of Trump's \"special guests,\" the white-bearded and ruddy-faced\u00a0 Limbaugh sat in the House gallery next to first lady Melania Trump, who fastened\u00a0the medal on a blue ribbon around his neck.\"In recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work that you do for charity, I\u2019m proud to announce tonight that you will receive our nation\u2019s highest civilian honor,\" Trump said to applause in the chamber.In May, Limbaugh updated\u00a0his listeners on the state of his health with a candid assessment.\u00a0\"I vowed not to be a cancer patient on the radio. I vowed to shield as much of that from the daily program as I can,\" Limbaugh said before talking about his third wave of treatment. \"I have to tell you, it's kicking my ass.\"He said the previous week of treatments left him \"virtually worthless\" and \"virtually useless.\" He hadn't left the house or done much of anything, as doctors warned him would happen.\"It's the price that you pay if you make the decision to go ahead and do treatment to try to prolong your life,\" he said, adding that he was doing \"extremely well, all things considered.\"Then came his grim assessment in October. He tried to be upbeat, but the progression of the cancer\u00a0and the treatment\u00a0had not been easy.\u00a0\"Some days are harder than others,\" he said. \"I do get fatigued now. I do get very, very tired now. I\u2019m not gonna mislead you about that. But I am extremely grateful to be able to come here to the studio and to maintain as much normalcy as possible \u2013 and it\u2019s still true.\"The day before Christmas 2020, on his final show of the year, he updated listeners on his health again, saying he hadn't expected to make it past October, let alone into December. \"And yet\u00a0here I am and today, got some problems, but I'm feeling pretty good today. \u2026 God knows how important this program is for me today,\" he said, thanking listeners.Limbaugh is survived by his fourth wife,\u00a0Kathryn Rogers, whom he married in 2010. Three previous marriages ended in divorce. He did not have children.\u00a0Born on Jan. 12, 1951, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Rush Hudson Limbaugh III came from a line of conservative Republicans that included\u00a0lawyers, judges and ambassadors. His family looked askance at his early yen \u2013 while still in grammar school \u2013 to become a radio star.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI said, \u2018Pop, I love this. I know I'm great at it. I'm gonna get even better,\u2019\u201d Limbaugh told interviewers later.When he was 9, he got a toy radio as a gift and began \"broadcasting\" on AM frequencies in his home, entertaining his family playing DJ with his records. In high school, he worked as a DJ at a\u00a0station co-owned by his father.\u00a0He lasted only one year at Southeast Missouri State University before leaving to pursue a career in radio.It did not go well at first.\u00a0He was fired from stations in Missouri and Pennsylvania for being too controversial as a news commentator. In the mid-1980s, he landed at KFBK in Sacramento, California, as an on-air host. Within a year, he was\u00a0Sacramento's top radio host.The repeal of the Federal Communications Commission's\u00a0Fairness Doctrine in 1987\u00a0\u00a0gave Limbaugh his head to broadcast his controversial opinions without having to present opposing views. In July 1988, he launched his own show on a talk station in New York City, and he was off to the races: His star was rising, and people noticed.\u00a0\"A large new noise echoes across the invisible cacophony that is talk radio,\" Louis Grossberger reported in The New York Times in December 1990.\u00a0 \"His subject is politics. His stance: conservative. His persona: comic blowhard. His style: a schizoid spritz, bouncing between earnest lecturer and political vaudevillian.\"\u00a0Limbaugh demonstrated his fervent support for the Persian Gulf War by ridiculing anyone who sought peace. His show was moved to stations with larger audiences until Limbaugh was broadcasting on more than 650 stations nationwide. The election of President Bill Clinton in 1992 only fueled the possibilities of lacerating satire aimed at Democrats.\u00a0Ever since, Limbaugh maintained his position as the king of talk radio while fending off multiple flaps over controversial things he said on the air, about racial and ethnic minorities,\u00a0feminism and the notion of sexual consent, environmentalism and climate change, his admiration for Trump and his disdain for\u00a0President Barack Obama; Limbaugh was an on-air superspreader of the \"birtherism\" lie that Obama was not born in the USA, and called activist women \"feminazis.\"Some of\u00a0the harsh things he said, including blatant bigotry, helped fuel his popularity. He\u00a0played the song \u201cBarack the Magic Negro\u201d (set to the tune of \u201cPuff, the Magic Dragon\u201d) on his show to depict\u00a0Obama as someone who \u201cmakes guilty whites feel good\u201d and is \u201cblack, but not authentically.\u201dWhen actor Michael J. Fox, suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease, appeared in a Democratic campaign commercial, Limbaugh mocked his tremors. As the AIDS epidemic raged in the 1980s, he made dying a punchline. He called 12-year-old Chelsea Clinton a dog.\u00a0Most of the\u00a0controversies rolled off him, except for Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown University law student who testified in Congress in 2012 in support of mandating insurance coverage for contraceptives.\u00a0Limbaugh mocked her, suggesting this view made her a \"slut\" and a \"prostitute.\"\u00a0\"That was the most damaging thing he ever did,\" Harrison said. The outcry that followed\u00a0kicked off boycotts by major sponsors of talk radio, even though Limbaugh issued a\u00a0rare apology for \"insulting word choices.\"\"It had a\u00a0terrible economic impact on the talk radio business in general,\" Harrison said. \"It's the one major blemish on his history that hurt his fellow broadcasters. Now he's been forgiven because of what he's done for the industry that outweighs that.\"In between doing his show and advising Republican presidents and candidates, Limbaugh wrote best-selling books (\"The Way Things Ought to Be\" in 1992, followed in 1993 by \"See, I Told You So\"), including a series of children's books.\u00a0He supported several charities, including a telethon for leukemia and lymphoma,\u00a0 the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation\u00a0and the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, which honors firefighters\u00a0who died saving others in the 9/11 terrorist attack on the twin towers in New York.Chafets, who grew up in Michigan, remembers when he first heard Limbaugh on the radio as he was driving one day near Detroit.\u00a0\"Before Rush Limbaugh, you could not hear conservative thought on the radio in the USA \u2013\u00a0Rush is the first guy to provide that, the rock-and-roll DJ with the news. And that shocked people,\" Chafets said. \"I could not believe it myself. I actually pulled over to listen to what he was saying. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\"Contributing: Hannah Yasharoff"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/03/02/education-commissioner-visits-battle-creek-elementary-praises-mcps/6838569002/", "headline": "Education Commissioner praises Maury County Public Schools ...", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 10:00 p.m. ET March 1, 2021 Updated: 1:22 p.m. ET March 2, 2021", "text": "Tennessee Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn toured Spring Hill\u2019s Battle Creek Elementary School, praising the work of Maury County Public Schools educators.Schwinn met with MCPS Superintendent\u00a0Michael Hickman and Rep.

They\u2019ll charge us more.\u201dMore:Non-motor transportation in Westland getting a closer look in 'Walk and Roll' planMore:Westland man sentenced to 5-15 years in killing of Olivia Rossi, 23General fund money, used for the city\u2019s day-to-day operating costs, handles most of the city\u2019s insurance coverage for employee liability, vehicles and\u00a0buildings, sewage overflows, data breaches and other uncomfortable matters.\u00a0Water funds also help manage the costs.The annual premium for this current budget cycle is approximately $1 million, compared to about $882,000 in 2015-2016, indicating an average 2.9% increase for each of the last five years.For the \u201ctrue cost\u201d of insurance, which includes coverage for large claims and money on reserve for possible settlements, the city will pay about $1.3 million this budget cycle, compared to $1.1 million in 2015-16. That means an average increase of 2.4% for the last five years.Both premiums and overall insurance costs jumped their highest,\u00a0of\u00a0at least 5%, between the 2016-17 and 2017-18 budget cycles.Without comment, the city council voted to approve the Marshall settlement in May 2018.ImplicationsWestland officials typically do not talk about specific pending legislation. Smith, though, agreed to talk about what the 2021 lawsuits might mean for the city\u2019s finances.He said, at any given time, Westland might be dealing with several lawsuits.\u201cIn a given month, there could be 10 cases,\u201d Smith\u00a0said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t high profile cases. These are somebody, you know, maybe tripped on a sidewalk that was raised or somebody got, say, a flat tire due to a pothole.\u201cA lot of the cases, they get denied because of governmental immunity, but they still will file something with the insurance company.\u201dSmith would not provide the specific number of lawsuits that the city is now dealing with, but said there is no\u00a0noticeable uptick in cases filed since Marshall\u2019s December 2017 death. And no legal confrontation with the same high-profile consequences has transpired since the tragic\u00a0preventable death.The year 2021 began in the wake of a nationwide uprisings connected to\u00a0the Black Lives Matter movement, and Livonia and Farmington Hills also have been sued\u00a0with\u00a0allegations against their police departments in the new year.\u201cGiven just the nature of things right now, I think everybody wants to sue somebody,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou see the commercials every morning, right? Call me for free. Call this lawyer. Call that lawyer. It\u2019s constant.\u201cIf people think they are wronged or if they have an opportunity to get some of those big dollars like the commercials say, they may look into filing a claim.\u201dThere are plenty of suits, he said, that get settled for no money at all.The city\u2019s law firm, Fausone Bohn in Northville, handles Westland\u2019s District Court cases, which eats up most of the annual $850,000 it receives as the city\u2019s \u201claw department.\u201d\u00a0The firm also spends an average of about $72,000 a year on litigation costs.The firm\u2019s attorneys also work with the Michigan Municipal Risk Management Authority on Westland cases.Rights to sueLawsuits are part of the contemporary police officer\u2019s landscape sometimes because of critics who want to question, punish and reform police because of perceived wrongdoing.What suburban\u00a0Detroit agencies are often dealing with may be small compared to the lawsuits filed against metropolitan police departments and their host cities.However, a nationwide University of California \u2013 Los Angeles study that is now several years old reviewed budgeting practices for police litigation in 100 jurisdictions.Authored by law professor Joanna Schwartz, the study found that general funds don\u2019t always finance settlements and judgements.About half of the law enforcement agencies reviewed contributed financially but individual police officers \u201cvirtually never\u201d pay settlements and judgments against them.\u00a0The study also concluded smaller agencies that pay nothing from their budgets toward their lawsuits may still face financial threats if insurers raise premiums or terminate coverage because of large payouts.Contact reporter Susan Vela at svela@hometownlife.com or 248-303-8432.

We do, however,\u00a0have a doleful history of bigotry, crowned by our eager embrace of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s.\u00a0The Klan infected thousands of Hoosier families, including my own.Jim Crow cast a long shadow over Indiana high school sports.\u00a0A few days after the 1927 opening of Indianapolis Crispus Attucks High School -- a school built with taxpayer funds to quarantine black students and teachers -- three prominent black leaders applied in person for Attucks\u00a0to become members of the Indiana High School Athletic Association.They met with Arthur L. Trester, the square-jawed, dictatorial figure who controlled every aspect of high school sports in Indiana.\u00a0Photos:Crispus Attucks: The championship teamsDoyel:Truth behind Crispus Attucks, Arthur Trester & IHSAA's top individual awardTrester listened as his guests made their case:\u00a0Membership in the IHSAA would allow Attucks to compete against other Hoosier teams\u00a0and take part in the nationally famous Indiana boys\u2019 basketball tournament.Everyone would be able to see that Attucks athletes, regardless of the color of their skin, belonged to Indiana\u2019s family of schools.\u00a0It was only fair and American to give Attucks a chance.\u00a0Trester answered on the spot with a blunt \"no.\"\u00a0Attucks was a private school, he said \u2014open to blacks only.\u00a0The ISHAA governed only public schools, so Trester\u2019s hands were tied. The same would be true for segregated high schools planned for Gary and Evansville, for the state\u2019s Catholic schools, and for the Indiana School for the Deaf.\u00a0For the next 15 years, Arthur Trester kept Attucks out of the state tournament.\u00a0He relented only when state legislator Robert Brokenburr introduced a bill to seize control of high school sports from Trester\u2019s IHSAA.The bill\u2019s supporters pointed out that young black men who would soon be ordered to risk their lives for their country should be able to play in high school sporting events.\u00a0On December 20, 1941, Trester, his hand forced, issued a matter-of-fact order opening the IHSAA to all \u201cpublic, private, parochial, colored and institutional schools of the state.\u201dArthur Trester died in 1944.\u00a0To honor his memory, the IHSAA established the Arthur L. Trester Award for Mental Attitude,\u00a0awarded to the high school senior playing in the state finals who excels in mental attitude, scholarship, leadership\u00a0and basketball ability.The Trester Award\u00a0became instantly coveted.\u00a0No one seemed bothered by the irony that we were venerating a man who abused his monumental power to extend the Klan\u2019s program and philosophy. More than three-quarters of a century\u00a0after his death, the award is still given to high school seniors in enrollment classes A, AA\u00a0and AAA.Now, at a moment in our national life when we examine racism more closely than ever, the Trester Award has become our statue of a Confederate general.\u00a0It should be renamed.Here\u2019s an idea:\u00a0How about the Raymond P. Crowe Award for sportsmanship?\u00a0Ray Crowe, who coached the great Attucks teams of the 1950s, consistently modeled sportsmanship under the most trying of circumstances.\u00a0Attucks rarely saw a black referee and played all its games on the road.Coach Crowe did not let his players complain about questionable calls.\u00a0He instructed them not to answer the racial taunts they heard everywhere they went.\u00a0Winning will be our statement, he told them.\u00a0 And he was right.\u00a0It\u2019s long past time to rename the Trester Award to honor a genuine sportsman.\u00a0Phillip Hoose is the author of \"Attucks!\u00a0Oscar Robertson and the Basketball Team That Awakened a City\" and the 2009 National Book Award-winning\u00a0\"Claudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice.\""}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/brain-and-spine-surgeons-of-new-york/2021/01/04/bssny-specializes-hearing-restoration-tumor-removal-and-more/4085537001/", "headline": "BSSNY specializes in hearing restoration, tumor removal and more", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published 5:00 a.m. ET Jan. 4, 2021", "text": "At Brain and Spine Surgeons of New York (BSSNY), the practice is always looking for better ways to serve their wide range of patients needing neurosurgical care. To do so, they recently designated an otology and neurotology unit to help patients tackle relevant ear, nose and throat (ENT) issues.Standard procedures include hearing restoration surgery, managing infections and tumors of the ear and implanting hearing devices, such as cochlear implants.The new unit fits neatly into BSSNY\u2019s overall approach to spine and neurosurgery services. It combines a team of some of the world\u2019s leading specialists to deliver top-tier, personalized services all under one roof.Minimally invasive removal of brain tumorsOne area in which BSSNY\u2019s ENT specialists have excelled is cranial base surgery. This type of surgery is one of the most complex in the medical field and requires highly trained surgeons to remove tumors located along or beneath the skull base or the brain.The specialists at BSSNY are among the only surgeons in the country who routinely operate anywhere within the cranial or skull base. And, when they do, they\u2019re able to use minimally invasive methods in some cases, approaching a tumor through the nose, sinuses or ears.BSSNY neurotologist Dr. Darius Kohan noted that compared with the more invasive method of drilling through the skull, approaching through the nose, ears or sinuses is associated with shorter recovery times and less serious side effects.\u201cThese techniques are less traumatic than standard neurosurgery techniques to patients and have better outcomes with fewer complications,\u201d said Kohan.BSSNY offers patients one of the widest ranges of minimally invasive options possible In modern medicine.Restoring hearing using cochlear implantsAnother ENT procedure where BSSNY stands out is the insertion of cochlear implants. These implantable auditory devices can be life-changing for people who are deaf or hearing impaired.\u201cWith cochlear implants, we can restore hearing to patients who would otherwise be deaf,\u201d said Kohan.Cochlear implants are tiny electronic devices with interior and exterior components that process sound to help with hearing. The surgery can be highly effective for people who can no longer be helped by hearing aids.Kohan is one of the foremost experts in the use of implantable devices to restore hearing. For him, being part of the research and revolutionary methods surrounding these groundbreaking devices is one of his greatest professional accomplishments.Leading the charge in innovationIn addition to treating patients, Kohan prides himself on teaching the next generation of ear surgeons. He holds faculty positions at NYU Langone\u2019s Tisch Hospital, Lenox Hill Hospital and other prestigious institutions.Additionally, he is director of neurotology of otolaryngology for both Lenox Hill Hospital and its Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital (MEETH) division.Since Kohan and his BSSNY colleagues have been at the forefront of advances in hearing health, they consider it their responsibility to share their knowledge with other medical professionals and up-and-coming doctors in the field.Last year, the Northwell Health Office of Continuing Medical Education chose Kohan to head up the Northwell Health\u2019s Implantable Auditory Devices 2019, Continuing Medical Education (CME) Conference, addressing the gap in available innovation and real-world application. They selected him for his extensive research and experience in this growing field, where he has remained ahead of the curve for helping patients hear again in ways not possible before. \u00a0The goal of the conference was to educate and close the gap in the increase in devices beyond hearing aids that are FDA-approved for auditory rehabilitation. It is a rapidly advancing area, where Kohan has proven himself a leader.Kohan has been recognized as a New York Times \u201cSuperDoctor,\u201d a Castle Connolly Top Doctor and a New York Magazine Top Doctor.\u00a0From writing books and articles to serving as keynote speakers for highly anticipated conferences, BSSNY doctors like Kohan are continually working to advance the standard of treatment.Kohan\u2019s practice is primarily based in Manhattan, but he will soon be seeing and managing patients part time in White Plains.For more information about Brain & Spine Surgeons of New York and their ENT specialists, visit bssny.com."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/02/02/sundance-awards-coda-questlove-summer-of-soul-take-top-honors/4363283001/", "headline": "Sundance awards: 'CODA,' Questlove's 'Summer of Soul' take top ...", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 9:32 p.m. ET Feb. 2, 2021 Updated: 12:25 a.m. ET Feb. 3, 2021", "text": "A moving coming-of-age tale\u00a0about the hearing child of deaf parents and Questlove's documentary about the 1969\u00a0Harlem Cultural Festival\u00a0have won\u00a0the top jury and audience\u00a0awards at\u00a0Sundance Film Festival, which transformed itself from a snowy in-person event into a virtual affair this year amid the pandemic.\"CODA\" won the U.S. Grand Jury Prize for drama on Tuesday night, while\u00a0\"Summer of Soul (...

Her parents had a furniture business in Riverwest. The award-winning filmmaker of the hit documentary \"Science Fair\" has her own production company.\u00a0But the student entrepreneurs who are the focus of Costantini's new documentary, \"Own the Room\"? They're in a different league.\u00a0\"I am technically a small-business owner, but I am nowhere as accomplished as the kids in the film,\" the Milwaukee native said from Los Angeles.\u00a0Debuting March 12 on Disney+, \"Own the Room,\" which she co-directed with her \"Science Fair\" partner Darren Foster,\u00a0follows five young entrepreneurs from around the world who are taking part in the Global Student Entrepreneur Awards, an international competition in Macau with a top prize of $100,000.\u00a0But it's really about the journeys, dreams, hopes and resilience of the five young protagonists:\u00a0Santosh Pandey of Nepal, who bills himself as\u00a0a \"happiness distributor,\" delivering elaborate surprise messages;\u00a0Jason Hadzikostas of Greece, the co-founder of a program that uses artificial intelligence to translate infants' cries for new parents;Henry Onyango of\u00a0Kenya, who's developed\u00a0an Airbnb-like service for students;Alondra Toledo of\u00a0Puerto Rico, who has launched a platform that helps people who are hard of hearing communicate with doctors who don't speak sign language;And Daniela Blanco of Venezuela by way of New York, an engineer working on a way to invent a more sustainable nylon without using fossil fuels.\u00a0While they're all thinking in business terms, they're also thinking about the world in an ambitious, heartfelt way. Santosh got the idea for his business recognizing that, with so many people leaving Nepal to work in other countries to support families at home, those connections were being starved for attention. Daniela's goal is nothing short of reinventing the chemical industry in a sustainable way.\u00a0\"They think so big,\" Costantini said. \"\u00a0\u2026 There's just so much to admire in that spirit.\"\u00a0They are competing with each other, but it's not competitive in the reality-TV-show sense. They're rooting for each other and learning from each other.\u00a0\"I love when Henry says, 'When Daniela wins, we all win,' \" Costantini said.\u00a0\u00a0Companion to 'Science Fair'\u00a0\u00a0With its focus on youthful passion and idealism, Costantini said\u00a0\"Own the Room\" is a \"natural continuation of the idea of\u00a0'Science Fair,' \" her 2018 documentary following a group of student scientists in another international competition.\"Science Fair\" collected more than a dozen top prizes on the festival circuit, including the audience awards at the Sundance, SXSW and Milwaukee film festivals. It's currently streaming on Disney+, and available on digital platforms like Amazon and Google Play.Costantini, who competed in science fairs herself when she was growing up in Milwaukee, was an investigative journalist before she was a filmmaker, focusing on \"things that were going wrong.\" But \"at a certain point, I think I got tired of telling those stories,\" she said, and more interested in \"people who were fixing those problems and addressing these big questions.\"\u00a0That's also what drew Costantini to her second feature-length documentary, \"Mucho Mucho Amor: The Legend of Walter Mercado,\" an affectionate profile of Puerto Rico's hugely popular TV astrologer. She got to thinking about Mercado, a joyful, life-affirming personality she grew up watching with her grandmother, and wondered what had happened to him and started looking for him.\u00a0Debuting last summer on Netflix, \"Mucho Mucho Amor\" was one of 2020's best-reviewed movies, still boasting a perfect 100% \"fresh\" rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.\u00a0\"All these movies are about people trying to spread happiness \u2026 ,\" Costantini said. \"I do think there's a certain hopefulness those movies have in common.\"\u00a0During COVID, a different perspective\u00a0\"Mucho Mucho Amor\" and \"Own the Room\" were both shot and edited in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0To make \"Own the Room,\" the filmmakers interviewed 50 people who were in the process of the competition, and found people who had impressive stories.\u00a0\"They all have this kind of grit and determination,\" Costantini said, \"and really were, I think, brave for striking out on their own.\"\u00a0Some of the experiences that made it into \"Own the Room\" look a little different today, through the lens of the pandemic. For example, when Daniela goes into her big presentation, she is shown powering through a very bad cold, \"which, in 2019, was an admirable thing to do,\" Costantini said. \"\u00a0\u2026 That's something we all did before the pandemic. And now, that means something a little different.\"\u00a0\u00a0Contact Chris Foran at chris.foran@jrn.com.

And with two \u201ckaiju\u201d for the price of one, it\u2019s double-sized destruction.Kong swings from skyscrapers and swats choppers out of the air like mosquitoes. Godzilla crushes buildings and flattens cities with the swing of his tail or a belch of fiery radioactive breath. When they first share a scene, it\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s also fun to watch the background actors, whose principal function is to scream and flee.The spectacle continues to thrive even when forced to watch the film on an iPad, which was the case with me. I fiercely miss a good popcorn flick and this, the fourth in the Legendary MonsterVerse, is one of those movies that you need to see on the biggest screen possible. In that venue, your senses will be too overwhelmed to care about a convoluted story pocked with plot holes and characters spouting too much exposition and scientific mumbo jumbo. But, no one comes to a mega meeting of two Mr. Bigs for the story.What passes for depth in a screenplay written by Eric Pearson and Max Borenstein is an adorable mute girl, Jia (Kaylee Hottle), who communicates with Kong via sign language. She is a member of the Iwi tribe, native to Skull Island. She even has a homemade Kong doll. She taps fingers with Kong, like Eliot and E.T., much to the surprise of her guardian (Rebecca Hall). \u00a0We already knew the big lug was a ladies\u2019 man (think: Fay Wray, Jessica Lange and Naomi Watts.), now he\u2019s a real softie. Their relationship manipulatively tugs on your heart strings and sets up viewers to go all-in on Team Kong.\u00a0There\u2019s also an underdeveloped subplot involving Bernie (Brian Tyree Henry, terrific), host of a conspiracy theory podcast; Madison (Millie Bobby Brown, reprising her role), a teen-titan enthusiast; and Madison\u2019s nerdy best friend, Josh (Julian Dennison from Taika Waititi\u2019s \u201cHunt for the Wilderpeople\u201d).\u00a0Wingard (\"You're Next,\" \"The Guest,\" \"Blair Witch\") should have just focused on that Scooby-Doo-like trio seeking clues to what suddenly enraged an otherwise dormant Godzilla. All signs point to some \u201csuspicious tech\u201d developed at Apex Cybernetics, run by a nefarious CEO (Bichir), his daughter (Eiza Gonzalez) and henchman (Shun Oguri.)\u00a0When first spotted, Kong is living in containment in a biodome on Skull Island. The habitat isn\u2019t going to hold him much longer, remarks researcher and \u201cKong Whisperer,\u201d Dr. Ilene Andrews (Hall).

Staged in Harlem's Mount Morris Park in summer 1969, weeks before Woodstock festival in upstate New York, the event attracted\u00a0trailblazing Black artists including Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight, The Fifth Dimension, and Sly and the Family Stone.\u00a0Sundance\u00a02021:'CODA' star Marlee Matlin talks inclusion, calls on Hollywood to 'hire more deaf actors'The festival was captured in its entirety by filmmaker\u00a0Hal Tulchin, who tried to sell the footage to studios but was turned down. The reels sat in Tulchin's\u00a0basement for a half century until his death in 2017, when producers\u00a0David Dinerstein and Robert Fyvolent obtained the never-before-seen footage. They brought it to The Roots drummer\u00a0Ahmir \"Questlove\" Thompson, who makes his directorial debut with \"Summer of Soul.\"\u00a0\"I instantly kind of scoffed,\" Thompson said in a post-screening Q&A. \"I was like, 'Wait a minute. I know everything that happened in music history. There's no way you're going to tell me this gathering happened and no one knew about it.' But sure enough, that was the case. Once they showed me raw footage, I just sat there with my jaw dropped, like, 'How has this been forgotten?'\"Thompson expertly places the festival in context of what was happening in the United States in 1969, with racial injustice and antiwar protests, and general ambivalence to the landing on the moon. (\"Never mind the moon \u2014 let's get that cash to feed poor Black people in Harlem,\" one concertgoer says in a newsreel.)\u00a0He also asks why so much of Black culture has been erased from the history books or considered insignificant by traditionally white gatekeepers.\u00a0\"Why was this not important? Why was this deemed as just\u00a0'meh?'\" Thompson said. \"For me, that was the biggest question of all.\"\u00a0The two-hour \"Summer of Soul\" is edited together from roughly 45 hours of vibrant concert footage, which transports us back to pre-COVID times, when dancing with a sweaty crowd was a hobby and not a health hazard. The performances are jubilant and frequently profound, with highlights including a dynamic drum solo from a spry Wonder and a stirring set by Simone, who leads the audience in a hopeful yet melancholy rendition of \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black.\"\u00a0In new interviews, The Fifth Dimension members Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. recall how it felt to be welcomed and embraced by a majority Black audience for the first time, performing their No. 1 hit \"Aquarius / Let the Sunshine In\" from musical \"Hair.\" And Mavis Staples fondly recounts singing \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\" with gospel icon Mahalia Jackson, in a gut-wrenching tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. that will take your breath away.\u00a0\u00a0\"It was the ultimate Black barbecue,\" one festival-goer says of the event overall. \"But as soon as you heard the music, you knew it was something bigger.\"\u00a0\"Summer of Soul\"\u00a0will have a second virtual Sundance screening Saturday at 10 a.m. ET.

Key films such as \u201cOne Night in Miami,\u201d \u201cMinari\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d put an emphasis on stories of people of color with diverse storytellers at the helm.\u00a0We could begin to see how significant they'll be when nominations are announced for the Golden Globes on Wednesday and Screen Actors Guild Awards on Thursday.Sure, Meryl Streep might break her own record of 21 Oscar nominations. But there are\u00a0bigger deals at play. According to awards site GoldDerby.com, six Black actors are in the top five of their respective categories: Viola Davis (\u201cMa Rainey\u201d) and Zendaya (\u201cMalcolm & Marie\u201d) in best actress, Chadwick Boseman (\u201cMa Rainey\u201d) and Delroy Lindo (\u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d) in best actor, and Boseman (\u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d), Leslie Odom Jr. (\u201cOne Night in Miami\u201d) and Daniel Kaluuya (\u201cJudas and the Black Messiah\u201d) in supporting actor. That would be a record seven nominations for Black performers, breaking the precedent of six in 2017.\u00a0And although Asian heritage in Oscar history has been debated over the years, 2021 could see Asian actors breaking significant ground in the wake of a \"Parasite\" best picture win last year.Oscars 2021:Who's up, who's down, and where you can watch this year's contendersAcademy Awards:10 movies you need to see before the most unpredictable Oscar season everHere are eight actors and filmmakers who could make history when Oscar nominations are announced March 15:Riz AhmedThe first Asian and first Muslim to win a lead acting Emmy (for \u201cThe Night Of\u201d), Ahmed impressed critics and pundits alike as a rocker drummer forced to deal with being deaf in \u201cSound of Metal.\u201d The British star would be only the third Asian performer to be nominated for best actor \u2013 the others being Yul Brynner\u00a0(\u201cThe King and I\u201d) and Ben Kingsley (\u201cGandhi\u201d and \u201cHouse of Sand and Fog\u201d) \u2013 plus Ahmed would be the first nominee of Pakistani heritage in the category.Chadwick BosemanBoseman, who died last August at age 43, has two high-profile roles this awards season: as a self-absorbed musician\u00a0in \u201cMa Rainey\u201d and the charismatic U.S. Army squad leader of \u201cDa 5 Bloods.\u201d If nominated for both, Boseman would be the first posthumous double nominee in Oscar history. And were he to win, it\u2019d be the third posthumous win by an actor, after Peter Finch for \u201cNetwork\u201d and Heath Ledger for \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201dViola DavisA fourth nomination for Davis for \u201cMa Rainey,\u201d in which she plays the fiery title blues singer, would make her the most nominated Black actress in Academy history. Davis previously won supporting actress for \u201cFences,\u201d and a victory for \u201cMa Rainey\u201d would make Davis the first Black actress with multiple wins and the eighth actress in history to snag both lead and supporting Oscars.Regina KingThe actress-turned-filmmaker is earning many kudos for \u201cOne Night in Miami,\u201d her directorial debut focusing on\u00a0Black icons Cassius Clay (Eli Goree), Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge), Sam Cooke (Odom) and Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir). Garnering a best director nomination would make King the first woman of color, the first Black woman and only the seventh Black person in the category.\u00a0Spike LeeAfter winning his first Oscar two years ago for the \"BlacKkKlansman\" screenplay, Lee is back in the awards conversation for \"Da 5 Bloods,\" about a crew of African American Vietnam vets who return to the battlefield years later. A best director nomination would make Lee the first Black filmmaker to compete in the category twice (he was also nominated for \"BlacKkKlansman\").Steven YeunYeun, best known to audiences for the zombie TV show \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d has a career-defining turn in \u201cMinari\u201d as a Korean American farmer who moves his family from California to Arkansas in search of the American dream. Yeun would be the second Asian American nominated for best actor (after Brynner, who was an American citizen at the time of his win)\u00a0\u2013 and like Ahmed, he\u2019d be among only a handful of Asian performers in the category and the first performer of Korean descent.Yuh-jung YounPlaying a scene-stealing grandmother in \u201cMinari,\u201d the 73-year-old South Korean actress is finally finding recognition in America after decades of\u00a0film and TV work overseas. She\u2019d be the fourth Asian\u00a0nominated for supporting actress and would be only the second to win, after Japanese-born Miyoshi Umeki (\u201cSayonara\u201d) became the first Asian actor to receive an Oscar in 1957. And like her co-star Yeun, Youn would be the first Korean actor with a nomination.Chloe ZhaoZhao revealed the nomadic world of older Americans who hit the road to make a living in \u201cNomadland,\u201d a best picture contender starring Frances McDormand. With King,\u00a0the Chinese filmmaker would share the designation of being the first woman of color in a category where only five female directors have been nominated (and just one, Kathryn Bigelow, has won)."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/all-usa/2021/03/08/indiana-girls-basketball-2021-indystar-super-team-jayla-smith-ally-becki-ari-wiggins-ashlynn-shade/6887506002/", "headline": "Indiana girls basketball: 2021 IndyStar Central Indiana Super Team", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 11:53 a.m. ET March 8, 2021 Updated: 3:37 p.m. ET March 9, 2021", "text": "The 2020-21 Indiana high school girls basketball season is complete, and plenty of players made a big impact.

This happened amid the racial protests around the country last summer following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck.Producers of the franchise in September said they would remove racist comments on its social media.The\u00a0Bachelor Diversity Campaign honored\u00a0James' casting ahead of the premiere Monday on Instagram.\"Hopefully, me being in this position normalizes this for other people of color,\" James says. \"And in the future, when there is a Black Bachelor,\u00a0it's not like, 'Oh, welcome, Keith, the next Black Bachelor.'\u00a0It's, 'Welcome, Keith, who happens to be Black' or\u00a0'Welcome, Keith, who happens to be Asian.'\"Harrison respects those who've lamented the show's lack of diversity in the past but cautions against badgering those making good-faith efforts to change.\"When you do see (change),\u00a0give people the grace, the understanding, the compassion in the room to change,\" he says. \"No movement's\u00a0going to work if you also don't give them the opportunity to make those changes. And that is something that gets lost in this cancel\u00a0culture, in this culture to want to be the most woke and demand more.\"James adds:\u00a0\"This was definitely a step in the right direction in terms of\u00a0what change looks like from an entertainment perspective. It was an honor to be a part of that, because I've seen how and what Rachel (Lindsay, the first Black \"Bachelorette\")\u00a0went through, when\u00a0she was the first. And I couldn't have imagined someone like that trailblazing something like this for myself. And I'm hoping to be that for the next person.\"More from Rachel Lindsay:'Bachelor,' 'Bachelorette' star Rachel Lindsay says hit ABC shows need to work harder to be more diverseAs for Harrison, he's not a big fan of reflecting on whether\u00a0the franchise moved fast enough:\u00a0\"There is this amazing culture of change going on. But there's also this culture of, how can I ruin that? \u00a0How can I say, well, you're not woke enough? What is woke enough\u00a0for you?\"During Adams' stint on \"Bachelorette\" the show tackled addiction, mental health and the Black Lives Matter movement. Viewers will see these conversations continue during James' season.James says kids are going to have to deal with conversations about race\u00a0in the future,\u00a0so it's something that should be discussed and talked about. He believes the show has taken steps in the right direction, but hopes \"that going forward, they continue to be as inclusive as they can. And we saw what that looks like this year.\"Harrison knows the show isn't all the way there when it comes to diversity and inclusion, despite the landmark casting (not to mention casting its first deaf contestant, Abigail). \"Are we all the way there? No. Are we going to continue? Absolutely. Will we continue to be criticized? Of course we will. But that's part of it. And I relish that. If this raises the level of debate, hey, I don't mind being that lightning rod. That's fine.

You'll see locations statewide that currently offer the vaccine, along with information about how to register at each site.Pharmacies statewide are offering COVID-19 vaccines to those 16 or 18 and older (depending on vaccine type; Pfizer is the only currently approved vaccine for 16- and 17-year-olds). To schedule at a pharmacy, visit their website or call a local pharmacy. Appointments are still limited based on supply allocated from the federal government to pharmacy chains.Appointments may also be booked at state-run PODs like Gila River Arena in Glendale, Desert Financial Arena in Tempe, Dexcom in Mesa, WestWorld in Scottsdale, Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff,\u00a0the University of Arizona in Tucson and Yuma Civic Center and at other locations across the state through the state's registration website. The state opens appointments for the next week on the podvaccine website at 11 a.m. each\u00a0Friday. State sites moved in April to indoor locations due to rising temperatures.The Scottsdale exhibition center WestWorld opened as an indoor site on April 22 and State Farm operations moved indoors to Gila River Arena in Glendale on April 23.Those who need technical support with the state's registration website can call\u00a0602-542-1000.People without internet access or who need help registering for an appointment can\u00a0call the state's COVID-19 hotline at 844-542-8201. The state says it's ramped up the call center in preparation to meet the demand of people calling to schedule appointments. The call center gets\u00a0daily cancellations from state-run sites, so calling at 8 a.m. when the call center opens may allow you to get one of those appointments.The state is working with several Arizona groups to hold vaccine events targeted at people with disabilities, as well as their caregivers and families. The first appointment-only event was scheduled for April 10 and April 11 at the Ability360 Center in Phoenix. Assistance scheduling an appointment is available at 602-256-2245.The Special Olympics is providing volunteers to assist those receiving vaccinations and the Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing is providing sign language interpreters. Disability groups are providing details of the events directly to their communities, state officials said.Organizations also are working to help seniors register for vaccine slots.Information on additional sites in Maricopa County is available at the county's vaccine webpage, with details about how to sign up for appointments at locations like pharmacies and clinics scattered across the Valley. The county is organizing pop-up vaccine events to vaccinate targeted communities such as hard-to-reach neighborhoods and frontline essential workers.For more information about eligibility and local vaccination locations, contact your county\u00a0or visit its website.Apache CountyCochise CountyCoconino CountyGila CountyGraham CountyGreenlee CountyLa Paz CountyMaricopa CountyMohave County\u00a0Navajo CountyPima CountyPinal CountySanta Cruz CountyYavapai CountyYuma CountySome counties will display local vaccine locations and have county-specific registration systems or call-in lines.More vaccine locations and appointments will be available as the state receives more doses and allocates them to counties, providers and pharmacies.Who is eligible to get the vaccine now?Currently, all Arizonans 16 and older are eligible to get the vaccine. Many places require prescheduled appointments, but some locations, including some large state sites, are allowing walk-ins without appointments.The state-run sites are open to anyone 16 and older. Pharmacies and federally qualified health centers are too.The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are approved for anyone 18 and older, and Pfizer for anyone 16 and older. The vaccines may be approved for kids and younger teens in the coming months.All counties are vaccinating those 16 or 18 and older, and some are holding targeted events for essential worker groups or people with high-risk conditions or disabilities, for example.Some counties have targeted efforts to vaccinate frontline essential workers like transit employees or grocery store workers.

But that allowed the hometown fans, including his grandmother,\u00a0to share the moment with him as he swished a 3-pointer at Wednesday's home game.The scoreboard also read \"10-00\" after his made shot, ironically representing the coveted point total.\"It felt really good. It's kind of weird because I thought maybe I would get it like two games ago, and I don't know if the pressure got to me or not, but I started missing shots,\" Farlow said.\u00a0\"It's just a good feeling to finally get it, and then the fact that I got it at home was pretty important to me because all the people I knew where there to support me.\"Farlow, who's averaged about 16 points per game this season and just over 12 points for his career, said he was thankful for the kind words and support he received after the game, especially from those closest to him.He confessed his teammates were probably more excited for the benchmark than he was, as they made it a goal of theirs to get him over the hump earlier in the season, but Farlow knows he couldn't have done it without their help.Head coach Mark Wilson told Farlow he was proud of him. Farlow's father, Joe, who helped forge his love for the game and develop his signature jump shot, was also in attendance as he has been for much of his son's journey.\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling to watch your child set a high goal as this one and achieve it,\" Joe wrote in a text. \"Being undersized and faced guarded most of his career never deterred him from this goal. We couldn\u2019t be more proud of him and character he kept while doing so.\u201d\u00a0Farlow also felt an increased sense of satisfaction knowing the path it took to get here, suffering\u00a0a back injury as a sophomore that sidelined him for a few weeks. Even when he returned, he struggled to work out with his teammates in the offseason and has an overall frustrating relationship with the game.Now, however, he's renewed his enjoyment in basketball and found peace in newfound commitment to his religion, both of which make this all the more special.\"With my spiritual growth, I know that God's been walking with me through this whole journey. And I actually just got baptized Sunday, so it was a really special moment that it could happen this week,\" Farlow said.\u00a0\"It's even more of an accomplishment that I did it after having a back injury and after going through some adversity and battling through that ... it's a cool feeling to get it at the end of the season and the end of my career.\"Farlow now sits ninth on Centerville boys basketball's all-time scoring list, and is the first Bulldog to score 1,000 points since Matt Schauss (2008-2011).The achievement also came in Centerville's (8-12)\u00a0fourth consecutive win, which Farlow also said made it more enjoyable. With just one more regular season contest before sectionals, though, it's unlikely he'll move up further on the school's scoring rankings.Farlow does not plan to play basketball competitively past college, so he's relishing the fun now. It's hard for him to fully look back at the totality of his career at this point, but he knows this moment was just one of many he'll cherish forever.\"I think more so I'm gonna remember my teammates and the people around me that supported me through this time and all the people that I didn't even realize were kind of moved by me playing basketball,\" Farlow said. \"A lot of people came up saying that they enjoyed watching me, and I'm going to remember those people more, I'm going to remember my teammates and playing with these guys more so than I am (scoring) 1,000 points, so that really means a lot to me.\"Gus Martin is the sports and education reporter at the Palladium-Item.

CDC review suggests guidance was influenced by Trump administration\u00a0The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention failed to live up to its once-golden standards by issuing some guidance that wasn't\u00a0primarily authored by its staff,\u00a0didn't rely on the best scientific evidence and used watered-down language\u00a0as the nation confronted the coronavirus pandemic, a new agency review says.The review, requested by new CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and conducted by her principal deputy, Dr. Anne Schuchat, does not allude to interference from the\u00a0Trump administration but nonetheless seems to confirm\u00a0the long-held suspicions of its meddling\u00a0for political purposes.Schuchat noted examples of documents posted on the CDC website last year that were developed or finalized outside the CDC that have since been removed. One from July minimized health risks while emphasizing the importance of reopening schools. Another from August suggested it was not necessary to test asymptomatic people for the coronavirus after they had been in close contact with infected others, guidance that drew a strong rebuke from the scientific community and was revised the next month.\"It is imperative for the American people to trust CDC,'' Walensky said in a statement. \"If they don't, preventable illness and injury can occur \u2013\u00a0and, tragically, lives can and will be lost.\" Spring breakers with 'anything goes' mentality could set off superspreaderAn\u00a0influx of large numbers of spring break revelers in Miami Beach is creating headaches and the potential for\u00a0massive coronavirus transmission at a time when the pandemic is still far from controlled.Because most pandemic\u00a0restrictions have been lifted in Florida, visitors are coming with an \"anything goes\" mentality, said Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber, whose police department made 163 arrests in the last seven days.\"It's like a triple threat: We've got too many people, too many coming with a desire to go wild and we have the virus,\" Gelber said. \"It really poses a multifaceted peril for us.\"The CDC director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, has expressed alarm over the risky behavior witnessed in beach towns and a recent increase in travel around spring break.\u00a0The Transportation Security Administration screened more than 1.3 million people both Friday and Sunday, setting a new high since the pandemic began. Variant first identified in UK is more deadly, according to two\u00a0studiesTwo new studies add evidence that a coronavirus variant first detected in Britain, already known to be at least 50% more contagious\u00a0than the original strain,\u00a0is also more deadly.A new paper published Monday in the journal Nature compared\u00a0cases in more than 1 million people infected in England, and researchers estimated the risk of death was about 55% higher for those with the new variant.\u00a0For men in their 50s or 60s, that meant the risk of death went from 0.06% to 0.09%.In a University of Exeter study published in the British journal BMJ last week, researchers followed about 100,000 positive COVID-19 cases, matching pairs of participants on age, sex and other factors. They also found those with the U.K. variant were at higher risk of death during the study.The variant has been found in all but a few states in the U.S., especially Florida, and is expected to become the dominant strain in a matter of weeks. CDC study: Nearly 90% who get first dose complete two-shot regimenPeople who get a first dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. are nearly certain to return for the second shot, according to\u00a0the first federal study to look at how many are completing the series.A report released Monday by the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed an 88% completion rate among the 12.5 million people in the study, conducted from December 14 to February 14. Another 9% of those who got the first dose still had time to get the booster shot within the six weeks the CDC recommends as the maximum span between doses. About 3% did not complete the series in that time frame.\u201cWe think these findings are really encouraging. The fact that most people are completing the two-dose series to be fully vaccinated shows the system\u2019s working,\u201d said Robin Toblin of the CDC, one of the study\u2019s authors. Texas restaurant owner who took stand on masks\u00a0faces death threats, vandalismSupport is rolling in for a San Antonio man whose Noodle Tree restaurant was vandalized with racist graffiti days after he spoke out against\u00a0Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's decision to rescind a statewide mask mandate.Mike Nguyen appeared on CNN last week, saying his stance was based on the safety of his staff, himself\u00a0and the community. Since that interview, he said he has faced death threats on social media. On Sunday, he arrived at his restaurant to find \"no mask,\"\u00a0\"go back 2 China\" and other hateful messages scrawled in red paint on his storefront.\"I was born here and\u00a0I'm not Chinese,\" Nguyen, whose background is\u00a0half Vietnamese and half French, told USA TODAY on Monday. \"It's not right that as an American I can't state my opinion without being attacked.\"The vandalism came just days after President Joe Biden condemned the violence Asian Americans have endured throughout the pandemic. Neighbors came to Nguyen's aid, helping him clean up the mess. Mayor Ron Nirenberg thanked them, saying the effort \"proved that we're better than this one hateful act.\"The\u00a0Chinese American Citizens Alliance and the Asian American Alliance of San Antonio released a joint statement denouncing the \"ugly display of hate.\" 30,000 deaths later, New York City marks anniversary of first fatalitySomber words and music were set against a backdrop of images of New Yorkers taken during the pandemic as Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday marked a year since reporting the city's first fatality from COVID-19, a fearful moment that sent officials rushing to close businesses and schools.\u00a0\u00a0More than 30,000 New Yorkers have died, a bigger total than the number the city lost in World War II, Vietnam, Sept. 11 and Superstorm Sandy combined, de Blasio said. \"Everyone we've lost, what they did, goes on,\" he said. \"What they contributed, what they created, the love they gave, goes on.\u201dThe city, the state and the nation\u00a0are\u00a0showing signs of renewal.\u00a0Gov.

The\u00a0film\u00a0which, notoriously in these parts,\u00a0did not show or have anything to do with Palm Springs, was a\u00a0hit\u00a0last summer.More:The one thing missing from Andy Samberg's 'Palm Springs' movie? The city itselfThe Best Picture for a comedy went to \"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\" and the Best Actor in a Comedy went to Sacha Baron Cohen for the same movie.\u00a0In one comedic element during the broadcast, actors had pretend Zoom calls with their doctors. Actress Carey Mulligan, who\u00a0received the\u00a0International Star Award, Actress\u00a0from the Palm Springs film festival\u00a0for her performance in\u00a0\"Promising Young Woman,\" told her doctor that she wakes up every morning feeling it's the same day over and over again. Her doctor told her she's got a case of \"Palm Springs,\" a reference to the infinite time loop vibe of the film.Desert resident nominated but does not winGary Oldman, who announced at a recent film festival that he had moved to Palm Springs, did not win Best Actor in a Drama\u00a0for the movie \"Mank\" about Herman J. Mankiewicz, who famously penned the movie \"Citizen Kane.\"Scenes in 'Mank' look familiar?\u00a0That's because it was filmed in California desertThat award went posthumously to the late actor\u00a0Chadwick Boseman for his role in \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.\"\u00a0Oldman's portrayal was excellent and he likely saved on gas mileage with parts of the movie filmed in nearby Victorville, which\u00a0as the movie explains, is where Mankiewicz was when he wrote the famous script.\u00a0Oldman did, however,\u00a0nab the Chairman\u2019s Award, Actor from the Palm Springs film festival for his performance in \"Mank.\u201dPalm Springs film fest honorees get winsWhile the Palm Springs International Film Festival did not exist in its traditional in-person capacity this year, it did still hand out its annual\u00a0awards\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and some of those honorees took home Golden Globes on Sunday, including one of the biggies.\u00a0Andra Day, of the film \"The United States vs. Billie Holliday,\" won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama. She also took home the Breakthrough Performance Award handed out by the Palm Springs film festival.\u00a0Chloe Zhao won the Golden Globe for Best Director for her remarkable film \"Nomadland\" which also won Best Picture.\u00a0She became just the second woman to win the Golden Globe for Best Director.\u00a0She was also given the Director of the Year Award by the Palm Springs film festival.Daniel Kaluuya won Best Supporting Actor in a Drama for his role in the movie \"Judas and the Black Messiah.\" He was given the International Star Award by the Palm Springs film festival\u00a0this year. He won the first award of the night and immediately started talking while on mute, hammering home the unusualness of the night with honorees all chiming in via Zoom.Aaron Sorkin won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay for the film \"The Trial of the Chicago 7.\" Sorkin, along with the cast of the film, was given the Vanguard Award by the Palm Springs film festival.\u00a0The movie \"Minari\" won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

A previous version misstated the web address.\u00a0After nearly four years of planning, the Dreamers Academy is about to become a reality.On Wednesday, leaders for the Sarasota County School District\u2019s new dual-language charter school signed a lease\u00a0to operate from Temple Beth Sholom\u2019s 28,000-square-foot educational complex at the corner of Tuttle Avenue and Bahia Vista Street in Sarasota.\u00a0The school will open this fall,\u00a0using\u00a0a dual-language model in which students take classes in both English and Spanish.School founder and interim principal\u00a0Geri Chaffee is a passionate advocate for dual-language instruction, and she said it is an amazing testimony to children\u2019s adaptability to see how quickly they can pick up a second language.\u00a0\u201cThe teachers use\u00a0 a lot of \u2018show,\u00a0tell, build,\u2019\u00a0which is not just delivering verbally \u2013 it\u2019s using sign language, songs, physical activities, images, videos, so the kids really get an idea of what is going on,\u201d\u00a0said Chaffee, who is serving until a long-term principal is hired.\u201cOur dual-language teachers are trained to ensure that all these kids are engaged and that they are included and celebrated. It\u2019s a very natural process. It\u2019s not like you have a lot of kids who don\u2019t know what is going on and a system that is not equipped to make them feel like they have anything of value to contribute.\u201dMore: Manatee County Schools work to improve communication with Spanish-speaking parentsMore schools coverage: Florida partnering with Sarasota County schools to vaccinate older staffSchool founders hope the student body they attract is a\u00a0mix of students who speak English as a first language and students who are \u201clinguistically diverse.\u201dThat means they could be fluent in Spanish, understand Ukrainian or think in Chinese \u2013 \u201cAny child that has had two languages in the brain,\u201d\u00a0Chaffee said. \u201cThere is a lot of diversity in that group.\u201dThe school will open with 108 spots for kindergarten students and 108 first-graders, and then one class of 18 each for grades two through five. Because dual language works best with young children, the kindergarten and first-grade classes will be dual language immersion courses, and grades two through five will follow a standard curriculum.\u00a0\u00a0As the original two cohorts of dual language students progress, the school will expand its immersion program to eventually be for students in every grade level, Chaffee said.\u00a0Facility searchThe school had to delay opening in 2019 after it failed to secure a facility.\u00a0The School Board officially approved the Dreamers charter in 2018\u00a0after months of back-and-forth, with its plans to open in the fall of 2019. But then came the search for a facility, and then came the coronavirus, causing the school\u2019s opening to be delayed twice.When the Sarasota YMCA announced that it was closing two remaining fitness centers in August\u00a02019, Dreamers tried to buy a large portion of the Y\u2019s Frank G. Berlin campus, using millions in tax-exempt bonds, along with a $550,000 startup grant from the state and another roughly $500,000 in donations.At the time, Dreamers collaborated with Save Our Y, the non-profit that sprung up to preserve the fitness centers, to make what Chaffee described as a \u201cmarket value\u201d offer on the facilities. The deal would have allowed Save Our Y to continue fitness center operations but also allowed Dreamers to operate its new school in the facility beginning in the fall of 2020.\u00a0Sarasota metro home values went up by a third in 2021, more than double the national average Hagen Brody, Mike Cosentino are running for the District 2 seat on Sarasota County Commission Sarasota school board hears concerns over teaching race, limiting speaking time at meetings Federal claims court ruling could impact Legacy Trail right-of-way settlements Looking for fun events in February?

That meant competing with developers for\u00a0properties that could be converted to condominiums.\u00a0Dreamers Academy board member Dan Kennedy said the wait was worth it to get the spot where the school will now reside.\u00a0\u201cThe building\u2019s design, with its high ceilings, large classrooms and exquisite outdoor areas are ideal for the type of integrated and enrichment academic practices that will develop bilingualism and excellence in all our students,\u201d\u00a0Kennedy said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier with the location and the commitment of our landlord.\u201dThe school is accepting applications for the 2021 school year at www.dreamersacademy.org.\u00a0Ryan McKinnon covers schools for the Herald Tribune.

Andy Beshear's one-year budget proposal unveiled Thursday evening during his State of Commonwealth address includes funding boosts\u00a0for K-12 schools, colleges and universities.The budget plan from Beshear, a Democrat, aims to help the state\u00a0recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevented the governor last year from raising teacher salaries and per student spending \u2014 campaign promises popular with Kentucky educators.Apart from education priorities, the budget uses\u00a0$613\u00a0million in one-time funds to provide immediate relief for those negatively impacted by the pandemic and make long-term investments in infrastructure.But Beshear's proposal for the upcoming fiscal year\u00a0may run up against Republicans, who enjoy a\u00a03-to-1 supermajority in each chamber of the General Assembly and can move forward with a budget of their own.Again calling public education a top budget priority, Beshear proposed\u00a0a boost in the state's per student funding rate.More:Gov. Andy Beshear presents state budget plan with direct COVID-19 reliefIt would up the base SEEK rate by $40, bringing it to $4,040 \u2014 a potential state record dollar amount, though it\u00a0could fall just short of the $4,048 rate needed to cover for the current rate of inflation, per the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy.Beshear said the 1% increase is a starting point that will hopefully be followed by greater investment in future budgets. He proposed the same increase last year, which was increased in GOP iterations of the budget before holding flat as lawmakers quickly passed a one-year budget in the face of the pandemic.\u00a0The budget proposal again\u00a0includes raises for educators, albeit smaller than those included in Beshear's recommendation last year. Public school teachers and classified employees, such as custodians and bus drivers, could see $1,000 raises.The teacher salary\u00a0boost, which reflects a 1.9% average increase, would cost about $109 million.\u00a0The average Kentucky teacher\u00a0salary in 2019 was $53,923.\u00a0\"Kentucky\u2019s great educators and school staff have had to overcome incredible challenges this year, quickly adjusting to online instruction when needed and making sure our children were fed even when they weren\u2019t in the classroom,\" Beshear said Thursday during his virtual address. \"One teacher \u2014\u00a0Sarah Blades of Lexington \u2014\u00a0showed true Team Kentucky spirit. She not only helped her students but went above and beyond to help one of their parents earn a GED. Thank you, Sarah, and every educator, for all that you do.\"KY politics:GOP priority bills on abortion, governor's powers speed through legislatureThe governor's budget recommendation fully funds the Teachers' Retirement System and begins the second decade of full funding for retired teachers' medical benefits, including the full amount of the state's portion of the \"shared responsibility plan.\"The state's General Fund will use $62.1 million in fiscal year 2021 and $73.2 million next fiscal year to support the Teachers' Retirement System and medical benefits.For higher education, Beshear's proposal gives an additional $17.3 million to colleges and universities, a 2% increase over current spending levels. The first 1% of new cash\u00a0would go directly to each institution's base budget, and the remainder would go to the\u00a0Postsecondary Education Performance Fund.Beshear's new budget plan will also create the\u00a0Better Kentucky Promise Scholarship, a program that aims to provide the necessary dollars to\u00a0allow nearly 6,300 Kentuckians to complete associate\u2019s degrees or secure certificates.\"Imagine that \u2014\u00a06,300 Kentuckians gaining that educational opportunity that\u2019s going to move all of us forward,\" Beshear said.The scholarship, which is capped at the Kentucky Community and Technical College System tuition rate, could especially help Kentuckians whose jobs and studies have been disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, Beshear said.And Beshear's budget\u00a0sets aside $100 million for the renovation or replacement of crumbling school facilities, some of which were built before 1930.\u00a0\"This will improve the experience of students, educators and staff; it will enhance the surrounding communities,\" Beshear said.\u00a0\"It will also create thousands of construction jobs and unleash a wave of positive economic activity across Kentucky.\"The Facilities Construction Commission would also\u00a0receive authorization to make $100 million in offers of assistance to school districts, an increase from the $58 million in the last budget and a return to an amount school districts had previously seen.Here are more education-related highlights:Pension relief for regional universities, community college systemThe governor's budget adds $19.9 million to support regional universities and the Kentucky Community and Technical College System with funding for additional pension costs for\u00a0employees.The additional funding will cover 90% of the increased costs, per Beshear.Textbooks, transportation,\u00a0mental healthFunding for textbooks was zeroed out in the 2018-20 budget, but Beshear's new proposal sets aside $11 million for districts to buy textbooks and other instructional materials\u00a0\u2014 about two-thirds of what was allocated before 2018.\u00a0Funding for additional, full-time school-based mental health counselors will not change over the previous year's level, under Beshear's plan.Transportation will once again not get money, which can particularly hurt rural districts.Kentucky Education Commissioner Jason Glass told The Courier Journal in a statement \"KDE has long supported full transportation funding, but we recognize the difficult decisions involved with the limited funding the state has.\"\"We are grateful for the SEEK increase of $40 per pupil, and hope it will provide some flexibility to districts to use where necessary,\" Glass said.More:Kentucky Democrats call on Rep. Hal Rogers to resign for siding with 'domestic terrorists'Preschool and early learningJust like last year, Beshear wants $5 million to support preschool programs in disadvantaged areas of the Bluegrass State.And state education officials and advocates will have to wait longer for their desired\u00a0full-day kindergarten funding, as this year's proposal once again does not include money to bump up the state's funding of half-day kindergarten.Teacher loan forgiveness and scholarshipsA teacher loan forgiveness program would be restored thanks to $2.1 million from Kentucky Lottery revenues, under Beshear's proposal.And a need-based teacher scholarship program, which was eliminated in the last two-year budget, will come back with an additional $1 million each year from lottery revenues.More student financial aid,\u00a0support for deaf and blind schoolsBeshear's budget devotes\u00a0lottery revenues to provide nearly $6.5 million\u00a0to support 2,400 additional College Access Award\u00a0and 600 Kentucky Tuition Grant recipients.Funding for a dual credit scholarship program, when combined with the\u00a0dual credit portion of the Work Ready Scholarship program, is expected to support over 46,000 high school students by the end of fiscal year 2022.The budget proposal also includes an additional $1.5 million to support the Kentucky School for the Blind in Louisville and Kentucky School for the Deaf in Danville.Broadband coverageThe budget also provides $50 million to fund last-mile broadband coverage, which could help the tens of thousands of Kentucky students who lack internet access\u00a0amid\u00a0at-home learning and help close the state's \"digital divide.\"\"The experience of our educators and our students during COVID-19 further points to a larger shift that Kentucky must be prepared for and invest in now,\" Beshear said.\u00a0\"The move to virtual classrooms was mirrored in many occupations, especially the use of telehealth, pointing to the growing importance of broadband.\"\u201cWe used to think of broadband in terms of just business,\" Beshear added.\u00a0\"Now we know it touches every part of our lives: the education of our kids, how we receive health care. This is the most important infrastructure of the future.\"How leaders reactedGlass, Kentucky's education chief,\u00a0said he was \"pleased to see Gov. Beshear and Lt. Gov. (Jacqueline) Coleman maintain their focus on education as an investment and a pathway to a better Kentucky.\"\u201cNow more than ever, our students and teachers need these added resources to overcome the challenges we face,\" Glass said in a statement.Glass said he was particularly pleased to see the\u00a0boost in funding for the Kentucky School for the Blind and the Kentucky School for the Deaf.The Kentucky Department of Education said its staff will be meeting with Beshear\u2019s budget staff later this week to go over more details of the budget.\u201cWe are looking forward to working with the governor, his staff and the General Assembly to protect education funding and ensure that each and every student in the Commonwealth can grow and prosper,\u201d Glass\u00a0said.Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, and\u00a0House Speaker David Osborne, R-Prospect, shared their thoughts on Beshear's budget with Kentucky Educational Television's Renee Shaw.\"I am certain that there are many,\u00a0many areas that we will find common ground,\" Stivers said.But Stivers said the Beshear's budget numbers have been artificially inflated by billions and billions of\u00a0money\u00a0at the federal level being infused into our state economy.\"Osborne said the state is \"in a better spot than we'd thought we'd be financially\" but that lawmakers will\u00a0\"take a very, very\u00a0conservative approach\" as they quickly\u00a0put together their desired budget.\"Certainly\u00a0our teachers and state employees are very deserving,\" Osborne said of pay raises in Beshear's proposal.\u00a0\"But I think we also have to acknowledge that there are still tens\u00a0of thousands\u00a0of people that are out of work.\"Kentucky Education Association President Eddie Campbell said Beshear's proposed budget\u00a0\"provides immediate financial relief to schools, prioritizes Kentucky\u2019s citizens and makes significant investments in our collective future.\"\"The Governor knows that the best thing he can do for all Kentucky citizens is to appropriately use the more than $900 million in federal funds that are coming to the commonwealth to timely address urgent issues facing our state,\" Campbell said in a statement.\u00a0\"We are pleased that the proposed budget uses some of those funds for public education. The last nine months have laid bare the inequities created by chronically underfunding public schools.\"\"It is equally important that individual citizens and the small businesses, state agencies and non-profits they rely on for vital services also receive relief. Making these investments today will build a great foundation for Kentucky and will pay dividends for all citizens far into the future.\"Jefferson County Teachers Association President Brent McKim said his group \"applauds the unprecedented investments in public education that Gov. Beshear\u2019s budget proposes.\"\"These investments in our public schools and educators are essential if the commonwealth is to compete successfully in our global 21st century economy,\" McKim said in a statement. \"Thank you Gov. Beshear for keeping your promise to make public education a top priority in all you do.\u201dKentucky School Boards Association Executive Director Kerri Schelling said the \"timely passage of a state budget is the most important task before our legislature\" and to make that investment in \"student-centered programming, for the 90% of Kentucky's children our schools serve, it is imperative that we maintain a moratorium on any new tax expenditures.\"\"The challenges facing our students, greatly compounded by the pandemic, must be met with appropriate funding for instructional resources, personnel and instrastructure,\" Schelling said.Brigitte Blom Ramsey, leader of the Prichard Committee, a nonpartisan Kentucky education advocacy group, said all\u00a0Kentucky families \"need to have the opportunity to live, work\u00a0and learn online.\"\"The Prichard Committee\u00a0sounded warning bells last May\u00a0that a greater broadband infrastructure was needed to move Kentucky from its bottom 10 ranking among the states in high-speed internet access,\" Ramsey said. \"We were pleased to see Gov. Andy Beshear\u2019s budget request for $50 million to fund last-mile broadband coverage. We hope this can be the start of a bold push for Kentucky to be a gigabit state and unlock our full digital potential, and that the Kentucky General Assembly agrees to invest substantially in broadband so that no Kentuckians are left behind. A clear near-term state plan supported by both the governor and Kentucky General Assembly is needed to move our state forward.\"\"One area we did not hear about in the governor\u2019s speech was child care \u2014\u00a0which is so critical to ensuring our youngest get a strong start and families can successfully return to work,\" Ramsey added in a statement. \"Having lost half of Kentucky\u2019s child care providers over the last six years, Kentucky must be mindful about increasing support for this critical part of the early childhood ecosystem.\"Jeni Bolander,\u00a0a leader of the grassroots advocacy group KY 120 United, said \"we have heard many in the Republican supermajority say that they value public education.\"\"Well, the budget is the place to put your money where your mouth is. If the Republican-led legislature wants to show us how much they value public education, it\u2019s time to show us with their budget,\" Bolander told The Courier Journal. \"We remain incredibly thankful for a governor and lieutenant governor who continue to make education, from preschool to college, a priority.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday evening allocated about $11 million in food products to Michigan, which will provide additional food through the summer, said Diane Golzynski, director of the health and nutrition services office at the Michigan Department of Education.\"Before the pandemic our network distributed on average 2.6 million pounds of emergency food every week. Since the pandemic, we've grown our infrastructure and we've been on average distributing 4.5 million pounds of food every week,\" Knight said, adding that the council anticipates high rates of food insecurity to last through June of next year.\u00a0The\u00a0funding supplies food boxes to food banks like Gleaners Community Food Bank, and it's \"absolutely an enabler to our work,\" said Stacy Averill, vice president of community giving and public relations at Gleaners, adding\u00a0that the amount of\u00a0food Gleaners has been getting is significantly higher compared with\u00a0 pre-pandemic months.\u00a0\"The increased distributions that we've done since the start of the pandemic, we can continue those for longer,\" she said. \"And that's critical to our work because we know that the community need is going to continue for quite a while.\"\u00a0Since March, food need has been \"profound and persistent,\" said\u00a0Steve\u00a0Palackdharry,\u00a0communications director for Southwest Solutions.\u00a0By 11 a.m. Thursday at St. Anthony's, Gleaners and Southwest Solutions gave out more than 14,000 pounds of food \u2014 milk, potatoes, frozen meat and pasta \u2014 at a free distribution event. Gleaners had to\u00a0break out an emergency allotment, which ran out by noon, he said.\u00a0The Detroit-based nonprofit has partnered with Gleaners to run weekly\u00a0food drives since the pandemic began. Last year, it ran 30 drives, serving about 12,000 families. That's 400 families each week with about 50\u00a0 vehicles\u00a0 already in line by 9 a.m., when the distribution officially begins.

Andy Beshear, Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman, Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton, state transportation secretary Jim Gray and Emergency Management Director Michael Dossett at the Kentucky Horse Park Tuesday morning to mark the opening of the indoor vaccination site, which will administer the Pfizer vaccine.\u00a0The site, at 4089 Ironworks Parkway in Lexington, opened at 10 a.m. with 600 scheduled appointments for its first day. It will be open\u00a010 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday this week and\u00a0Thursday through Saturday beginning next week.

Beshear is expected to announce more regional locations this Thursday and next.Not all vaccination sites are regional. There are 34 total vaccinations sites in Kentucky.\u00a0The regional sites are meant to be able to handle high capacities and service a larger area.

Eligible recipients also can\u00a0book by phone at 1-833-4-ASK-ODH (1-833-427-5634).For now, the state and federal government have committed to keeping the center open for eight weeks, but officials indicated Monday that could be extended.Cleveland and the site in particular was picked because of its close proximity to ample parking and Interstates 71 and 77 \u2014 and the fact that some 1.1 million Ohioans ages 60 and older live in Northeast Ohio.While the initial online appointments were open to those ages 50 or older and those in special categories set by the state, Ohio Emergency Management Director\u00a0Sima Merick said a special effort will be rolled out soon in and around Cleveland to reach particularly vulnerable populations.Of the some 25,000 residents who live within a one-mile radius of the Wolstein Center,\u00a045% live below the poverty level.And Merick said some of those residents may not have access to the technology or means to make an online appointment.She said the state is working to partner with churches and other social safety net organizations to reach those who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 dangers.Tuesday's \"soft rollout\" of the vaccine will include a visit by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and other federal officials.Brig. Gen. Rebecca L. O'Connor, the Ohio Air National Guard chief of staff, said this initial smaller number of vaccinations\u00a0will allow the 200 Ohio guardsmen and 217 medical personnel from the 101st\u00a0Airborne out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to work out any issues on the logistics.The goal is to get folks in and out as smoothly as possible.\"We don't want people to wait in lines,\" O'Connor said. \"We just don't want people to have to wait for hours.\"The military is hoping lines do not need to extend outside the Wolstein Center, but it is setting up tents for shelter just in case.O'Connor said only those with appointments will be allowed inside \u2014 there will be walkups or last-minute calls for folks to receive a vaccine at the end of the night.The clinic will operate seven days a week and will offer first doses of the Pfizer vaccine during the first three weeks of operations; those vaccinated will automatically receive an appointment to return three weeks later at the same appointment time and day.O'Connor said it is critical that those with appointments not arrive more than a half hour before a scheduled time \u2014 ideally around 15 minutes early\u2014 to ensure there is ample parking and flow of folks coming and going.Once folks arrive at the arena's Gate B, their temperatures will be taken.O'Connor said you will not be allowed to enter if your temperature is above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.Everyone will be required to wear a mask.There will be a socially distanced line along the\u00a0concourse leading to the arena floor,\u00a0where some 480 chairs are set up.Once vaccine recipients are seated, personnel will officially check folks in and the shot will be administered by Army medics. After the vaccination, people will be asked to remain seated for a bit to ensure there are not\u00a0adverse reactions.O'Connor said the goal was to make the operation run seamlessly and not require a bunch of different stations.Once a row of those vaccinated leaves, crews will disinfect the seats and the next batch of recipients will be brought in.There will be a separate entrance, Gate A, for those with special medical needs or any potential language barriers.O'Connor said personnel fluent in five languages, including sign language, will be on hand.And for those who speak languages other than Spanish, Mandarin, French and Russian, there are computer terminals to assist with some 240 different languages.Those partnering on the vaccination clinic include the\u00a0Ohio Department of Health, Ohio National Guard\u00a0and Ohio Emergency Management Ageny,\u00a0with support from FEMA, the U.S. Department of Defense, the City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County and Cleveland State University.CSU President\u00a0Harlan\u00a0M.\u00a0Sands said it is impressive to see the transformation of the arena in just a few short days after the university\u00a0wrapped up its winning season and earned a berth to play in the NCAA Div.

Similar sites opened last month in Albany, Clarkesville, Hapeville and Macon.\"All sites will become operational on March the 17th in advance of an additional expansion of vaccine eligibility criteria in the second half of this month,\" Kemp said. \"...

Wayne\u00a0Schmidt, R-Traverse City, voted with Democrats on what became the most controversial amendment of the day.\u00a0\u201cToday the Senate Republicans left $4 billion dollars on the table in federal resources meant to get our kids back in school, keep families in their homes, and ramp up vaccine distribution and testing,\" said Whitmer press secretary Bobby Leddy.\"The legislation includes language that could mean Michigan gets fewer vaccines from the federal government, and hampers our ability to provide COVID-19 testing to student athletes, nursing home residents, and keep our state safe.\u00a0Today\u2019s actions by the Senate Republicans also mean the state could run out of funding for food assistance for Michigan families by the end of March.\"More:Senate bill strips race, wealth as factors for COVID-19 vaccine distributionMore:Thousands of Michigan renters await federal rent aid amid pandemicThe bill as passed would force the state health department to stop using something called the Social Vulnerability Index in determining how to divvy up vaccines. The index weighs many factors, including race, gender and socioeconomic status, in determining\u00a0how many vaccines communities should receive.\u00a0There are far fewer doses available than demand for those shots. But the index does not determine who can receive a shot, rather only the number of doses going to a specific community.\u00a0\u00a0On Wednesday, Senate Republicans amended a bill to take away the state's ability to use this index. They argued it unfairly allowed people to jump the line for vaccines, but Democrats said the change would delay helping\u00a0communities more at risk of dying.\u00a0Democrats on Thursday introduced an amendment to essential undo the work Republicans did in committee.\u00a0The idea prompted fierce debate. State Sens. Jim Runestad, R-White Lake, and Tom Barrett, R-Charlotte, said the change is about fairness and refuted allegations of racism.\"Ironically, I've been accused of being a racist for including language that says you cannot discriminate on the basis of race. If this is not an emperor-has-no-clothes moment, I don't know what would be,\" Barrett said on the Senate floor.\u00a0\u00a0Wednesday evening after the committee hearing,\u00a0Democratic Sen. Erika Geiss, D-Taylor, tweeted:\u00a0\"This right here is a bunch of racist bulls--t and they know it.\" She joined Democrats in blasting the GOP-backed move Thursday.\u00a0\"Maybe we should just change the name of the index to make it more palatable for you,\" Geiss said.\"It's absolutely unconscionable that while we are using the social vulnerability index to protect the very people who got the virus the most, who were the most vulnerable, still are the most vulnerable, and it happens to be people of color \u2026 all of a sudden you're, like, racially aware?\"Sen. Rosemary Bayer, D-Beverly Hills, tweeted during the Senate session:\u00a0\"Racism is alive and well in the Michigan Senate.\"State Sen. Stephanie Chang, D-Detroit, tweeted Thursday about the Social Vulnerability Index, explaining how the measure would distribute vaccines all across the state.\u00a0\"Don't let ignorance & racism get in the way of serving your residents,\" Chang tweeted.\u00a0Republicans continued to say the change prioritizes older people, not those who are younger but may be deaf, have intellectual disabilities or other factors weighed by the state. They referenced new rules in Detroit that would allow some people not eligible in other areas to be vaccinated.\u00a0\"We need to prioritize, and that priority needs to be those 60\u00a0and above, so that we are getting the vaccines out to those most at risk,\" Stamas said later in the debate.\u00a0More:Older people the focus of new COVID-19 vaccination clinics in Wayne, Macomb countiesMore:3.7% of COVID-19 vaccines went to Black Michiganders as state aims to boost that rateThe state recently reported only 3.7% of those vaccinated in Michigan have identified as Black. While the state still lacks similar data for more than 40% of state residents vaccinated, leaders argue more work needs to be done to ensure equity.\u00a0That includes Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who's worked on a task force examining vaccine distribution.\u00a0\"It\u2019s odd that Senate Republicans think they know better than our nation\u2019s top epidemiologists and infectious disease experts when it comes to the science and data of protecting our most vulnerable residents,\" Gilchrist said in a statement Wednesday evening.\u00a0\"Black and brown communities have been disproportionately affected by the virus and improving the race and ethnicity data being collected for vaccinations is critical for ensuring the vaccine's equitable administration.\u00a0We will continue to implement plans to vaccinate the people of our state equitably.\"\u00a0Changes to vaccine distribution policies would only take effect if this bill became law. States anticipate receiving substantially more vaccine doses in coming weeks, meaning the proposed change, if enacted, may have little impact on distribution: more doses means likely means less acrimony over divvying them up.Republicans also defeated amendments that would provide more funding for schools, people facing evictions and testing. Stamas argued there is hundreds of millions in the bill for all of these efforts, and delaying providing all of the available funds would increase oversight and accountability.\u00a0There's no indication if or when the House will take up either Senate measure, if the Senate will consider bills from the lower chamber, or if the governor will approve any bill that makes it to her desk. \u00a0Contact Dave Boucher: dboucher@freepress.com or 313-938-4591.

Godzilla\u2019s path of destruction leads him into conflict with Kong, who\u2019s been transported off Skull Island so that his allies \u2013 including geologist Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgard) \u2013 can take him back home to Hollow Earth, a mythical locale in the center of the planet.Wingard chats with USA TODAY about steps he took to make this monster mash memorable:.Godzilla and Kong: By the numbers\u00a0With the thunder lizard standing at 393 feet tall and the big gorilla (who\u2019s grown since \u201cSkull Island\u201d) just a bit shorter at 338 feet, both could dunk on the Statue of Liberty. In their faceoffs, Wingard tried to abide by \u201cthe rules of the actual size of the monsters\u201d so much so that when it was first mentioned that Godzilla and Kong would tangle on an aircraft carrier, \u201cI thought that's just pushing it too far\u201d due to their sheer size alone.\u00a0But Wingard found out how large those ships\u00a0actually were and it made scientific sense both could be on it at the same time. \"How cool is it that we get to see Godzilla get punched in the face by King Kong on an aircraft carrier? We'll do anything to figure out how to make that work, but we also want it to be believable on some level.\u201dGet ready for a most epic sea battle\u00a0Wingard felt the topography itself needed to be an important part of the action, which is why Godzilla tussles with Kong at sea. \u201cIt's less interesting if you just put the monsters in a big field,\u201d he says. \u201cThere's nothing for them to use and so it's just going to be two monsters bumping into each other.\u201d Having terrain like the aircraft carrier also adds wrinkles to the fight as Kong tries to stay out of the drink:\u00a0\u201cFirst off, you already have Kong at a disadvantage. He's not as powerful as Godzilla. Godzilla's unstoppable. Godzilla can swim in the water and he can breathe underwater. You take Kong and he's totally out of his element there.\u201dBruce Willis and WWE were influences?The director thought of Godzilla as The Undertaker, the pro-wrestling character and fearsome loner who comes and goes to take on enemies when he needs to. Yet for Kong, Wingard looked to Bruce Willis\u2019 John McClane, even giving the big guy a dangerous\u00a0jump that's also a \u201cDie Hard\u201d homage in the film. \u201cHe's this \u201980s action-hero archetype,\u201d he says of Kong.\u00a0\u201cJohn McClane is this awesome cop, but it's like one guy versus a bunch of terrorists.\" And like Willis' good guy, Kong's in a little over his head though he isn't totally outgunned.Insert: an ancient ax\u00a0Kong does get a leg up on his competition when he finds an ancient ax that not only foils Godzilla\u2019s\u00a0fiery atomic breath, but its\u00a0business end is made from one of the reptile\u2019s own dorsal fins. The weapon is an \u201celement of the past war between Kongs and Godzillas. We don't know who won one way or the other, but we know that something happened and it was pretty messy,\u201d Wingard says. \u201cYou want to show things that people haven't seen. And I couldn't think of anything that would penetrate Godzilla's flesh other than a piece of Godzilla.\u201dThe human stories boost the titans\u2019 taleLike in \"King of the Monsters,\" Madison and her dad (Kyle Chandler) are in Godzilla\u2019s corner, while Kong has MonsterVerse newcomers Nathan, linguist Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) and the gorilla\u2019s young deaf best friend Jia (Kaylee Hottle) in his.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to make sure that they represented what was misunderstood about the monsters,\" Wingard says. But\u00a0even with \u201call these great actors\u201d in the film, \u201cthere's just no way that they can overshadow Godzilla and Kong because these characters are just so powerful and that's what people are coming for.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/06/01/deaf-basketball-player-makes-mississippi-history-scholarship/5288356001/", "headline": "Deaf basketball player makes Mississippi history with scholarship", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 7:39 a.m. ET June 1, 2021 Updated: 1:20 p.m. ET June 1, 2021", "text": "A Jackson student has become the first deaf player to sign a Division 1 basketball scholarship in Mississippi.Alexis Roberts, a 6-foot forward with more than 1,000 career points and 500 rebounds, has signed to play for the Jackson State Tigers.\u201cI feel very excited because I am the first deaf person to do that, and it\u2019s great to make history,\u201d Roberts said through interpreter Cheryl Keller.ROBERTS MAKES THE CUT:Meet the 2021 Clarion Ledger All-State girls basketball teamBEST IN THE STATE:Meet the 2021 Clarion Ledger All-State boys basketball teamRoberts, who was also recently named to The Clarion Ledger's All-State basketball team, was born with a percentage of hearing in both ears, but her hearing faded.

That\u2019s more common. We encounter that more than someone who is hearing-impaired or deaf. But whatever the case is, motorists in New Jersey know they have to have their documentation prepared: license, insurance and registration,\u201d Peele said.\u201cWe do have ways to communicate,\" he said. \"More often than not the driver knows why they were stopped and what the interaction is for. Usually you can strike a balance and communicate one way or another.\u201d\u00a0Police departments are bound by the Americans with Disabilities Act, the U.S. Justice Department advises law enforcement on its website, and communications with someone with hearing loss \u201cmust be as effective as your communication with hearing people.\u201dThe Justice Department recommends the use of qualified sign language or oral interpreters, speaking loudly and clearly, assistive listening devices, and gestures or visual aids to supplement oral communication.

Users can\u00a0answer a phone call by double-clenching their\u00a0watch hand, and they can activate the watch's Motion Pointer by simply shaking their hand.The Cupertino, California-based\u00a0tech giant's announcement of these new\u00a0features arrives before the 10th annual\u00a0Global Accessibility Awareness Day\u00a0on Thursday, which\u00a0focuses\u00a0on promoting digital access and inclusion for more than 1 billion people worldwide living with disabilities and impairments.\u201cWith these new features, we\u2019re pushing the boundaries of innovation with next-generation technologies that bring the fun and function of Apple technology to even more people \u2013\u00a0and we can\u2019t wait to share them with our users,\u201d said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple\u2019s senior director of global accessibility policy and initiatives.More\u00a0Apple updates coming for those with disabilitiesSome of the Apple software features for those with disabilities coming this year:iPad users will have more\u00a0access to third-party eye-tracking devices that\u00a0make\u00a0it possible for them\u00a0to control their iPad just by using their eyes.\u00a0New Made for iPhone bi-directional hearing aids with microphones that will help\u00a0those who are hearing- impaired\u00a0have\u00a0hands-free iPhone and FaceTime\u00a0conversations.New background sounds to help minimize distractions and\u00a0allow\u00a0users to focus, stay calm\u00a0or get some rest.More updates\u00a0to VoiceOver, a screen-reader for the blind and low-vision communities.\u00a0This includes\u00a0more details about what's in an image.

But on-screen success somehow eluded him until Darius Marder's electrifying hearing-loss drama \"Sound of Metal\" (streaming on Amazon Prime), nominated for six Academy Awards including best picture, best actor (Riz Ahmed) and best supporting actor (Raci).\u00a0The Oscar nod \"really is life-changing,\" says Raci, who nearly slept through the announcement on nominations morning. \"To go from where I've been and doing what I have to do to pay my mortgage: going to court every day and being a sign-language interpreter, then every once in a while, getting a shot in a film.\"This is different because now, I'm turning roles down,\" he adds. Plus, \"I'm bringing some content to Amazon and we're in discussions about widening the awareness of disabled and deaf actors.\"\u00a0\u00a0'Sound of Metal':How Riz Ahmed worked to honor deaf culture\"Sound\" follows a young punk-metal drummer named Ruben (Ahmed) who suffers from sudden hearing loss and reluctantly enrolls in a remote commune for recovering deaf addicts, run by the stern yet gentle Joe (Raci).\u00a0Although he can hear, Raci's parents were both deaf (his dad was born deaf, while his mom lost her hearing when she was 5). Like Joe, Raci is a former addict who's worked in sober homes similar to the one depicted in \"Sound.\" The character was originally written as an Iraq War veteran but was changed to reflect Raci's own experience serving in Vietnam from 1969-73.\u00a0\"I didn\u2019t know Paul fought two tours in Vietnam when I watched his (audition) tape, but I felt it in his eyes,\" Marder says. \"I didn\u2019t know he had struggled with addiction himself but I didn\u2019t doubt his words for a moment. I didn\u2019t understand his complex and deep connection to deaf culture but Paul\u2019s conviction was pure and alive, coming from a deep and sometimes painfully acquired truth.\"\u00a0We caught up with Raci over Zoom from his home in Burbank, California, where he lives with his wife and daughter when he's not fronting Hands of Doom, an American Sign Language Black Sabbath cover band.\u00a0Question: Were you the kid who practiced his Oscar speech in the mirror or was acting something you hadn't even considered growing up?\u00a0Paul Raci: It was in my mind \u2013\u00a0I remember watching the Oscars as a kid. But the thing for me was, I was always put in this position of storytelling. When my mother took me to the movies in 1956 to see \"Love Me Tender\" with Elvis Presley, what I didn't realize is I'd\u00a0have to interpret that whole movie for her while I was sitting there. There was no captioning, no accessibility for deaf people for pop culture.\u00a0Years later, my dad liked to watch \"Bonanza\" on television and I'd interpret all the characters for him.Then I was into rock 'n' roll. My mom bought my first tickets to see the Beatles, but on one condition: When I got back, I had to explain the whole (concert)\u00a0to her.\u00a0She just drank it all in.\u00a0Q: What was the first professional acting gig you ever booked?\u00a0Raci:\u00a0My very first movie was (\"Rent-a-Cop\")\u00a0in 1987 with Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli. I had one line, it was to Burt Reynolds. He was sitting over there and I was the bartender, and I go, \"Tony! Phone call!\" That was it. And from then on, it was downhill, my friend!\u00a0Q: Why do you think it's taken 40 years for you to find a role like Joe in \"Sound of Metal?\"\u00a0Raci:\u00a0When I graduated from the University of Illinois, I sat down with my acting teacher, Bill Raffeld.\u00a0I go, \"Bill, what's next for\u00a0me?\" I'm all excited. And he says, \"Paul, I don't think you're going to have any success until you're much older.\" I said, \"Nobody wants to hear that! What are you talking about?\" So\u00a0he sent me to Second City to be\u00a0an improvisational actor. He said, \"Get another tool to put in your box and just be patient.\" He just passed away last year and now this thing has happened.\u00a0So I don't know how to explain it, other than when I moved to Hollywood, I was already 40 years old. I tried to fit in as best I could until finally\u00a0I just gave up. I'd say to my wife, \"I must be way too specific because they're certainly not looking for me.\" Once I let go of that and became more of myself and didn't care anymore, then this thing kind of metamorphosized\u00a0into a role for Paul Raci.\u00a0I think that might have been what my old acting prof was talking about.Oscars 2021:Could Anthony Hopkins overtake Chadwick Boseman? And more questions as final voting beginsQ: There's a powerful scene between Joe and Ruben (Ahmed) when Joe tells him to leave the sober house after breaking the rules. How did you approach that moment?\u00a0Raci: A great acting teacher once told me, \"You gotta fight those tears. If you cry, then the audience won't cry.\" So you can see Joe fighting and fighting, but he's fighting for his own life and everybody in that sober house. When Ruben has to leave, I remember thinking, \"God, I want to run out there and bring him back.\" But I couldn't do that.\u00a0We knew we weren't going to get a lot of takes and our hearts were out there on that kitchen table. I remember looking up and there was Darius Marder, our director, tears just streaming out of his eyes. And Riz Ahmed broke my heart. ... God, if I never have another acting experience, that's the ultimate one right there.\u00a0Q:\u00a0Joe believes that deafness\u00a0\"is not a handicap. Not something to fix.\" Did your parents share that view?\u00a0Raci: No. You\u00a0have to\u00a0understand in the '50s, all we knew was, \"Your parents are deaf. They're hearing impaired.\" Then\u00a0I moved to Los Angeles and met the great Ed Waterstreet, who established Deaf West Theatre. He\u00a0was of the opinion that there's nothing to fix here. And I started to see young deaf actors say, \"I'm\u00a0perfect and complete as I am.\u00a0If you don't know American Sign Language, who's the one impaired here?\" They started to turn it back on the hearing community. So that is a shift I've seen from growing up: watching my parents feel oppressed by the hearing man, to\u00a0now deaf people being empowered with their own identity.\u00a0That's very refreshing.\u00a0"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/06/09/staunton-community-helps-woman-move-into-her-apartment-and-they-didnt-even-know-her/7617172002/", "headline": "Deaf teacher moves to Staunton and strangers from Facebook help ...", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 3:52 p.m. ET June 9, 2021 Updated: 4:36 p.m. ET June 9, 2021", "text": "STAUNTON \u2014 Virginia Beach is from Louisville,\u00a0Kentucky.

She was also concerned that being deaf may be an obstacle in terms of communicating with people in a new city and trying to coordinate any help she needed.She only knew one person in Staunton; a friend who urged her to apply for the job at VSDB.Beach reached out last month to a Facebook group in hopes of getting some help. She wanted to get the lay of the land before she moved: figure out which bank to use, where to get internet from, where to live and so on.\u00a0She\u00a0posted in the Staunton VA Facebook group and to her surprise, received a lot of comments on people aiding in her questions regarding moving to Staunton.She had a lot of questions.\"It was really great, you got treated like family,\" she said. \"People really wanted to help.\"The social media platform worked well to get to know some members of the community.She was feeling discouraged as her moving date was closing in and couldn't get a moving company to load up her things and deliver them to Staunton. The company was telling her they didn't have drivers, but she was on a timeline \u2014 she had to be out of her home by the end of the week and in Staunton by June 10. The company she was using told her the day before they were set to come pick her stuff up that they couldn't do it.\"Right now I am at the end of my rope,\" she posted.\u00a0\"This whole experience has been stressful and nerve-wracking and left me riding an emotional roller-coaster, and now with this new information from the moving company, I am about ready to just fall apart.\"So right now I could use a little strength and support, comfort and compassion\u00a0and maybe a little magic,\" she continued in the post.\u00a0\"I need someone to tell me that it will all come together and I will soon be in Staunton and happily settled in my new apartment.

All were wearing name tags so Beach could identify them. She was concerned that without an interpreter it may be difficult to communicate, but she said people were trying their best to talk with her and she was reading lips.\u00a0\"I was like, you don't even know me,\" she said. \"We've never met and you're going to help me get my stuff into my apartment? I was flabbergasted. This doesn't happen in big cities, but it's happening here.\"Beach barely had to lift a finger. She said she carried in maybe one box, but then people were telling her to relax and they would do it.They were done in a matter of hours. Beach said people were filtering in and helping as long as they could, then returning to work. Then a new set of people joined in to help.\u00a0At the end, there was a group of about six people that gathered in a circle in her apartment and did a small blessing.Read This:Fighting for her life: Mom, MMA fighter battles her demons as she aims to reach the pros\"It was just people coming together,\" she said. \"First of all, I was so touched by the whole thing. I was trying not to break down in tears.\"There are no words to express my deepest appreciation for that,\" she continued, fighting the emotion.Beach said she knew that even with the interactions she had on Facebook with people from Staunton that it was a special place.\u00a0\"I think this was just a reminder that even a pandemic can't stop love, it can't stop people caring about each other ... and being a community,\" she said. \"I think what I saw yesterday was a true example of community.\"Also:Girl, 12, died following a weekend crash in Augusta CountyMike Tripp, local photographer, was driving through downtown grabbing photos when he noticed a U-Haul being backed up to The Beverley.

And everyone there seemed excited to be welcoming her to the Queen City.\"This is what makes Staunton ...

Marsh was unable to help physically with the move \u2014 she's had some falls in the past weeks and can't carry anything. Instead, she created a care package for Beach with some essential items like paper towels, toilet paper, tissues, garbage bags, post-it notes and more.More:West side stories: Author, publicist calls west end home for decadesMore:Staunton curbside recycling to cease in July, but for some it hasn't been around for awhileMarsh was the one who came up with the idea for name tags and a list where people could share their name, email and information so Beach could contact them if she needed to.\u00a0\"To be new in town, it always helps to have resources,\" Marsh said.\u00a0\"We have a deep love for Staunton. There are such good people living here. Virginia, through her postings, exhibited such a lively personality and just radiated goodness.

He picked the language up, casually learning new words,\u00a0and eventually became an interpreter.

Being the only ASL teacher at the school this year, Holland is still teaching a mix of in-person and remote students, so he has to remember to stay behind his desk where the students tuning in through Microsoft Teams can see him. On top of that, the required face coverings make communicating via ASL, which relies heavily on facial expressions to communicate grammar, more difficult.Know any amazing teachers?:Nominate them here\u201cI\u2019m still here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining.\u201dMuch of Holland\u2019s class is project-based. Simpler projects are things like, describe your pet. More complex ones involve telling a children\u2019s story or signing a song. This year, he asked his more advanced students what they want to learn \u2014 and now they\u2019re all working on \u201croasts,\u201d or short speeches making fun of Holland in creative (but appropriate) ways.And it works.

The following article reveals the ending of \"A Quiet Place Part II.\" Stop reading if you have not seen the movie, now in theaters.It's the end of the world, but the kids are all right.\u00a0In the final scene of John Krasinski's postapocalyptic horror thriller \"A Quiet Place Part II\" (now in theaters), the deaf Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and her younger brother Marcus (Noah Jupe) step up and become the heroes of the movie, protecting the adults from the talon-clawed, razor-toothed monsters that are terrorizing Earth.\u00a0Fleeing the creatures following a deadly rampage, Regan and fellow survivor Emmett (Cillian Murphy) find shelter inside an abandoned radio station, where Emmett comes\u00a0face to face with yet another alien. Knowing the monsters' hypersensitivity to sound, Regan\u00a0hooks her hearing aid up to the radio tower, creating a strident noise that temporarily paralyzes the beast before Regan fatally beats it\u00a0with a metal pipe.\u00a0'A Quiet Place Part II':John Krasinski recounts the scariest scene for wife Emily BluntThe piercing feedback is successfully broadcast across the countryside, where Marcus and their mom, Evelyn (Emily Blunt), are backed into a corner by a\u00a0monster inside an old steel mill. Just as the creature looks primed to kill the injured Evelyn, Marcus picks up a rifle and fatally shoots it.\u00a0The kids'\u00a0parallel acts of bravery pack a powerfully poignant punch, given that Regan and Marcus' dad, Lee (Krasinski), was brutally killed by an extraterrestrial at the end of the first \"Quiet Place,\" released in 2018.\u00a0\"The events leading up to this were quite horrific, so I think for her, it was very emotional,\" Simmonds, 18, who is deaf, tells USA TODAY through an interpreter, via Zoom.\u00a0\"Regan felt that she had to take over her dad's role now that he's gone and be sure her family survives. She ultimately wanted to do him justice, and that was her guiding point in helping navigate this world and develop as a young woman.\"\u00a0Adds Jupe, 16: \"It's a huge moment for Marcus, of him almost becoming a man. He's very fearful, but this is him being brave and trying to do what his dad would have done.\"\u00a0The young actors admit their empowering final moments\u00a0looked decidedly\u00a0less cool in reality. Because the CGI aliens were digitally added later, Simmonds was sometimes thrashing at thin air on set.\u00a0\"If it was a straight-on shot, there was nothing there,\" she says. \"But if they could, they'd bring in an actor in a green suit and he'd act everything out. They'd also bring in a soft pillow, so when I'm hitting him with a pipe, I'm obviously not hurting a real human being. I was just beating a pillow.\"\u00a0Jupe, meanwhile, had never shot a gun before.\u00a0\"I remember that being a big worry for me,\" he recalls with a laugh. \"I practiced once and then they were like, 'OK, we're going to do it properly.' So I just remember being like, 'Is it gonna recoil? What's gonna happen when I shoot? Is it gonna explode?' It was quite an interesting experience shooting a gun for the first time.\"\u00a0Marcus spends much of the film hiding inside a bunker and caring for his newborn sibling, played by twin babies who \"were better (behaved) than me,\" Jupe jokes. His character is sidelined early in the movie by a horrific foot injury, after Marcus runs into a bear trap while trying to escape a monster.\u00a0\"I lost my voice because I screamed a lot that day,\" Jupe says of shooting the gruesome moment, which calls to mind the equally squirmy scene when Evelyn steps on an exposed nail while walking down stairs\u00a0in the first movie.\u00a0\"John was like, 'We're gonna give you the nail of \"A Quiet Place 2,\"' Jupe recalls.\u00a0\"I remember what a huge reaction the nail got in the first one, so if this was the equivalent, I was happy it was happening to me, which is kinda strange.\"\u00a0Krasinski wrote\u00a0and directed both \"Quiet Place\" movies, but will be handing off duties to filmmaker Jeff Nichols (\"Take Shelter\") for an already announced third film, which has been dated for 2023. Jupe says he hasn't had any discussions yet about returning for No. 3, but remains hopeful because \"Marcus still has a ways to go on his journey. Now that his mother is injured as well (after being gashed\u00a0by a monster), he's having to deal with that and carry on from there.\"\u00a0There's more story left for Regan, too.\u00a0After learning that a radio signal has been broadcasting Bobby Darin's \"Beyond the Sea\" on an endless loop,\u00a0Regan spends much of the sequel away from her family searching for the signal's source. She eventually finds it on an island that's occupied by other survivors. (The aliens, thankfully, can't swim.)\"I have my own speculations of what may happen (next), but we haven't talked,\" Simmonds says. \"We don't know whether or not the next film would focus on new characters, or perhaps the same family. I think with a potential third film, there's so many opportunities and so many things to uncover. There's a lot of material to work with for a third film, so absolutely fingers crossed.\"\u00a0"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/04/10/pueblo-west-deaf-comedian-hayden-kristal-viral-tiktok/7162460002/", "headline": "Deaf Pueblo West comedian Hayden Kristal goes viral on TikTok", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published 7:01 a.m. ET April 10, 2021", "text": "Way out in the sticks of Pueblo West, a transplanted viral sensation has been drawing national attention for their connection to animals and comedic wit.Hayden Kristal, a professional standup comedian and public speaker who came to Pueblo County from Brooklyn in New York City nearly two years ago, is the definition of an animal lover and has\u00a0the receipts to prove it."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2021/06/14/st-augustine-record-honors-henry-white-sr-commitment-service-florida-school-deaf-blind/7686358002/", "headline": "Henry White Sr. spends 60 years giving back to the community that ...", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published 10:24 p.m. ET June 14, 2021", "text": "10 Who Make a DifferenceToday: Henry White Sr.Editor\u2019s note: This is the first story in The Record\u2019s annual \"10 Who Make a Difference\" series during which we highlight a volunteer who has made a significant impact on our community.Henry L.

She is a nurse practitioner.Organizations across the Valley held vaccine events for underserved communities, including people with disabilities after many\u00a0have faced a lack of access and barriers to getting the COVID-19\u00a0vaccine in Arizona.\u00a0Among the 1,150 people expected to be vaccinated at South Mountain Community College on Saturday was Valerie Duckett. She talked to The Arizona Republic as she sat in the designated recovery zone in the school's gym, minutes after getting her first and only dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.Registration tables were set up just outside the gym, after which point individuals joined a line snaking around the gym leading to the vaccination stations. There were five vaccination tables, each with two Walgreens employees administering the vaccines.Duckett said she had a good experience at the event, adding that it only took her about 15 minutes from the time she showed up until she got her shot.\"This is very efficient,\" she said. \"Everybody's super nice. They made it very easy.\"Anabell Castro Thompson, a nurse practitioner, volunteered in the recovery area on Saturday and said there were many Spanish-speaking patients.She said she and many other nurse practitioners around the country have been getting involved with efforts to address vaccine accessibility and equity.\"We understand what it takes to engage communities and we're happy to lend our expertise and our time to efforts such as these,\" she said.\u00a0Duckett knew she wanted the Johnson & Johnson vaccine because she didn't want to carve out time for an appointment twice and risk side effects from a second dose.\u00a0Prior to learning about the event, the result of a collaboration between Equality Health and the HeroZona Foundation, Duckett said she had a difficult time trying to find a convenient appointment.Throughout the pandemic, she has\u00a0worried about potentially exposing her high-risk mother to the virus. Both of them were vaccinated\u00a0Saturday, which Duckett said gives her \"more peace of mind.\"\"It's kind of nice just to feel that relief and you've done your part to not only save yourself, but other people,\" Duckett said.She wore two masks and said she is still \"nervous\" about leaving her home during the pandemic, but said getting the shot would mean she could gradually get back to some of the activities and people she's missed for more than a year.The experience was also meaningful to Aura Jessica Ruiz, a Walgreens pharmacist and pharmacy manager who\u00a0assisted with the effort.\"This is my area, these are my patients, these are the people I see every single day,\" she said. \"I'm so happy to be a part of this so we can make sure we try to break some of the barriers that we see in these communities to have access to the vaccine.\"She said she hoped events like the one on Saturday, which included many bilingual staff,\u00a0would help those individuals\u00a0in particular, feel seen, heard and supported through the pandemic.\"Just because they might not speak the language or they might not have the resources doesn't mean we don't want them to have that opportunity as well,\" she said.Ruiz said having vaccination events specifically target underserved individuals will have a sweeping impact when it comes to community health and eventually moving out of the pandemic. She specifically mentioned the larger family size that's common in communities like hers, emphasizing that a vaccinated family member\u00a0can help protect others while also encouraging them to get vaccinated themselves.\"Everything counts,\" she said. \"This little small community can make a huge difference.\"Ruiz encouraged the public to make use of resources and pharmacies in their area to get accurate information about the vaccine and the options they have to receive it. She hoped that more and more people would decide to get their shot.\"Any vaccine that\u2019s available to them is the best vaccine, and that's the only way we can actually get back to what we used to think normal life was,\" she said.Castro Thompson, Equality Health's senior vice president of health equity, said \"we are sacrificing equity for speed\" oftentimes when it comes to vaccine distribution, causing lower vaccination numbers among diverse communities. That trend is why she feels it's so important to bring the vaccine to those communities.\"We're bringing people in the community that look like them so we can foment trust and decrease misinformation and myths and ensure they're getting the right information,\" she said.Mistrust rooted in the four-decade\u00a0Tuskegee study, as well as other examples of medical exploitation\u00a0and mistreatment, has contributed\u00a0to a\u00a0greater hesitancy of getting the COVID-19 vaccine among Black Americans. They have received disproportionately fewer doses of the vaccine but have\u00a0disproportionately\u00a0higher rates\u00a0of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, experts say.USA TODAY reported results of a\u00a0survey by Voto Latino\u00a0in March, which found that almost 73% of Latino people surveyed knew someone who had COVID-19, and a third knew someone who died of the illness.Despite that, just shy of half \u2013\u00a047% \u2013\u00a0said they were reticent about getting the shot. Around a quarter said they would not take it at all.Equality Health first held a vaccination and testing event three weeks ago at Cortez Park, then held another one last week at Isaac Middle School and then moved to South Mountain Community College for Saturday's event.Equality Health Foundation spokesman Tomas Leon said they were finalizing plans with the state and county to make it a permanent vaccination site open from Monday through Saturday.There was no shortage of staff at the site on Saturday, with nearly 40 volunteers, 15 Sonora\u00a0Quest Laboratories staff to handle COVID testing, 20 Walgreens staff to administer vaccines, 15 Phoenix Fire Department personnel and 10 Equality Health staff to oversee the operation.Vaccinated and test positive?

Advocates also said people with disabilities were not part of the rollout plans for the vaccine.\u00a0Because of the\u00a0lack of access, McEntire said these communities came together to put on the event\u00a0to show\u00a0\"how easily accommodations and disability concerns can be taken into concern for all vaccination events.\"\u00a0Organizers said 2,000 people were registered to be vaccinated between the two-day event, where individuals received their first vaccine dose. Another event will be held to provide the same people with their second dose May 1 and 2.\u00a0Beca Bailey, 47, got vaccinated at the Ability 360 event along with her husband, David Bailey, 56, and son, Myron Zartman-Bailey, 22, who are all deaf and live in west Phoenix.\u00a0\"I kind of had mixed feelings about doing it, but I felt like for the good of the community I needed to do it, to protect everyone,\" said Beca, who also works for the commission, in sign language.\u00a0Myron told The Arizona Republic that\u00a0information about vaccines \"has not been clear nor available in an accessible manner, so to have this event fully accessible is what it should be all along.\"\u00a0\u00a0He also said getting the vaccine is the easiest way for everyone to \"be on the same page\" and help each other out.\u00a0Beca and Myron said people with disabilities should have been \"at the table\" to provide consultation for an equitable event from the start and that health organizations could have included a request for accommodations in online vaccine registration forms.\u00a0One of the first large-scale events to provide COVID-19 vaccines for people with disabilities in the Valley came after advocacy organizations spoke with state officials about the lack of inclusion and barriers faced by people who are disabled in getting a vaccine.\u00a0By having the proper procedures and processes in place, McEntire said people with disabilities will feel more comfortable registering for and going to a vaccine appointment at any\u00a0site so they don't have to wait for a separate event like this.\"Remember when we\u2019re talking about\u00a0our communities, whether it's deaf or hard of hearing or other disability communities ...\u00a0we are a part of the larger society,\" McEntire said. \"When we think of pandemics and public health emergencies, we all need to do a better job of integrating our communities into the larger issues.\"\u00a0McEntire added while there will always be a need for standalone events, the overarching goal is to show they don't have to be mutually exclusive.Arizona Republic reporter Dan Gonzales and USA TODAY reporter Nada Hassanein contributed to this report.Reach the reporter at bfrank@arizonarepublic.com\u00a0or 602-444-8529.\u00a0\u00a0Follow her on Twitter @brieannafrank.\u00a0Support local journalism.

Senate bill S3434, co-sponsored by state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Sen. Dawn Addiego, was passed in March.On Thursday, the state Assembly passed its own version, A5366, sponsored by Assemblywomen Pamela Lampitt\u00a0of Voorhees and Englewood's Valerie Vainieri Huttle and Madison's Assemblyman John McKeon.

That\u2019s what we find out in \u201cA Quiet Place Part II,\u201d the sequel to John Krasinski\u2019s monster hit \u2014 pun intended \u2014 that creeped out everyone who saw it when it was released in 2018. It\u2019s kind of a shame they\u2019ve made another one, because the ending of the first film was perfect, truly memorable, brimming with confidence on the part of the character and the filmmaker.But if you have to make another, this one fits the bill. It\u2019s squirmy good fun \u2014 agonizing in places, in exactly the ways you want it to be. The first film was at heart a family story with horror elements. This one fiddles with that balance a little bit, as it expands the enclosed world of the story. But the importance of keeping a family together never wanes.Nor does the horror of living this way and the consequences if you don't.Krasinski handles action sequences with skillIn the original, hideous monsters have invaded; they tear apart everyone they can find. In fact, that\u2019s all they do. Why? There really isn\u2019t a lot of time to think about why, which seems like the proper and appropriate reaction. Just try to stay alive.That\u2019s best done in both movies by keeping quiet, because the monsters can\u2019t see. But boy, can they hear. In the first film Lee (Krasinski) and his wife Evelyn (Blunt, who is married to Krasinski in real life) and their children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe) have carved out a silent existence for themselves. Regan is deaf so the family knows sign language, which comes in handy.But Evelyn is pregnant, and infants don\u2019t really respond to requests to stop crying, even if it means instant death. Krasinski expertly played with all of these dynamics.That film started out in the middle \u2014 the invasion was well underway and Lee and Evelyn had adjusted to a new normal as best they could.At the beginning of \u201cA Quiet Place Part II\u201d we learn how everything went down. Which was fast. An idyllic small-town little league baseball game instantly becomes a nightmare. Krasinski handles the surreal action sequences with great skill. The speed with which the monsters move once they\u2019ve heard something is disorienting. But unlike the climactic battles of every Marvel Cinematic Universe film, you can tell what\u2019s going on.Which is bad stuff. Really bad.In the present, which kicks off where the original ended, the family has to figure out a way forward. That means leaving their compound. They meet up with Emmett (Cillian Murphy), an old friend who has lost his family. He is holed up in an abandoned foundry \u2014 everything is abandoned. It offers some protection from the monsters, but friends or no, he\u2019s not interested in guests.Simmonds gives another standout performanceSimmonds, so good in the first film, is even better in the sequel.Regan has her dad\u2019s courage and knowhow; in the first movie she\u2019s the one who figures out the feedback from her cochlear implants is torture for the monsters. Now, when Regan learns that a single song is playing over and over on a radio frequency, she thinks it\u2019s a clue to a potential solution, so she sets out in search of it. When Evelyn realizes this she implores Emmett to find her and bring her back.Their journey is the heart of the film. Krasinski works overtime juxtaposing their challenges with the ones of those who stay back at the foundry. At first it\u2019s kind of interesting. Then it becomes odd; eventually it\u2019s annoying.Ah, but the way he shoots those challenges. Enclosed spaces become safe harbors but also claustrophobic nightmares. You practically gasp for air. Other times you squirm or grit your teeth. Krasinski takes great delight in tormenting his audience. Audiences who see this movie will be appreciative of that.Simmonds, who is deaf in real life, is even better in the second film than she was in the first,\u00a0with an expanded role she dives into. Like everyone, she has to do a lot with a little when it comes to acting, given the circumstances the characters find themselves in. She nails it, often with nothing more than a glance.The film was supposed to come out in 2020, just before the pandemic broke out. Krasinski was doubtless disappointed, but in some ways the film is more relevant now.\u00a0 For the last year we\u2019ve been fighting a horror so unimaginable we can\u2019t really wrap our heads around it. But we adapt, we circle our families and those closest to us and we do what we can to survive.There will almost certainly be another sequel to the film. Let\u2019s hope there\u2019s not another one in real life.Johnny Mathis doesn't know why he's seen as the Voice of Romance This Phoenix chef served me the strangest meal I've ever had Scotch & Soda to open its 1st Arizona store Waste Management Phoenix Open's most memorable moments'A Quiet Place Part II' 4 starsGreat \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Good \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Fair \u2605\u2605\u2605 Bad \u2605\u2605\u00a0Bomb\u00a0\u2605Director: John Krasinski.Cast: Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, Cillian Murphy.Rating:\u00a0PG-13 for terror, violence and bloody/disturbing images.Note: In theaters May 28.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com.

That means\u00a0out-of-state\u00a0travelers visiting New Jersey or residents returning home from travel will no longer have to quarantine for a period of time whether they are vaccinated or not.\u00a0The governor asked that everyone use \"common sense\" when traveling domestically and follow local health and safety protocols.\u00a0Key COVID-19 metrics, including\u00a0hospitalizations and cases, have plummeted since early April.More than 3.7 million people were fully vaccinated as of Monday in New Jersey. But the\u00a0pace of vaccinations has slowed so much that Murphy may not be able to make his goal of 4.7 million fully vaccinated by the end of June.\u00a0New Jersey still ranks fourth among states in the COVID death rate per capita over the past seven days, according to CDC data.\"A little bit longer here and we accelerate our ability to drive this virus into the ground,\" Murphy said.He signed an executive order Monday to eliminate his outdoor mask mandate, a pledge he made last week.Large retail and grocery chains including Walmart, Costco, Target and Trader Joe's said they would allow vaccinated people to go maskless in their stores. Other chains, including\u00a0CVS, Home Depot and\u00a0Macy\u2019s, said they would still require masks.\u00a0And California on Monday announced that fully vaccinated residents will have to wear face coverings in most indoor settings for another month, as the state will wait until June 15 to adopt the CDC guidance.Murphy tried to get support for keeping the mandate in place.

Our war against it is not yet won.\"And he urged people not to forget the more than 7,100 Kentuckians who died from COVID-19 over the past 15 months. He noted Friday marked the last time he would read off the ages and counties of those who had died.\"Let's remember\u00a0that those just aren\u2019t ages or counties or genders,\" Beshear said. \"They are irreplaceable\u00a0Kentuckians that\u00a0will be missed by their families\u00a0and their communities.\"He added: \"Reading ages and counties of those we have lost almost daily is the hardest thing I have ever done.\"Citing significant declines in new deaths and infections from COVID-19 along with a steady increase in vaccinated Kentuckians, Beshear said he will end the regular COVID-19 briefing\u00a0that he initially held daily as cases\u00a0 began to surge.\u00a0The briefings and some of the actions\u00a0by Beshear, a Democrat, drew criticism, chiefly from\u00a0Republicans who control the House and Senate and hold all other five constitutional offices. But others said they appreciated regular updates, particularly in the early days of the pandemic when people were hungry for news about the rapidly spreading virus.More:As Beshear prepares to lift COVID-19 rules, Supreme Court hears cases on governor's powersNow, 460 days and 250 news briefings later, Beshear said he's ready to look ahead,On Friday, he was alternately upbeat and reflective as\u00a0he described the progress Kentucky has made, particularly with vaccinations, but considered\u00a0the toll it has taken with more than 471,000 people infected with COVID-19 since March 2019.He also briefly mentioned the controversy generated by some of the restrictions, such as the mask mandate, or protests by those opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine.\"What we have done as a people should not be diminished\u00a0by the noise,\" he said. \"It is nothing short of amazing.\"Beshear used the event to celebrate what he described as the accomplishment of Kentuckians who joined the effort to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to thank his staff for efforts to fight a virus that in the early days was little understood.Among those he recognized were Dr. Steven Stack, state public health commissioner;\u00a0Eric Friedlander, secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services;\u00a0J. Michael Brown,\u00a0his cabinet secretary;\u00a0and LaTasha Buckner, Beshear's chief of staff.He also praised Virginia Moore, executive director of the Kentucky Commission on the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, for her regular appearances at his briefings to provide an interpretation in sign language and who\u00a0became a celebrity in her own right.Stack, who also appeared frequently at Beshear's news conferences,\u00a0spoke Friday and drew laughter over his comments about the final COVID-19 briefing.Gerth:Mr. Rogers, Marcus Welby and access: Why I'll miss Gov. Andy Beshear's COVID briefings\"It is good to be here, but it's also good to be here for the last time,\" he said.Stack urged\u00a0Kentuckians to thank everyone involved in fighting COVID-19, in particular officials with local health departments.\"I hope you all express your gratitude to them for the work that they have done to\u00a0 keep us safe,\" he said.And Stack\u00a0highlighted the importance of the\u00a0COVID-19 vaccines that first became available in late December as the best tool against ending the pandemic.\"These vaccine are amazing,\" he said.One recent incentive Beshear announced appears to\u00a0be catching on.Nearly\u00a0370,000 vaccinated Kentuckians have entered the state's \"Shot at a Million\" incentive program for their shot at $1 million or a free college education,\u00a0Beshear said Friday.He launched the Shot At A Million initiative on June 4, which will make three Kentuckians 18 and older millionaires and provide free college education for 15 youths ages 12 to 17.The orders Beshear signed Friday include one that lifts the mask requirements with a few exceptions, including public transit, health care settings and nursing homes. People who have not been vaccinated are encouraged to keep wearing masks in public.The order was largely symbolic in that most stores, gyms, restaurants, churches and\u00a0 other settings already have begun to lift the mask mandate for people who are fully vaccinated, under recent guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Beshear did not lift his order declaring a public health emergency despite calls from some Republican leaders for him to do so.More:After 16 months, Gov. Andy Beshear's last COVID-19 briefing is Friday. Here's a look backAt a press conference of Republican Senate leaders Thursday, Sen. David Givens, R-Greensburg, called on Beshear to immediately declare an end to the state of emergency in Kentucky, saying the majority of states have set a firm date for when their emergency will end.\u201cWe cannot continue to operate in a declared emergency and move this state forward the way it should move, when other states are ending pandemic unemployment assistance, no longer have mask mandates,\u201d Givens said.Beshear said Friday some federal pandemic aid programs including a $96 million grant for vaccine distribution and administration require the state have a declared public health emergency.He said his administration is studying which assistance programs require such an emergency order and he won't lift it until he's certain it won't\u00a0cost the state any federal money.Reporter Joe Sonka contributed to this story.\u00a0Deborah Yetter at dyetter@courier-journal.com or 502-582-4228.

This award must be re-named.\u201dThat\u2019s what the letter says.\u201cThis is especially important at this moment in our national life when the nation is examining institutional racism more closely than ever,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cThe (alumni association) proposes the award be re-named \u2018The Raymond P. Crowe Sportsmanship Award\u2019 after Coach Ray Crowe, who coached the great Crispus Attucks boys basketball teams of the 1950s.\u201dThe Crispus Attucks National Alumni Association sent that letter nearly two months ago to IHSAA Commissioner Paul Neidig and the IHSAA\u2019s 19-member executive committee. I can confirm: The letter was received.\u201cWe encourage you to join us in this endeavor and hope you will recognize the great opportunity the\u00a0IHSAA has to take the initiative and announce the name change without public pressure,\u201d is how the letter heads toward conclusion. \u201cWe would love to jointly announce this long-overdue name change.\u201cWe look forward to hearing from you by June 1, 2021.\u201dThat was May 1.The IHSAA didn\u2019t respond. Not on June 1. Not until\u2026Well, I\u2019ll tell you.IHSAA: Making up rules as it goesArrogance is within the IHSAA\u2019s character.This is an organization that has conducted its student-athlete transfer hearings the same way for decades, led by attorney Robert Baker, whose behavior has been described by the State Department of Education as \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201cbullying,\u201d and by one state judge as \u201cinsulting and condescending.\u201d That same judge, Patrick J. Diener of Marion County, accused Baker\u2019s methods as \u201cbad faith and bullying,\u201d while a second state judge has written in court documents: \u201cNo reasonable person would come to the conclusion that the IHSAA Review process comported with or provided fairness to the Plaintiffs.\u201dEarlier this year I asked the IHSAA commissioner, Neidig, why he allows his attorney to treat families this way.\u201cMr. Baker has done a good job representing this association for over 30 years,\u201d Neidig said.Oh.More:Doyel: The truth behind Attucks, Trester & the IHSAA's top awardOp-ed: IHSAA's mental attitude award has troubling name. Here's a better one.Doyel: Inside the IHSAA's broken transfer systemOf course the IHSAA tried to ignore the Crispus Attucks National Alumni Association\u2019s letter. Neidig and Co. are keeping in character, and that includes another letter they received last week, a letter written with class and pain, describing two paradoxical decisions the IHSAA made before this month\u2019s state track meet \u2014\u00a0one that allowed a white athlete who hadn\u2019t qualified to compete at state, and another that kept out four Black kids who\u2019d been mistakenly disqualified after winning at sectional. Our David Woods has written about both:\u25ba\u00a0The (white) pole vaulter from Westfield failing to qualify for state out of her regional but being mistakenly told she had made it, and ultimately being allowed to compete there. Neidig told Woods he did it \u201cin favor of the kid.\u201d It was, if you\u2019re asking me, the right decision.\u25ba The (Black) relay team from Pike that won the Southport Sectional but was DQ\u2019d by an official\u2019s error \u2014\u00a0a mistake confirmed by clear video evidence that no foul occurred. The official notified the IHSAA of his mistake and asked that Pike\u2019s relay team be allowed to advance. Pike coach Courtney Bishop met with Neidig to request the same, but was turned down. It was, without question, the wrong decision.More:Westfield vaulter who didn't qualify for state wins medalIHSAA track: Pike says relay was disqualified because of 'a lie'Last week, a Lawrence Township schools administrator (Kris McAloon) married to a Pike assistant athletic director (Kendra Champion-McAloon) wrote a letter to Neidig and the IHSAA\u2019s predominantly white executive committee that noted: \u201cThe results bear evidence of systemic racism and institutional bias perpetuated by the IHSAA.\u201dAn IHSAA official told me that\u2019s not the case, saying IHSAA rules leave the commissioner powerless to overturn a disqualification that was upheld by the appeal board on site, as was the case with the Pike relay team, but that Rule 16:3 allows the commissioner to take action as he did with the Westfield pole vaulter. My reading of that rule, however, shows only the ability to correct an error when a student is ruled \u201cineligible due to an administrative error\u201d \u2014\u00a0not when the student is mistakenly added to the field.In other words, Neidig bypassed his rulebook \u201cin favor of the kid\u201d at Westfield \u2014\u00a0but wouldn\u2019t do the same for the kids at Pike.As McAloon\u2019s letter notes: \u201cWhen a decision is made to allow an athlete who did not qualify to compete, two weeks after a decision was made to not allow another set of deserving athletes to compete, it raises concern.\u201dThe letter continues:\u201cCommissioner Neidig and the IHSAA may view these as unrelated instances and disregard the racial implications of the outcomes. Unlike Commissioner Neidig, the members of the Pike 4x400m relay do not have the luxury of ignoring race. The lens of racial inequality is something that black adolescent males must live with daily. For many, the fair and impartial competition offered by high school athletics offers an honest arena whereby one can be judged by performance alone. The stopwatch doesn\u2019t know the color of your skin or the neighborhood you represent.\u201dIt concludes:\u201cWhat steps (are) the IHSAA taking to address the disproportionate impact of bias and racism on minority student-athletes within Indiana High School Athletics? Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to engaging in a conversation about the integrity of our sport and steps that the IHSAA can take to ensure fair and equal outcomes in future contests.\u201dThat was Tuesday, June 15.The IHSAA never responded.Ray Crowe deserves it more than\u00a0Arthur TresterChange could be coming.The IHSAA Executive Committee\u2019s informal summer retreat is scheduled for Thursday, when members will lay the groundwork for changes to be considered at its official summer meeting Friday. And guess what\u2019s on the retreat\u2019s agenda?Discussing the name of the Arthur L. Trester Mental Attitude Award.I didn\u2019t say \u201cchanging\u201d the name. I said discussing it. But Paul Neidig, after ignoring the letter from the Crispus Attucks National Alumni Association for nearly seven weeks, indicated his executive committee was willing to discuss the award\u2019s name after I called to raise the question Friday. Is that why this is happening? Because public pressure is mounting, same as it did in 1942 when the IHSAA finally granted Attucks membership?Can\u2019t tell you that, but based on who the IHSAA has been for 100 years \u2013 and who it has been under Paul Neidig\u2019s leadership \u2013 it\u2019s what I believe.Check this out:The IHSAA received the Crispus Attucks letter on May 1, as I\u2019ve said. The letter gave the IHSAA a month to consider the proposal \u201cwithout public pressure.\u201d After the month passed, then nearly three more weeks, the IHSAA hadn\u2019t responded as of Friday. That\u2019s when the IHSAA received some public pressure in the form of my phone call, asking about that letter.Hours later \u2013 this was 4:04 p.m. on Friday \u2013 Paul Neidig finally responded to Attucks.\u201cFirst of all, let me apologize for my late response. As a follow-up, it is my intention to discuss your letter and the subsequent request to change the name of Arthur L. Trester award with my board of directors next week at a scheduled meeting. I will follow up with you post meeting.\u201dThere. Was that so hard?Thing is, the IHSAA has had this topic on its radar for a year. Its executive committee discussed the Trester Award last summer, after the Star wrote about the decades-long battle between Crispus Attucks and Arthur Trester, toying then with the idea of renaming it for Ray Crowe or Crowe\u2019s most famous player, Oscar Robertson.IHSAA employees have gone through Trester\u2019s published comments and even looked for surviving relatives for clues about his mindset. Was his stance on Crispus Attucks racially motivated? Or did he keep out Attucks from 1927-42 only because he considered it a de facto private school, as IHSAA officials want to believe, similar to Catholic schools and the Indiana School for the Deaf?Change happens slowly \u2013 it took the IHSAA seven weeks to answer a damn email \u2013 but the IHSAA can join the 21st century. As Speedway author Phillip Hoose noted in an IndyStar Op-ed in January: \u201cUnlike other states, Indiana has no statues of Confederate generals. We do, however, have a doleful history of bigotry, crowned by our eager embrace of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. \u2026 Now, at a moment in our national life when we examine racism more closely than ever, the Trester Award has become our statue of a Confederate general. It should be renamed. Here\u2019s an idea: How about the Raymond P. Crowe Award for sportsmanship?\u201dAt Crispus Attucks, they created the Ray Crowe Initiative to seek that change. The 10-person group meets regularly to discuss next steps, including the above-mentioned letter sent May 1 by Rachelle Ball-Phifer, president of the alumni association. It last met on Wednesday, by Zoom. Hoose is a member; he was on there. So was Dr. Stanley Warren, a 1951 Attucks graduate and retired professor of education and dean of academic affairs at DePauw.Ray Crowe:Trailblazer, hero, icon, to be honored with elementary school in WhitelandI was on the Zoom call as well, an observer\u00a0hearing the hurt \u2014\u00a0the bewilderment \u2014\u00a0that the IHSAA hadn\u2019t responded to Attucks\u2019 letter more than six weeks earlier.\u201cYou didn\u2019t even answer,\u201d Ball-Phifer was saying at one point, talking to the group but really, in her heart, to the IHSAA. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have the respect to respond, even to say: \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to do that.\u2019\u201cBut if not now, when? Never?\u201dNever is a very long time. Thursday, however, is approaching. The IHSAA executive committee will gather. The Trester Award will be discussed.An organization that struggles to correct its mistakes without public pressure is feeling it now: Remove the segregationist\u2019s name from its top individual trophy, and replace it with someone who truly excelled \u201cin mental attitude, scholarship, leadership and basketball ability.\u201dDo the right thing, IHSAA. Rename the Arthur Trester Award after a hero from Crispus Attucks. The public is speaking. The pressure is mounting. And you\u2019ve been wrong for nearly 100 years.Find IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at www.facebook.com/gregg.doyel."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/06/expanded-hybrid-nantucket-film-fest-honor-kelsey-grammer/4968956001/", "headline": "Kelsey Grammer of 'Cheers' and 'Frasier' headlines Nantucket Film ...", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 12:00 p.m. ET May 6, 2021 Updated: 4:39 a.m. ET May 7, 2021", "text": "Expanding for the first time from six to 12 days, Nantucket Film Festival will next month offer virtual, drive-in and \u201cgarden\u201d movie screenings while honoring and hosting more than a dozen film, TV and literary celebrities.Actor Kelsey Grammer (TV\u2019s \u201cFrasier\u201d) will receive the festival\u2019s Compass Rose Award for Career Achievement, while Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino (\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d) will receive the Excellence in Television Writing Award, according to an announcement today.The June 17-28 festival will screen 25 features and 32 short films in its hybrid format necessitated by COVID-19 precautions.

Listen to \u2018Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\u2019\u00a0by Ray CharlesFrom classic rock titans like the\u00a0Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd and\u00a0Tom Petty, to pop stars such as Gloria Estefan, Pitbull and Ariana Grande, Florida has produced a long list of wildly successful musicians \u2013 with one of them, Jimmy Buffett, creating an entire brand based on the Sunshine State. None, though, are\u00a0as singularly talented as Ray Charles. Of course, lots of folks\u00a0associate Charles\u00a0with Georgia because he was born there, in Albany, and recorded the definitive version of the\u00a0Hoagy Carmichael\u00a0standard \u201cGeorgia on My Mind.\u201d But Charles\u2019 mother came from Greenville in Florida\u2019s Madison County, and that\u2019s where she raised her son after giving birth to him on Sept. 30, 1930.\u00a0Blind by the age of 7, Charles\u00a0attended\u00a0the\u00a0Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind\u00a0in\u00a0St. Augustine in the late \u201930s and\u00a0\u201940s and then lived in\u00a0Tampa while\u00a0working as the piano player in\u00a0a band called the Florida Playboys.\u00a0\u201cStrangest job I had in Florida\u00a0\u2013 and one of the nicest\u00a0\u2013 was with an all-white country-and-western band. All-white, that is except me,\u201d Charles recalled\u00a0in his bestselling autobiography \u201cBrother Ray.\u201d \u201cThey called themselves the Florida Playboys.\u201dA gifted singer,\u00a0pianist, composer and arranger, Charles rose to prominence in the 1950s with his pioneering amalgam of\u00a0blues,\u00a0jazz,\u00a0gospel\u00a0and R&B. In the early 1960s, he reached an even larger audience by revisiting the style of music he played with the\u00a0Florida Playboys. Released in 1962, \u201cModern Sounds in Country and Western Music\u201d went gold with sales of more than 500,000 in its first three months and Charles became a superstar.\u00a0\u201cModern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2\u201d came out six months after the first volume and sold just as well. Charles would continue to have country hits through the 1970s and \u201980s. \u201cMany people are confused about my decision to do country music,\u201d Charles explains in his autobiography. \u201cThey think ABC dictated to me. They think ABC produced these albums for me. Not true. For better or worse, the records were my ideas. Anyone who knows me understands that I really like this music.

The\u00a0modern Orthodox Jewish\u00a0school was\u00a0then in Paterson but has since moved to Paramus.\u00a0Bennett, 49, was sworn in on Sunday. In the days since, a picture of his third\u00a0grade class at Yavneh, taken in 1981, has been circulating online. In the black-and-white photo, a\u00a0pensive looking Bennett\u00a0is wearing\u00a0a striped shirt and\u00a0sitting\u00a0smack in the center of his\u00a0classmates, back in the days when he still had a full head of hair. \u00a0\u00a0The collective intellectual prowess of the\u00a0class is notable: Among its distinguished alumni\u00a0are Adam Szubin, a\u00a0former acting U.S. Treasury secretary; Jeremy Dauber, a\u00a0professor of Yiddish language and culture at Columbia University; and Matthew Hiltzik, a PR consultant who has represented such celebrities as Hillary Clinton, Katie Couric and Don Imus.\u00a0Dena Kinstlinger became an accomplished ballerina.The class had \"many strong personalities\" and\u00a0highly motivated students, their now-retired teacher, Phyllis\u00a0Arnauer, told The Record and USA TODAY Network in an interview. Four decades later, she still recalls\u00a0the probing questions asked by Dauber and Hiltzik,\u00a0as well as a\u00a0beautiful poem that Zubin wrote,\u00a0entitled\u00a0\"The Snake.\"But she\u00a0couldn't remember\u00a0anything about the pupil who recently made headlines in Israel. Bennett, who lived in Teaneck at the time, would spend\u00a0only two years at the school, from 1979 to 1981, before his family returned overseas.\u00a0Who is Naftali Bennett?:A look at Israel\u2019s next prime minister, after Benjamin Netanyahu is oustedHiltzik said Bennett arrived at Yavneh and \"made friends with all of us in our tight-knit group really fast.\" He was \"a likable kid\" who was \"comfortable with everybody.\" Many of the classmates remain in touch today, he said.\u00a0Bennett would\u00a0return to New York years later to make a fortune as a tech entrepreneur before moving back to Israel. He launched his political career in 2006, as chief of staff to\u00a0Netanyahu,\u00a0then head of the opposition party. He later led\u00a0ministries including education, economy\u00a0and defense for\u00a0Netanyahu.\u00a0A fragile coalitionNow, Bennett\u00a0faces the toughest challenge of his career,\u00a0maintaining an unwieldly\u00a0coalition of the Israeli right, center and left that toppled Netanyahu after years of political stalemate. Bennett, a nationalist known for hardline stances on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, describes himself as \"right-wing.\"The coalition\u00a0includes an Arab Islamic party, an openly gay minister, the first deaf\u00a0minister and the highest number of female ministers in an Israeli government. Under a power-sharing agreement brokered with centrist Yair Lapid,\u00a0Bennett will serve as leader\u00a0for the next two years and Lapid for the following two.\u00a0Bennett, who regularly wears a kippah, or yarmulke,\u00a0is Israel's first publicly\u00a0Orthodox prime minister. But he has angered some ultra-Orthodox parties by joining forces with\u00a0secular and left-wing groups. The government was elected by only one vote in the Knesset, and Bennett was heckled as he accepted the victory.'New Nazis':Paterson shop's swastika banner, aimed at Israel, provokes outrage at homeThe new prime minister rose to power as an uncompromising supporter of Jewish settlements in West Bank territory that Palestinians claim as their own homeland; he has in the past\u00a0vowed to do \"everything\"\u00a0in his power to block Palestinian statehood and advocated targeted killings of\u00a0Hamas leaders.But he and Lapid have also agreed to focus on domestic issues like the economy, rather than contentious policies that might split their alliance.\u00a0\"We will forge\u00a0forward on that which we agree, and there is much we agree on ... and what separates us we will leave to the side,\" Bennett said in his first speech as Israeli leader.\u00a0Ardent fans in New JerseyMiles away in North Jersey, Bennett has ardent fans, including Joshua Annenberg, a Teaneck attorney\u00a0who met him when he spoke in Manhattan about Israeli politics.Annenberg brought his then-teenage children \"because I wanted them to meet a leader of the Jewish people who stands for religious Zionist values. It's a tremendous moment when Israel has a prime minister that is Sabbath-observant and wears a kippah,\" he\u00a0said.\u00a0Bennett was born in the Israeli port city of Haifa to American parents,\u00a0Jim and Myrna,\u00a0who moved\u00a0to Israel\u00a0from San Francisco after being inspired by Israel's victory in the Six-Day War of 1967. They spent a few years abroad, first in Montreal, where they became more religiously observant, and\u00a0then came back\u00a0to the U.S.\u00a0Like Netanyahu, Bennett lived and studied in the United States in his youth, honing his English skills and his understanding of Israel\u2019s closest ally. His father's job brought the family to New Jersey when he was in the second grade.Memories in TeaneckThey\u00a0formed close friendships\u00a0with\u00a0Dianne and Stanley Bekritsky of Teaneck, who lived near their Sussex Road home. Stanley recalled commuting into New York\u00a0with Jim Bennett, who\u00a0worked as an emissary\u00a0for the Jewish Agency, which helped\u00a0people who wanted to move to Israel.\u00a0Long before it was in vogue, Jim Bennett spent time investigating\u00a0his family genealogy, Bekritsky remembered.\u00a0\"He was very excited because he discovered that his ancestors fought [for the union]\u00a0in the Civil War.\"\u00a0The Bennetts were warm and friendly neighbors, he said: Before they returned\u00a0to Israel, Jim stopped by to give Bekritsky his unused bus tickets to Manhattan.\u00a0\u00a0Basheva Goldberg said she and her husband, Murray, befriended\u00a0the Bennetts in Teaneck as well, remembering their\u00a0\"strong Jewish, Zionist values.\"Naftali, the youngest of three Bennett boys, was \"funny, lively, smart and fun to be with,\" she said. He\u00a0became a fixture in the Goldberg\u00a0home, where he played sports and board games with their kids.\u00a0Israel-Palestine conflict:Antisemitic attacks rise in New York area as tensions erupt over Israel-Gaza conflictBennett recently appeared on the \"Behind the Bima\" podcast of Goldberg's son, Rabbi Efrem Goldberg, leader of the Boca Raton Synagogue. The two men reminisced about their decades-old friendship, and the rabbi asked the politician what he learned from his time in America.\u00a0\"Only when I was in America did I fully appreciate what it means to be Israeli,\" Bennett answered. \"I missed Israel very much when I was in Teaneck. It was very meaningful, especially in terms of deepening my understanding of how important it is to have a strong Jewish identity.\"In the late 1990s, Bennett and his wife, Gilat, a pastry chef, moved to New York. He founded Cyota,\u00a0an anti-fraud\u00a0software firm, which he sold in\u00a02005 for $145 million.\u00a0While living in Manhattan, they joined\u00a0Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun on the\u00a0Upper East Side. It's the same\u00a0synagogue that\u00a0Israel's new president, Isaac Herzog, attended,\u00a0according to its spiritual leader, Rabbi Chaim Steinmetz.The two men \"exemplify the deep connections between the United States and Israel,\" he said in an interview.\u00a0Herzog\u00a0was a congregant from\u00a01975 to 1978, while his father, Chaim Herzog\u00a0was Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. He\u00a0attended the Ramaz School, a modern Orthodox co-ed high school in Manhattan,\u00a0where he was elected class president and student council vice president.\u00a0Herzog, whose father also served as Israeli president, was a charming and popular student, a real \"people person,\" said Rabbi Haskel Lookstein, principal emeritus at\u00a0Ramaz.Herzog was elected\u00a0Israel's 11th president by the Knesset earlier this month. The role is largely ceremonial and intended to\u00a0promote unity among Israeli citizens.\u00a0The fact that both Israeli leaders spent critical periods of their early lives in America immersed in Jewish life wasn't lost on American Jews this week. Friends took pride that\u00a0their yeshivas had\u00a0become a breeding ground for Israeli\u00a0leaders.\u00a0Barak Schecter, who grew up in West Orange and moved to Israel\u00a0as an adult, met Bennett when he was running for a seat on the City Council in Beit Shemesh. The two are still close, with both marveling at their shared Jersey roots.Schecter described Bennett as a \"down-to-earth\" but \"meticulous\" politician\u00a0who sees everyone\u00a0as an equal, regardless of social or religious background.\"He is an honest, stand-up guy who loves Israel\u00a0and the Jewish people,\" he said. \"Honestly, he's\u00a0one of the better people\u00a0on the planet.\"\u00a0Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified Bennett's grade in a class picture circulating online. He was in third grade, not second.\u00a0USA Today Staff Writers\u00a0Jotam Confino and Deirdre Shesgreen contributed to this article.Deena Yellin covers religion for NorthJersey.com.

But the deal erased his previous first-degree murder conviction and life sentence, and immediately qualified him to go home for the first time since he was 21.Gray seemed overwhelmed about his next turn, rubbing his forehead and crying softly as Judge Margaret Van Houten ended the Zoom hearing in a Detroit courtroom. A mask dangled from his right ear.\u00a0\"This is a happy day,\" Gray told the judge from prison 200 miles (320 kilometers) away. \"Sometimes justice is blind, and sometimes justice is hard of hearing. But if you touch justice, sometimes it works. And so this time the system worked.

His latest filing in March revealed that a witness to the robbery now says two other people were responsible.But another witness still insists it was Gray who was the gunman, a conflict that the Wayne County prosecutor's office felt it couldn't ignore.Prosecutor Kym Worthy, however, agreed to set aside the original conviction and allow a no-contest plea to second-degree murder. Gray did not admit guilt but did not contest the charge. His nearly 50 years in prison amounts to enough time served on the new conviction.\"We wish him well,\" Worthy said.Gray's attorney, Gabi Silver, told the judge that the result of the '73 trial has been frequently challenged over four decades.\"I am really grateful and happy for Ray,\" Silver told the judge. \"He will get to have some life in the world with his family and his wife.\"Valerie Newman of the prosecutor's office, who looks at wrongful conviction claims, said the victim's brother, Marvin Bryant, had no objection to the deal with Gray.\"Of course he misses his brother terribly,\" Newman said. \"He also thinks that Mr. Gray, even if he was the perpetrator, has done more than enough time.\"Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwritez\u00a0\u25ba Stay connected and stay informed.

They include an open letter by the Venice Heritage non-profit organization, signed by celebrities including musician Mick Jagger, actress Tilda Swinton, filmmaker Wes Anderson and director Francis Ford Coppola.\u201cVenice is suffering, and we, citizens of the world, cannot remain deaf to her cries,\u2033 read the open letter \u2014 addressed to Italian officials including Premier Mario Draghi, members of his Cabinet, the Venice mayor and the Veneto governor.\u201cThis fragile entity, (a) world heritage site, cannot survive without our help,\u201d the letter added.The signatories laid out 10 priorities for the city, including a stop to the passage of huge ships through Venice and a better management of mass tourism, which saw 25 million tourists visit the city in 2019, before the pandemic shut down global tourism.The Italian government in March passed a law aimed at definitively blocking cruise ship traffic through Venice, leaving many with the mistaken impression that the ban was already in effect.JC Viens was arriving at St. Marks\u2019 Square around 6 a.m. for an on-location radio broadcast when he looked up to see an unusual flurry of smaller boats with flashing lights passing through St. Mark\u2019s Basin. The square was nearly empty, except a few tourists snapping photos of the Doge\u2019s Palace as the sun rose behind it.\u25ba Venice bans large cruise ships\u00a0from city center:\u00a0 Move comes two years after canal boat crash\"Then I saw this vessel moving very slowly. It was very surprising. I thought cruise ships were not allowed any more in the canal,\u201d said Viens, a Canadian communications director who became aware of the controversy over the ships while living in Venice for the second half of 2020 when the drop in tourism reduced even everyday canal traffic.Recalling the fall and the new round of virus restrictions, he said \u201cIt was quite eerie to see the city so quiet, and also to experience the Giudecca canal without any such vessels. It was impressive to see the peacefulness.\u201dAfter the virus pause, many Venetians aren\u2019t happy to see cruise ships return for the first time since January 2020. The No Big Ships Committee is planning to see the Costa Orchestra passengers off with a noisy protest on Saturday.The battle over cruise ships in Venice took focus after the Costa Concordia sank off Tuscany in 2012, killing 32 passengers and crew members. After an initial ban on ships over 40,000 tons in Venice, the industry and authorities reached a voluntary agreement allowing vessels with lower sulfur fuel levels to traverse the lagoon.But the underlying point of contention on having cruise ships in the lagoon at all, as both a safety and environmental hazard, still hasn\u2019t been addressed, despite years of studies and proposals.Cruise industry officials say the current government seems the most focused on resolving the issue once and for all.Italy\u2019s Infrastructure and Sustainable Mobility Ministry told The Associated Press that a bidding process would open \u201cany day now\u201d for \u201cideas aimed at identifying better and structural solutions to realize a new docking area for large ships outside of the Venice lagoon.\u201dThe new terminal would be used both for cruise and container ships, the ministry said in an email.\u201cMeanwhile, in 2022, as a temporary solution a certain number of ships will be able to dock in Marghera, easing transit on Venice,\u201d the ministry said.Cruise industry officials have told the AP that Marghera, an industrial port within the Venice lagoon, currently does not have suitable facilities to serve as a passenger terminal. In addition, for it to become even a temporary solution for larger ships, the current docks would have to be extended and a channel would have to be dredged.Jane da Mosto, executive director of the non-governmental organization We Are Here Venice, called on the government to send stronger signals, and return to the 40,000-ton limit.\u201cI can understand it taking time to figure out a solution, but why not just have smaller ships come in?\u201d da Mosto said. \u201cIt is days like today that, as Venetian citizens, we want to hear someone formally recognize that what is happening shouldn\u2019t be happening, and that they are really trying to clear it up.\u201d\u25ba Have COVID vaccine, will travel:\u00a0\u00a0These countries have reopened to fully vaccinated Americans"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/05/20/apple-watch-assistive-touch-gesture-screen/5185338001/", "headline": "Apple Watch's AssistiveTouch lets you use without touching screen", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 2:52 p.m. ET May 20, 2021 Updated: 5:16 p.m. ET May 20, 2021", "text": "Apple Watch users know they can use their device hands-free thanks to voice assistant Siri.

Starting Monday, people will be able to visit Arizona State University's venue for basketball and other events near Rural Road and University Drive to receive a vaccine shot inside, away from the heat.The site currently at\u00a0Phoenix Municipal Stadium located northwest of Arizona State University's Tempe campus has administered nearly 200,000 doses to date. Those who received a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at the stadium and are awaiting a second will be scheduled at the new location, according to the Department of Health Services.Patients will be able to park for free at lots near the arena, which is also accessible by light rail and bus. The lots are No. 58, next to the arena,\u00a0and No. 59, which are both on Packard Drive, between Rio Salado Parkway and East 6th Street.Carts will be available to transport people needing assistance to the arena, AZDHS spokesperson Steve Elliott said.Vaccinations\u00a0will be administered on the arena's main concourse, and arena seating will be available for patient observation following the shot.Thursday's announcement is one of several changes the state has implemented or planned in order to shift mass vaccination efforts indoors. The State Farm Stadium location transitioned to evening operation this week and will move inside\u00a0Gila River Arena on April 23.The state also opened up the Valley's first indoor, drive-thru vaccination site at Dexcom's distribution center in east Mesa,\u00a0near Loop 202\u00a0and Power Road, which replaces the outdoor site at Chandler-Gilbert Community College.

It is one of the largest mass-vaccination sites in the country.\u2014 Nienke Onneweer3:30 p.m. Wednesday: Arizona could still have another COVID-19 surge, ASU expert saysCases of COVID-19 are spiking in Michigan and the New York region, and it's possible another surge could happen in Arizona, a top state health expert said Wednesday.Dr. Joshua LaBaer, who directs Arizona State University's Biodesign Institute, said there's potential for another surge of illness in the state, though it could be counterbalanced if enough people get vaccinated.LaBaer noted that Arizona over the last several days has seen a slight but \"measurable\" rise in new COVID-19 cases, \"so we'll have to keep an eye on that.\"More than 2.4\u00a0million people statewide had received at least one vaccine dose as of Wednesday, with approximately one in five Arizonans fully vaccinated against COVID-19, state data show.\"By May 1, but the end of this month, our modeling team is projecting that more than 1,000 lives will be saved by vaccinations that have currently gone on here,\" LaBaer said. \"Vaccination is clearly having an effect here. It's saving lives without a doubt and will continue to do so as we get more people vaccinated.\"He emphasized that the more transmissible and somewhat more deadly B.1.1.7 variant of the new coronavirus is taking hold in Arizona, which places more urgency on continuing to get people vaccinated. The B.1.1.7 variant was first detected in the U.K., and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday that it's now the most dominant strain in the U.S.\"It now represents almost half of the cases we see routinely here at the Biodesign Institute, in terms of the positive cases we see,\" LaBaer said. \"My guess is, and this is just speculation, that it will outcompete the California variant, which is the other common variant in Arizona, and probably become the predominant variant in Arizona.\"If the level of B.1.1.7 in Arizona continues to increase, it is going to take a higher fraction of Arizonans getting vaccinated to reach what's known as herd immunity, LaBaer said. Herd immunity is the level of the population that is immune to the virus needed to prevent exponential spread through the community.Experts have said it will take 70% or more of the population getting vaccinated to reach herd immunity, when a \"chain reaction\" of new coronavirus transmission between people would be very difficult.The two key factors in preventing another surge of COVID-19\u00a0in Arizona will be continuing with mitigation measures such as\u00a0wearing masks in public\u00a0and continuing to get more people vaccinated, LaBaer said. So far, the available COVID-19 vaccines are proving effective against the B.1.1.7 variant, he said.\"Certainly with the growing dominance of the B.1.1.7 strain here in the state and increased spread throughout the country, there is a chance that we will start to see rising numbers here.\"\u2014 Stephanie Innes3:30 p.m. Wednesday: UFCW Local 99 hosting COVID-19 vaccination clinic for essential workersThe United Food and\u00a0Commercial Workers Union\u00a0Local 99\u00a0announced it is vaccinating members and other essential front-line workers in the grocery, hotel, restaurant\u00a0and manufacturing industries in Maricopa County.\u00a0The Arizona-based labor union said it will be administering about\u00a01,800 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at a private event at the UFCW Local 99 office at 2401 N. Central Ave.\u00a0in Phoenix.\u00a0Dianne Joselit of the UFCW Local 99 told The Arizona Republic that the vaccine will be given out on April 7, 8\u00a0and 9. Those who want to get vaccinated can make an appointment online\u00a0or by calling a union representative.\u2014 Connor Van Ligten1:45 p.m. Wednesday: Close to 40% of Maricopa County residents over 15 have received at least one shotAbout 38% of Maricopa County residents ages 15 and older had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, county data released Wednesday show.More than 1.3 million county residents had gotten at least one dose, and more than 840,000 residents were fully vaccinated.The county has seen success in reaching older demographics, with 77% of residents ages 75 and older vaccinated with at least one dose and 74% of those 65-74 years old. Just over half of residents ages 55-64 have received at least one dose.Younger age groups still have a ways to go, but most only became eligible to begin registering for appointments at the end of March.To date, 32% of those 45-54 had received at least one shot; 28% of those 35-44; 22% of those 25-34; and 14% of those 15-24.Vaccine uptake varies by race. While about 29% of white county residents 15 and older have received at least one shot, just about 20% of Black adult county residents have been vaccinated with at least one dose. About 41% of Asian or Pacific Islander adults have received at least one shot, and 47% of American Indian or Alaska Native adult residents have received at least one shot.About 11% of Hispanic/Latino adult county residents have gotten at least one shot, but ethnicity data is unknown for 54% of all vaccinated individuals.On average, about 30% of all Maricopa County residents had received at least one vaccine dose. Experts say likely 70% or more of the population needs to get vaccinated to reach herd immunity and prevent future outbreaks.\u201cVaccines are an important step towards putting this pandemic behind us,\u201d Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine, medical director for disease control at the county public health department, said in a statement. \u201cThe sooner we get enough of the community vaccinated and reach herd immunity, the sooner we can get back to seeing family and friends the way we normally would.\u201dCounty residents can sign up for vaccine appointments at a range of pharmacies, health clinics and large state-run sites. County officials said they will continue to hold smaller community events targeted at underserved groups, long-term care facilities, group homes, behavioral health homes, domestic violence shelters, individuals experiencing homelessness, homebound individuals, senior housing and frontline essential workers. \u00a0\u2014 Alison Steinbach 9 a.m. Wednesday: Mobile events to serve people with disabilitiesMercy Care and Touchstone Health Services will be sending mobile COVID-19 vaccination teams to Gompers campuses around the Valley as part of the state's effort to improve vaccine accessibility for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.Gompers is a nonprofit agency that offers private school as well as day programs and employment opportunities to people with disabilities.AHCCS, the Arizona Department of Economic Security's Division of Developmental Disabilities and Mercy Care have teamed up to reach out to providers serving people with disabilities as well as other vulnerable populations, according to a Wednesday press release.\u00a0Mercy Care, which has a state contract with DDD, connected Gompers with Touchstone Health Services, which is providing the mobile vaccination team and supplies. The Maricopa County Department of Public Health will provide the supplies, the statement said.The first event will be Wednesday at 9 a.m. at Gompers' Employment Services campus near 51st Avenue and Bethany Home Road in Glendale. The second will take place at 11 a.m. Wednesday at the Phoenix campus near 27th and Glendale avenues.A third mobile vaccination event will happen Friday at 9 a.m. at the Blythe Center campus near 75th and Peoria avenues.The clinics are not open to the public.\u2014 BrieAnna J.

Cleaning with a household cleaner that contains soap or detergent reduces the amount of germs on surfaces and, in most situations, removes most virus particles on surfaces, the guidance says.\u00a0\"Clean high-touch surfaces regularly (for example, daily) and after you have visitors in your home,\" the guidance says. 11 a.m. Tuesday: Gov. Ducey announces efforts to help disability community get vaccinated\u00a0\u00a0Gov. Doug Ducey and the Arizona Department of Health Services on Tuesday announced new efforts to ensure people with disabilities have \"quick, easy\" access to COVID-19 vaccines.The Arizona Republic previously reported that some\u00a0disability advocates were upset by the state expanding eligibility for the vaccine to nearly everyone, before many in the disability community had a chance at getting the shot. Late last week, Ability 360 announced that it would be hosting vaccination events at its Phoenix campus for people with disabilities starting on April 10 and 11.The Tuesday statement from the governor's office said the events were the result of a partnership between the state, Ability 360 and The ARC of Arizona, a disability advocacy organization.It went on to say that ADHS was working with Passport Health to offer the vaccinations and that Special Olympics will provide\u00a0volunteers. The Arizona Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing will provide sign language interpreters.Organizers anticipate\u00a0administering 3,000 doses of the vaccine through the Ability 360 events, with additional events still \"in the planning stages,\" according to the statement.ADHS is partnering with the Arizona Department of Economic Security's Division of Developmental Disabilities to coordinate vaccination for its members, either by registering them for vaccine appointments at state-run sites or by administering vaccines at-home for those who cannot leave. Case managers are directly contacting individuals to discuss vaccination needs and logistics, the statement said.\u2014 BrieAnna Frank 3 p.m. Monday:\u00a0UA students sought for study on if vaccinated spread virus\u00a0Researchers hope to recruit students from the University of Arizona to participate in a clinical trial\u00a0testing whether fully vaccinated people are able to contract and spread COVID-19.The study, called PreventCOVIDU, is enlisting 12,000 students from more than 20 universities across the country for the next four to five months, according to a Monday statement from the University of Arizona Health Sciences.Announced at a White House COVID-19 Response Team briefing on March 26, the\u00a0goal of PreventCOVIDU\u00a0is to determine whether viral transmission is still possible in vaccinated individuals and to provide scientific guidance for post-vaccination public health measures. Dr. Elizabeth Connick, chief of the University of Arizona College of Medicine's Division of Infectious Diseases, is leading the PreventCOVIDU research site at the university in Tucson.\"Right now, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommends that everybody continue to mask and socially distance, and this will tell us if those measures are truly necessary,\u201d Connick said in Monday's release.Students who enroll in the PreventCOVIDU trial will be randomly assigned to either immediately receive a dose of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccination or wait four months for their first shot. According to the statement, each student will get a daily nose swab, regular blood tests and online questionnaires through the end of the study. University of Arizona students will still be required to participate in the existing school testing protocol.Students aged 18 to 26 who have no known history of COVID-19 infection and who have not yet been vaccinated against the virus are eligible.Participants will also identify their close contacts \u2014 people with whom they have regular contact\u00a0\u2014 who will be asked to answer weekly questionnaires and submit to blood tests and would be contacted if the participant tests positive.Results of the study would likely be released later this year, according to the statement.\u00a0\u201cThe goal is to see in a real-world situation, how well does the vaccine work? Does it protect against asymptomatic infection and transmission?\u201d Connick said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made great progress vaccinating people, but we don\u2019t have herd immunity yet. We need to do this study now so we can understand how effective the vaccine is at creating herd immunity.\u201dMore information is available at\u00a0https://preventcovidu.org/.\u2014 Emily Wilder 12 p.m. Monday: Indoor COVID-19 vaccination site to open April 22 at WestWorldGov. Doug Ducey and the Arizona Department of Health Services announced Monday that an indoor COVID-19 vaccination site will open April 22 at WestWorld\u00a0in anticipation of hotter temperatures in the Valley.The new site in Scottsdale will offer 3,000 to 4,000 appointments per day and operate from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., the statement said, adding that the facility has the capability to offer 10,000 appointments per day.\u201cWith its freeway access, proximity to tribal communities, and extensive indoor facilities, WestWorld is an ideal location for expanding the footprint of state-run vaccination sites in the region,\u201d said Department of Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ in the statement.Daily operations including clinical staff and pharmacy services will be led by Cigna, a global health service company, the statement said.\u00a0\u201cWith another new site, Arizona is once again expanding our capacity to provide the COVID-19 vaccine to all Arizonans,\u201d Ducey said\u00a0in the statement.\u00a0\"I encourage all Arizonans to schedule an appointment and get vaccinated as soon as possible. The vaccine is safe, effective, and free of charge.\"\u00a0In Arizona, more than 3.7 million vaccine doses have been administered and more than 1 million of the doses were given at state-run vaccine sites, according to Ducey.\u00a0The city of Scottsdale, Cigna, Department of Health Services and Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs are partners\u00a0in offering\u00a0the vaccine site at the facility, which will be used as a vaccination site through June 30, the statement said.The drive-thru State Farm Stadium vaccine site will operate from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m. starting this week instead of being a 24/7 site, according to the statement.A distribution center in Mesa also opened Monday as the first state-run indoor drive-thru vaccine site, replacing the outdoor site at Chandler-Gilbert Community College, the statement said. An indoor vaccine site at the Yuma Civic Center also became a state-run site on March 29.\u00a0\u2014 Audrey Jensen 10:35\u00a0a.m. Monday:\u00a0Arizona adds 608 new COVID-19 cases, no deathsArizona\u00a0reported 608 new COVID-19 cases and no new known deaths on Monday, as hospitalizations continued to drop and percent positivity remained at 5% last week for the fifth straight week.\u00a0Arizona's seven-day\u00a0case rate per 100,000 people ranked 44th Sunday among all states and territories, after ranking first and second for much of January,\u00a0according to\u00a0the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's\u00a0COVID Data Tracker.The states with a lower case rate over the past seven days were New Mexico,\u00a0Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Kansas, Hawaii, California, Oklahoma and Arkansas. A week ago Arizona ranked 51st among 60 states and territories, but its rank has been creeping up.The state's seven-day average for new reported COVID-19 cases was 631 on Monday, compared to 536 last Monday, per state data. The average had reached as high as 9,800 in January.\u00a0The state's seven-day death rate per 100,000 people\u00a0ranked 28th in the nation as of\u00a0Sunday,\u00a0per the CDC.But the state's overall COVID-19 death and case rates since Jan. 21, 2020, remain\u00a0among the worst in the country.The\u00a0COVID-19 death rate\u00a0in Arizona since the pandemic began is 233\u00a0deaths per 100,000 people as of Sunday,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CDC,\u00a0putting it sixth in the country in a state ranking that separates New York City from New York state.\u00a0Arizona's\u00a0known COVID-19 death count remained at 16,990, as no deaths were reported on Monday. Few new deaths are typically reported on Mondays.A total of 844,910\u00a0COVID-19 cases have been identified across the state.\u00a0February and particularly\u00a0March saw\u00a0relatively lower case reports.Hospitalizations for the disease have been generally dropping for about 12 weeks\u2014 Alison Steinbach 10:30\u00a0a.m. Monday: How local response helped slow deaths on White Mountain Apache nationWhen someone on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation receives a confirmed diagnosis of\u00a0COVID-19, health care workers from the Whiteriver Indian Hospital\u00a0jump into action.They personally visit the individual's home to test other household members, perform health evaluations on\u00a0everyone there\u00a0and trace any other potential contacts at risk for COVID-19\u00a0exposure.Health care workers in the community\u00a0say that could be one reason why, even though the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases among White Mountain Apache tribal members is nearly triple the state's rate, the death rate is much lower and continues to fall.Over 90% of COVID-19 cases in the White Mountain community\u00a0are investigated within 24 hours of testing, according to\u00a0Ryan Close, the director of the Department of Preventative Medicine at the Whiteriver hospital, which is the\u00a0only hospital\u00a0on the 1.67 million-acre reservation.\"I feel like what we did made a huge difference,\" Close said.\u00a0\"We evaluated and admitted people aggressively and early. The tribe deserves an incredible amount of credit for\u00a0mobilizing staff ... to make this response possible, because at some point it would have been very difficult to maintain without their considerable help.\"The quick response may have also helped the tribe turn the tide against rapid community spread of the virus, which scientists say could have been fueled by a single variant found only in the White Mountain tribal communities. The\u00a0variant carried a mutation in the spike protein, which scientist theorize could have made it spread more rapidly than other strains of the virus.\u2014 Amanda Morris"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/04/01/godzilla-vs-kong-concrete-cowboy-what-stream-easter-weekend/7024686002/", "headline": "'Godzilla vs. Kong,' 'Concrete Cowboy': What to stream Easter ...", "source": "USA Today", "date": "Published: 9:00 a.m. ET April 1, 2021 Updated: 4:39 p.m. ET April 1, 2021", "text": "Movie theaters are slowly reopening\u00a0for the summer season, but new\u00a0streaming films are still coming home to entertain you and your family during\u00a0socially distanced times.\u00a0This Easter weekend, two iconic monsters tussle in a much-anticipated epic romp, Idris Elba plays urban cowboy dad to \"Stranger Things\" star Caleb McLaughlin in a Netflix family drama, and Casey Affleck plays a psychiatrist with a dead patient and a creepy saboteur in a psychological thriller.If you're planning to return\u00a0to your local theater, the religious horror film \"The Unholy\" stars\u00a0Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Walking Dead\") as a disgraced Boston journalist hoping to jumpstart his career.\u00a0He\u00a0meets a deaf Massachusetts teenager able to hear and heal the sick after a supposed visit from the Virgin Mary \u2013 but\u00a0terrifying instances\u00a0follow\u00a0her apparent miracles.But if you'd rather stick closer to home, here's a rundown of new movies hitting streaming and on-demand platforms this weekend, for every cinematic taste:\u00a0'Godzilla vs. Kong':The battle you've been waiting for even has 'Die Hard' inspirationIf you could use some good ol' monster-punching fun: 'Godzilla vs. Kong'No movie so far this year knows what it is and owns that fact\u00a0more than this slugfest featuring a couple of ginormous movie legends.

Additionally, he hopes the new jail can be solar-powered and the first net-zero jail in the country.\u00a0The jail and boulevard extension will be financed through a county debt refinancing, funds from the 1A ballot initiative\u00a0in 2016\u00a0and\u00a0revenue\u00a0from the\u00a02019\u00a0marijuana sales tax\u00a0increase\u00a0from 3.5% to 6%.\u00a0An intergovernmental agreement between the county and the city lets the county retain the city\u2019s portion of that increased tax revenue.\u00a0\u00a0Despite the historical price tag of these two projects, Ortiz said the original estimate was closer to $140 million.\u00a0\u201cThe county had to really\u00a0adjust,\u00a0recalibrate, pare down the size of the project to ensure that it could\u00a0be\u00a0not just be\u00a0financed, but financed responsibly.

A person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after getting the second Pfizer or Moderna shot or two weeks after the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.But don't throw away your masks just yet.\u00a0Masks are still required in certain indoor settings, in\u00a0some businesses and\u00a0cities can require them inside city facilities.\u00a0Here are some common questions and answers regarding mask use and other COVID-19 precautions as more Arizonans get vaccinated against COVID-19.\u00a0What are the CDC guidelines on mask use?The CDC says people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can resume most activities without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart.The health agency said people can\u00a0safely exercise outside, attend small gatherings with fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people, dine outdoors with people from multiple households and even attend crowded outdoor events without wearing masks.Fully vaccinated people\u00a0can go without a mask at the salon, while shopping, at the movie theater and church. They can dine indoors or go to a bar or participate in a high-intensity exercise class without a face covering or social distancing, too.\u00a0Should I wear a mask if I'm\u00a0not vaccinated?People who have not been vaccinated or have only received the first Pfizer or Moderna shot should continue to wear masks in crowded outdoor spaces and while indoors to limit exposure, the CDC recommends.\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s leading infectious disease expert, recently told Axios that\u00a0the public did not correctly\u00a0understand the CDC\u2019s latest announcement.\u201cI think people are misinterpreting, thinking that this is a removal of a mask mandate for everyone. It\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an assurance to those who are vaccinated that they can feel safe, be they outdoors or indoors.\u201dWhere are masks still required?That depends on where you live, shop, work or travel.\u00a0Government regulations, business rules or workplace guidance may for the time being require that people regardless of vaccine status to continue wearing masks or social distancing.The CDC guidelines state fully vaccinated people must still wear masks in health care settings. Face coverings should still be used in congregate settings such as prisons and homeless shelters.Masks are required on planes, buses and trains and in transportation hubs such as airports or bus stations regardless of vaccine status, according to a federal mask mandate that was recently extended to September. The order applies to students and drivers on school buses, too.Read the latest:Arizona COVID-19 updatesIf a business still requires a mask, am I required to wear one?Yes. You should head back to your car and grab a mask if a business requires masks to enter the premises.\u00a0The CDC guidelines require shoppers, diners and anyone visiting a private business to observe the business' rules.\u00a0The issue of mask use and enforcement in businesses has sometimes led to confrontations between customers and workers, who have largely been responsible for compliance with public health mandates.\u00a0But the\u00a0idea of having policies related to customer behavior isn't new, Dr. Joshua LaBaer, director of the Arizona State University Biodesign Institute, previously told The Arizona Republic.\u00a0Businesses have long had rules in place requiring customers to wear shoes and shirts and state and local laws ban smoking in restaurants and other public places.\u00a0This is no different, LaBaer said.\u00a0Businesses may ask customers to leave if they refuse to comply with mask rules. Police suggest employees call officers instead of engaging with customers who become aggressive. Businesses can file a complaint with officers who can then cite people for trespassing or disorderly conduct and remove them from the store.\u00a0'Beginning of the end' of pandemic:More vaccines, moderate cases, fewer masksWhat if the business doesn't require masks but the local government does?Similar to business rules, the CDC guidelines state people must follow local, state or federal policies.\u00a0If mask use or social distancing is required by the local government, people should wear masks even if the business they're entering doesn't require them.\u00a0Can I still wear a mask even if it's not required?Bottom line: If you're fully vaccinated and there are no local rules or business rules requiring masks, it's about personal preference.People who have compromised immune systems, who care for elderly relatives or have young children may want to continue wearing masks even after being vaccinated against COVID-19 and that decision is up to each individual.\u00a0Wearing a mask can help further prevent against infection, which is still possible, through rare, in fully vaccinated people.While the CDC does not recommend wearing a face mask to prevent influenza, cases of the flu were down significantly this flu season. So some people may want to wear masks when influenza is in circulation to reduce their odds of contracting it. In Arizona, flu season typically begins in October and peaks between January and March.What if I have a weakened immune\u00a0system?The CDC cautioned that anyone with a weakened immune system or who is taking certain medications may not be fully protected against the virus even after the vaccine and should consult with their health care provider on best practices.\u00a0Will I be asked to prove I'm vaccinated in stores or other indoor spaces?The new CDC recommendations could put cities and businesses in sticky situations as there's no way to tell who is and isn't vaccinated other than asking to see their vaccination cards.The relaxation of mask and social distancing guidelines largely relies on an honor system, which has led some to raise concerns that case rates could increase again if people who aren't fully vaccinated stop wearing masks.Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey in April issued an executive order banning\u00a0\"vaccine passports,\" a paper or\u00a0electronic record of vaccination. He prohibited local and state governments from requiring people provide their vaccination status to enter\u00a0government buildings or receive government services.\u00a0The order doesn't prohibit health care institutions, schools or other agencies that already collect vaccine documentation from continuing to do so.Businesses, except those that contract with the state to provide public services,\u00a0and employers may require people show their vaccination card or otherwise prove that\u00a0they've received the vaccine to enter the premises.\u00a0In Scottsdale:School board meeting ends in uproar over requiring attendees to wear masksDoes Phoenix require masks?The Phoenix City Council on May 19\u00a0dropped its requirement that vaccinated people wear masks in public.Phoenix, and a handful of other Arizona cities and one county, had kept their mask\u00a0rules after Ducey in late March rolled back many remaining pandemic protocols, including cities' and counties' power to enforce local mask mandates except in government facilities.Phoenix's mask rules now\u00a0conform with the latest\u00a0CDC guidelines and will automatically adjust to follow any future recommendations on mask use from the federal agency.That means vaccinated people aren't required to wear masks in most indoor places or outdoors. Masks still are required on public transit, in air travel and in Phoenix's city buildings.Businesses can continue to set and enforce their own policies on mask use.What about other cities?Tempe, Tucson, Flagstaff and Pima County also had kept their rules requiring masks in public places in defiance of the governor's March orders.\u00a0Starting May 21, you will no longer have to wear a mask while in public in Tempe.Mayor Corey Woods rescinded the city's mask mandate that had been in effect since last June, but the city encouraged people who aren't fully vaccinated to continue wearing masks when possible.\u00a0The Tucson City Council\u00a0voted May 17\u00a0to drop its mask rules and the Pima County Board of Supervisors voted May 14 to rescind its mask mandate following the CDC guidelines.Flagstaff is\u00a0consulting with public health officials on how to move forward and the City Council will take up the rules at its May 25 meeting.Some cities may still require visitors to certain city facilities or those who are enrolled in certain programs to wear masks. Tempe, for example, said programs that serve children, seniors or other vulnerable populations will continue to require masks and social distancing.\u00a0Why am I reluctant to take off my mask?\u00a0While the updated guidelines may be welcome\u00a0news and a sign that a return to normalcy is around the corner, many still may be hesitant to take off their masks.Masks served as one of the main forms of protection against COVID-19 and people may feel like stripping them off is a risk.\u00a0People have grown accustomed to social distancing and masks sometimes served as a barrier for unwanted interactions. Breaking away from that could make some feel uneasy.That's OK and adjusting\u00a0could take some time, experts say.\"Behaviors take time to implement and adopt. They also take time to un-adopt,\" Abraar Karan, an internal medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told USA Today.Vaccinated and test positive? What to know Omicron may have peaked, but hospitals still strained These COVID-19 test sites shut down after the owners made millions COVID-19 update: Latest Arizona newsDo I need to get tested if I've been exposed to COVID-19?The CDC's updated guidelines state that fully vaccinated people don't need to get tested after a known exposure unless they experience symptoms.People who live or work in congregate settings, like a correctional or detention facility or a homeless shelter, must get tested after coming into contact with someone who has COVID-19.\u00a0Can I shake hands if I'm vaccinated?\"If you\u2019ve been vaccinated, you don\u2019t have to wear your mask and you can shake hands,\" President Joe Biden said May 13. \"You can even give each other a hug.\u00a0 But if you\u2019ve not been vaccinated, please wear the mask. Please wear the mask.\"It's unclear whether or not handshakes will become the commonplace greetings they were pre-pandemic, particularly because it's not always obvious whether someone has been vaccinated or not.A little more than a year ago, during the early months of the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci told a Wall Street Journal podcast that he didn't think Americans should ever shake hands again.\"Not only would it be good to prevent coronavirus disease, it would probably decrease the incidence of influenza dramatically in this country,\" he said on April 7, 2020. \"I don't think we're ever going to get back to free-flying lack of attention to what transmissibility of infections are. I think people are going to be careful.\"Where do I have to wear masks while traveling?Interim CDC guidance, updated May 13, says travelers are required to wear a mask\u00a0on all planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the U.S. and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations.There are some exceptions to the mask rule on transportation.\u00a0 Among other things, people are not required to wear a mask while eating, drinking\u00a0or taking medication for brief periods of time, or while communicating for brief periods of time with a person who is hearing-impaired when the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication.Republic reporters Stephanie Innes and Alison Steinbach and USA Today contributed to this report.Reach\u00a0reporter Paulina Pineda at paulina.pineda@azcentral.com or\u00a0480-389-9637.

Programming at the Rhode Island Convention Center, used as a field hospital during a peak in the pandemic last winter, will resume this summer.Gov. Dan McKee made those upbeat announcements Thursday during a media briefing that also saw officials raise\u00a0a caution about the possibility that the aggressive COVID-19 variants now accounting for most new cases of coronavirus disease in the state could spark a resurgence later this year if more Rhode Islanders are not vaccinated.During her time at the microphone during a media briefing at the State House, Health Department Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott referenced last autumn, when activities moved indoors and cases spiked.\u201cTo avoid that same pattern, we need to make sure everyone is fully vaccinated and protected,\u201d Alexander-Scott said.\u201cThe work is not yet done,\u201d added Thomas McCarthy, Health Department COVID-19 unit director. Data showing low positivity rates and hospital admissions, two key measures of infection, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the pandemic is over,\u201d McCarthy said.But it has unquestionably eased in Rhode Island, as reflected in McKee\u2019s decision to close The Dunk and a second mass-vaccination site in Middletown by the end of June. The Convention Center field hospital, which opened on Dec. 1, closed on Feb. 24. Operated by Lifespan, the satellite facility admitted 516 patients total with a peak daily census of 42.But the state will not lose all field-hospital capability. Officials on Thursday said the former Citizens Bank complex Sockanosset\u00a0in Cranston that was used as a satellite hospital during the winter will remain in a state of preparedness. Care New England operated the facility. More recently, the complex has provided vaccinations. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to have that location into the winter,\u201d ready for use if needed, McCarthy said, adding \u201cwe\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure we don\u2019t have to.\u201dAs they have now for weeks, officials urged unvaccinated Rhode Islanders to get their shots. With children 12 and older now eligible, McKee said vaccinating more youngsters is key to returning to in-person learning for the start of school in late summer.\u201cOur goal is to have all students in the classroom when school begins,\u201d McKee said, declaring, as he and many others have, that the in-person learning experience is key to a child\u2019s overall well-being.\u201cI can\u2019t stress enough: schools are safe places,\u201d the governor said.Alexander-Scott advised college students who are returning to campuses at the end of the summer to get their first shot no later than July 4, which will leave time for the recommended second and final shot of the Pfizer and Moderna products. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a single-dose inoculation.Several Rhode Island colleges and universities\u00a0\u2013 including the University of Rhode Island, Brown University, Providence College, the New England Institute of Technology, and Roger Williams and Johnson & Wales universities\u00a0\u2013 are requiring that students be vaccinated if they intend to be on campus on the fall.\u00a0McCarthy outlined several initiatives designed to make vaccinations easier, including more pop-up clinics and equipping primary-care and family practices to give shots in their offices. More than 25 already do, he said, and the hope is for many more.He also announced that people who are 50 and older are now eligible to receive the shots in their homes, an incentive\u00a0for people who have difficulties arranging transportation to sites, pharmacies, clinics and other places.To arrange for a home vaccination, visit https://covid.ri.gov/vaccination-oldThe Rhode Island Department of Health on Thursday reported three coronavirus-related deaths and 41 additional cases. There were 11,393 additional negative tests, for a 0.4% positivity rate.The state has reported an average of 34 new cases a day over the last seven days, the lowest average since the very early days of the pandemic, in March 2020.\u00a0Using the latest census estimate of the Rhode Island population, 49.3% of Rhode Islanders have been fully vaccinated, and 57.9% have been at least partially vaccinated.Thursday\u2019s COVID briefing was held in the historic State Room, adjacent to the governor\u2019s office \u2014 and with the podium placed under Gilbert Stuart\u2019s historic painting of George Washington.Two weeks ago, the governor ended the briefing\u2019s long run at Veterans Memorial Auditorium. For the foreseeable future, the briefing will be held every other week.Asked by The Journal if he will soon end the state of emergency issued by former Gov.

At about\u00a011:20 a.m., he walked over to the women's boutique and took off the \"face masks required\" signs on the glass storefront.\"We're moving forward. It's been a long two weeks,\" Seigle joked, referring back to\u00a0drastic public health-related closures and restrictions that most people thought would be over by April 2020, but stretched to 14 months.Dramatically\u00a0fewer coronavirus cases and increasing vaccinations mean it\u2019s safe for the state to remove nearly all restrictions, state health director Dr. Mark Ghaly\u00a0has said. More than 55% of Californians ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated as of Tuesday.Fully vaccinated individuals no longer have to wear masks in most indoor and outdoor settings, according to the California Department of Public Health.\u00a0Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals will be required to wear face coverings outside of their home.\u00a0Restaurants, bars, retail stores, theaters and entertainment centers can go back to their normal operations,\u00a0and social distancing is no longer required for\u00a0attendees, customers and guests.Employees, however,\u00a0will still be required to wear facial coverings regardless of their vaccination status.\u00a0The\u00a0California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board safety board will consider new regulations during its meeting Thursday that would allow most fully vaccinated employees to forgo masks and\u00a0more closely align with California\u2019s mask rules.Though many like Seigle expressed their excitement for the day, a tremendous\u00a0amount of change hasn't taken over downtown Palm Springs.More:\u00a0Anticipation and apathy: Desert businesses split on importance of Tuesday reopeningRiverside County supervisors question California's mask guidance in workplaces'It feels good'Because the state has seen fewer cases,\u00a0Rick Marshall, a visitor from the east Bay Area,\u00a0said Tuesday it \"feels like the right time to open up.\"He felt \"excited\" when he went into a\u00a0downtown shop for the first time without a mask on Tuesday.\"It feels good seeing the hole in people's faces again,\" he said.Though he was walking around without a mask, his children, both under the age of 12 and ineligible to get vaccinated, still had theirs on. He said it was\u00a0\"unfortunate\" that they couldn't fully participate in the joyous occasion Tuesday.Individuals who are exempt from wearing face coverings at all times include: children younger than 2; those with a medical condition, mental health condition\u00a0or disability that prevents them wearing a mask; those\u00a0who are hearing impaired or communicating with a person who is hearing impaired; and those who cannot wear a mask due to safety risks at work,\u00a0according to the California Department of Public Health.Retailer\u00a0British Invasion was another business that took off its face mask policy on Tuesday. Assistant manager Jamie Magbaleta noted customers looked \"happy\" coming into the store Tuesday without\u00a0masks.\u00a0\"Everyone has been waiting for this day,\" she said.\u00a0Seigle said many visitors coming\u00a0from different states were surprised to learn that California still had a mask mandate in place prior to Tuesday. Now the change in state rules will \"hopefully let us return to normal,\" he said,\u00a0\"whatever the new normal is.\"\"Mentally I've been over it for a while. I'm happy it's over,\" Seigle added.Neither Seigle nor another employee in Terra Gallery were wearing a\u00a0face covering\u00a0Tuesday,\u00a0and Seigle\u00a0believes most of his employees won't be wearing masks moving forward, even though employees are required to wear face masks under current California Occupational Safety and Health rules.\u00a0They have all either been vaccinated or had COVID-19 previously, he said, which made them feel safe to go without one.More: What changes in California on June 15Wondering if you should get tested for COVID-19? Here's the new California guidanceSome still won't shed masksSome businesses still had signs requiring face masks on their storefronts, such as Chicos and Coldstone Creamery, and many individuals strolling along South Palm Canyon Drive\u00a0had theirs on.\"We're so used to it at this point,\" said Olga Farfam, a visitor from Ontario. She and her husband, Enrique, are both fully vaccinated.Even though British Invasion is not requiring masks for customers,\u00a0Magbaleta is choosing to keep hers on to protect her young children at home.\"This is a little shop, I have to protect myself,\" she said. \"COVID-19 is not fully gone.\"Even if a state safety board decides fully vaccinated employees can go without masks, Magbaleta said she sees plenty of tourists stop by the retail store, which is why she wants to give herself extra protection.Gaby Velazquez, who had COVID-19\u00a0and was on a ventilator early in the pandemic, wasn't quite ready yet to take off her mask. Her own recovery, as well as the loss of her brother due to COVID-19, serves as a reminder to what can happen if someone gets sick.\"I just want to be responsible,\" she said. \"Sometimes when adults don't want to wear masks, I tell them my story and they listen.\"At Mario's of Palm Springs, her employer, a sign remains out front requiring\u00a0face masks.\u00a0So far on Tuesday, Velazquez said people coming into the women's clothing store were respectful of their rules, but Monday \"was tough\" with many asking if they have to wear masks knowing that changes were coming the next day.There is even a sign at the front register with cartoon character Spongebob Squarepants demonstrating how to properly wear a face mask over one's nose.You still need a mask for some eventsThere are some safety measures that may need to be in place depending on the type of business and event.County spokesperson Brooke Federico said in a press release that \"meetings, receptions and conferences may resume without testing or vaccination requirements,\" but at mega-events\u00a0\u2014\u00a0indoor events with 5,000 or more individuals and\u00a0outdoor events with 10,000 or more individuals\u00a0\u2014 \"testing and vaccination requirements may apply.\"Riverside County Board of Supervisors Chair Karen Spiegel said\u00a0in a prepared statement, \u201cAs we eagerly reopen and more residents return to these long-awaited for activities, let\u2019s savor life and focus on recovery.\u201dRiverside County reported a\u00a0case rate of 1.5 new daily COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents \u2014 compared to last week's 1.6, according to state data released Tuesday.The county's positivity rate is 1.1%\u00a0and its positivity among at-risk populations is 1.2%.\u00a0Last week's positivity rate was 1.2%\u00a0and positivity among at-risk populations was 1.3%.More than 51% of Riverside County residents ages 12 and older are partially or fully vaccinated, and 43%\u00a0are fully vaccinated as of Tuesday.Ema Sasic covers health in the Coachella Valley.

They are of all races, and all political persuasions, from cities and farms, from families poor and rich. No matter what, they gave their lives for the freedoms we all enjoy.In honor of them,\u00a0the federal government created Memorial Day, held on the last Monday of each May. The holiday wasn't made official until 1971, but Americans have been honoring our fallen soldiers since just after the Civil War ended in 1865.More:Here's a look at Memorial Day events in Volusia, FlaglerBack then it was called \"Decoration\u00a0Day,\" when citizens would go to cemeteries and decorate many of the graves of the 620,000 soldiers who died in the war\u00a0between the North and South. According the history.com website, one of the earliest events\u00a0was organized by a group of former slaves in Charleston, South Carolina, shortly after the Confederacy surrendered in 1865.\u00a0Decoration Day evolved into Memorial Day. And now,\u00a0on Monday, communities and citizens in\u00a0Volusia and Flagler counties will gather at various places in our cities to honor our fallen soldiers.My plan on Monday\u00a0is to walk to Rockefeller Gardens in Ormond Beach at 9 a.m. for that city's Memorial Day event. With the COVID-19 pandemic slowly receding as more people are vaccinated, there should be a pretty good audience. Taps will be played and\u00a0speeches will be made. Many of those at the event will be veterans who survived the wars in which they served.\u00a0I never served in the military, and those who know me well would not describe me as wearing patriotism on my sleeve. But\u00a0I hold in high regard those Americans who have fought in wars to protect your freedom and mine. With that in mind, last week I walked over to Ormond Beach's Hillside Cemetery to get a sense of how many people in that cemetery had fought in wars.It was easy to\u00a0identify the graves of war veterans\u00a0because someone had placed small American flags next to the headstones of those who fought. There were dozens and dozens of them.Charles Kelly was born in 1774 and served as a private in the Spanish-American War in the late 1890s, according to his gravestone. He died in 1974, a few months shy of his 100th birthday.\u00a0Sarah Denning also served in the Spanish-American War. She was born in 1869 and died in 1951. Her husband, Abraham Denning, also served in that war, in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. He lived from 1865 to 1946.William J. O'Leary was born in 1889, and served as a private in what was\u00a0known as the Air Service during World War I. He died in 1977 at the age of 88.Okiffe Ewart Thomas served as a colonel in the Army\u00a0in both World War I and World War II. He was born in 1896 and died in 1963.Richard W. Long served as a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II. He was born in 1923 and died in 1994.\u00a0Kenneth Raymond Ash served in the Navy during the Korean War. He lived from 1931 to 1986. On his tombstone it states: \"Music was his life.\"Francis P. Sora was a sergeant 1st class in the Vietnam War. He was born in 1925 and died in 2001.And so on.Memorial Day is rightly focused on those who have died fighting our wars, but it's also an appropriate\u00a0day to honor all veterans, including those who were fortunate enough to survive the wars in which they fought, and who returned from war and\u00a0contributed to our communities. That\u00a0includes all those veterans who are still with us.Among them is my 93-year-old father, Jack Rice.I've written this before, but Jack\u00a0joined the Navy on his 17th birthday in 1944, and within weeks he was on an oil\u00a0tanker in the Pacific Ocean. He was still out there when the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, and the Japanese surrendered in August 1945.Jack came through it all unscathed, then came back to Wisconsin and worked as a plumber until he retired. He and my mom (deceased) raised five children. Now, he is living in a nursing home near my hometown, which has not been easy for him during the pandemic.I won't call my dad on Memorial Day because he's nearly deaf. But I'm sure going to think about him, and all the other veterans, and especially those who died fighting for us.Pat RIce is The News-Journal's editor.

Under the proposal, venues cannot host more than 26 days of public and private events per year; of that, public events would be limited to 12 days per year.For many, that is just sour grapes.The property in\u00a0question has been recognized as a Century Farm. It used to be the home of Leonard's Campground and Marina. The Thibaults bought the property in 2018 with the hope of opening a sibling for Ashton Creek and have been carefully restoring it since.\"My great, great grandfather owned Riverside Farm. I think the venue will be an asset to our county. Dinwiddie doesn't have a lot of venues for events, and it has no winery at all. This is the first winery in the county, and I think it's an asset also for the people,\" said Linda Barker who lives nearby. \"It's a beautiful place that they've been working diligently\u00a0on for two years, and it's going to be beautiful when they get it done.\"The Thibault family took to Facebook to express concerns over the proposal.\u00a0They even created a hashtag, #doawaywith26days, to rally support.\"Like many other businesses in the county, we proudly chose to invest our time and resources here in Dinwiddie planting 12 acres of grapevines and maintaining the 175-acre property was a dream worth pursuing,\" the family said in a post on their Ashton Creek Vineyard Facebook.\u00a0\"Unfortunately, Dinwiddie County is proposing a new Agritourism Code that will only allow venues to host 100 or more people 26 days of the year, This kind of legislation would only be detrimental to the economic development of Dinwiddie County.\"Support for the project came from Tori Celli Abernathy, a former member of the Dinwiddie Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors.\"If you build it, I will come! Good luck!\" Abernathy posted on Facebook in response.\"We have been by there while on the lake. It is certainly a pretty sight to see. The county is playing hardball which I don't feel will fly with the community,\" posted Pam Williams of Dinwiddie. \"As in Virginia Motorsports Park only have events to fill 26 days, makes no sense. Come on Dinwiddie!\"Other residents who live near the proposed development are not so sure they want to see it come, though. One of them, Caryn Yost, said in an email to The Progress-Index that many of her neighbors\u00a0\"have not been made aware of the substantial impact the proposed zoning rule changes could have on their quality of life, health, safety, and overall welfare.\"\u00a0She said since the notice of the public hearing was made, she and others have gone door-to-door in the neighborhood passing out information about the project. Yost claimed the county was turning a deaf ear to their concerns.\"The Board [of Supervisors] leans towards development, which is fine, but without \u00a0defined 'substantial impacts,\u2019\u00a0there are few rights for citizens,\" Yost said, adding Dinwiddie needs to codify a definition of \"substantial impacts\" that must be addressed before any development comes in.Throughout it all, the Thibault family maintained their only concern was about the 26-day limit. Everything else can be worked out.\"The only goal is to prevent the 26-day limitation,\" Alan Thibault said.\u00a0\"We have no problem with the current noise ordinance.

We hope to grow more so that 100% of our grapes used in production come from both of our locations.\"Kristi K.
