Several of them said Murdaugh used money orders given to an unnamed family member to get his hands on the cash, prosecutors said.Murdaugh has been in jail since October for the ever-growing list of breach of trust, forgery, money laundering and computer crime charges. A judge set his bail at $7 million and refused         to reduce it, even as Murdaugh's lawyer argued his         bank accounts were seized in         civil lawsuits and he could barely afford to buy underwear at the Richland County jail. He has blamed his problems on years of         drug addiction.Murdaugh's professional career began to unravel after his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, were killed          in a shooting at the family's home in June. Murdaugh's lawyers have adamantly said he had nothing to do with it and repeatedly said they hope investigators are working as hard to find their killers as they are untangling Alex Murdaugh's finances.Murdaugh is the fourth generation of a prominent legal family in         tiny Hampton County. His great-grandfather, grandfather and father were all elected prosecutors and his family helped run the biggest law firm in the county for a century.Friday's indictments include charges for Murdaugh's handling of the aftermath of a wreck that caused a deaf man to end up quadriplegic.Murdaugh took a $309,000 check he was supposed to give to Hakeem Pinckney's family and instead bought money orders that went to cover money he took from the accounts of other clients, to pay down a loan and get cash for himself and an unnamed family member, according         to the indictment.Then when Pinckney died in a nursing home from the lingering effects of his injuries, Murdaugh got an additional $89,000 settlement on Pinckney's behalf, but deposited that check in his account without ever telling the man's family, prosecutors said.The lawyer for the Pinckney family said the transactions are complex and hard to follow and even more money may have been stolen. Prosecutors have suggested at Murdaugh's bond hearing that they still haven't gotten to the bottom of his shady practices.Pinckney was Black, and most of the people Murdaugh stole from were like him \u2014 minorities and not well off, family attorney Justin Bamberg said.\u201cAlex gave them just enough money so they would drop on their knees and say \u2018thank you, Jesus\u2019 and took the rest,\u201d Bamberg said.Bamberg said Murdaugh\u2019s longtime law firm,         which fired him after learning he was stealing money, his         banker friends and other professionals who Murdaugh used as personal representatives for hurt victims and grieving families or who played other roles in helping his schemes go on so long should face consequences, too, because even if they aren't criminally responsible, they should have asked questions.\u201cWe are coming for your pockets. We're going to get all the money these people were supposed to get,\u201d Bamberg said.Another indictment Friday details how starting in 2013, Murdaugh collected 14 settlement checks totaling more than $1.3 million for a man whose wife died in a wreck and stole all the money for himself.Other victims have included a state trooper, family friends and an immigrant living in the country illegally, according to         previous indictments.At his bond hearings, Murdaugh's lawyers blamed years of addiction to opioids for his behavior, saying he has sought counseling and wants to         make things right for the clients he hurt.Murdaugh's law license has been suspended since his arrest in September after state agents said he tried          to arrange his own death  so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy.\u2014\u2014\u2014This story corrects that Murdaugh now faces 71 charges of financial and other crimes\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at          https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/", "headline": "U.S. News | Latest National News, Videos & Photos - ABC News ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "", "text": "", "error": "Failed to scrape"}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/undefeated-deaf-football-team-brings-triumph-pride-california/story?id=81278053", "headline": "Undefeated: Deaf football team brings triumph and pride to ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "November 20, 2021, 12:59 PM", "text": "Once considered underdogs, the football team at the California School for the Deaf in Riverside has defied the odds with an undefeated season that has electrified and inspired spectators in California and beyond.The Cubs Varsity football team was 11 and 0 this season and now has won the division championship game, which is a first in the school's 68-year history.\"It's inspiring for the deaf community quite honestly. 11 and 0 we've never experienced this being this far in playoffs,\" coach Keith Adams told ABC News. \"The community is so excited, the morale has been uplifted, the self-esteem of our players -- you can see a major difference.\"Amelia Ortiz/CSDR Student Yearbook CommitteePlayers from the Cubs Varsity football team at the California School for the Deaf in Riverside are seen during one of their games in 2021.Wide receiver Jory Valencia told ABC News that the notion that they've never had a successful season only \"fired us up\" and inspired them to push harder each game.\"Now we're just destroying every game.

Smith delivered the same words to the world in American Sign Language.Smith is a student at the prestigious Gallaudet University, an international school for the Deaf based in Washington, D.C.\u201cThat speech inspired me as a Black deaf man living in this world, knowing that opportunities may not be granted to me,\u201d Smith told ABC News\u2019 Kyra Phillips. \u201cEvery day I knew that I had to work three or four times harder to really get those opportunities that I wanted.\u201dThis college junior, who has achieved so much already, has also become a part of a movement to celebrate and preserve a language born out of oppression and segregation.ABCSmith is a football star and Black student union leader.Smith said Black American Sign Language, or BASL, is vital to preserve \u201cbecause it\u2019s our language. It's our gestures, it's our vibes. It's how we communicate, how we are able to talk.\u201dAfter the police-involved killings of George Floyd and other unarmed Black people last year, people of all races across the country took to the streets to demand recognition of Black people and perspectives.Amid the reckoning, young Black Signers went to social media to highlight the history of a language that had been suppressed for decades.The first American School for the Deaf opened in 1817, but Black children were not allowed to attend. They had to create their own schools and their own way of communication.Carolyn McCaskill, a professor at Gallaudet, only had one option as a deaf 5-year-old in the 1960s -- the Alabama School for the Negro Deaf and Blind.Carolyn McCaskillCarolyn McCaskill, Ph.D, a professor at Galluadet, only had one option to learn to communicate as a 5-year-old in the 1960s-- the Alabama School for the Negro Deaf and Blind.When she learned BASL, \u201cI did get that sense of freedom from being able to incorporate who I was and how I wanted to communicate,\u201d she said.That freedom forged another challenge -- integration. Black and white Deaf students were finally sharing classrooms, but not a common language. Black American Sign Language is different from American Sign Language. In order to survive, McCaskill had to learn \u201cthe white way.\u201d\u201cWhite is right -- that's what I thought, that was what was prevalent,\u201d she said. \u201cI learned how to sign that way, and I actually put to the side the way I knew how to communicate, to sign. And my Black friends would say, 'You're signing different, Carolyn! You're signing like you're white.' And I remember not liking that. I wanted to keep my way, my Black way of communicating.\u201dABCA life, language and labor of love are all part of McCaskill\u2019s new book \u201cThe Hidden Treasure of Black ASL\u201d and of her new role as founding director of Gallaudet\u2019s first-ever Center for Black Deaf Studies.And she did. Voted \u201dMost Ambitious\u201d by her classmates, the honor student conquered communication through code switching, or adjusting one's style of speech and expression based on the group.\u201cSo when I was with white people, I would sign that way. And then when I was with Black Deaf people, I would communicate it differently,\u201d McCaskill said, adding BASL \u201cfelt so free to me. It felt good to just communicate. You know, that was who I was. That was my culture. That was my identity.\u201dLife, language and labor of love are all part of McCaskill\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Hidden Treasure of Black ASL.\u201d She's also the founding director of Gallaudet\u2019s first-ever Center for Black Deaf Studies.McCaskill even demonstrated a few differences between the sign languages, such as phrases like \u201cstop playing\u201d in ASL would be \u201cstop tripping\u201d in BASL.Smith, her protege, football star and Black student union leader, showed some of his own favorite signs.

An appellate court also declined to reinstate the award.D'Onofrio had worked for Costco for 24 years, and said she never had issues communicating with managers until one arrived who mumbled, the South Florida SunSentinel         reported.She requested an interpreter or to have communications written down for her. Instead, Costco provided her with a video phone with online interpretation services. Managers then wrote her up for yelling too loudly into the phone. She sent a letter to the company\u2019s CEO complaining about her treatment. Shortly after, she was suspended for a week, then terminated in October 2013, the lawsuit said.Jurors in the Fort Lauderdale trial agreed with D'Onofrio's claim that Costco didn't provide a reasonable accommodation as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, but decided she wasn't terminated because of her disability and in retaliation for her complaints.Jurors awarded her $750,000 for mental anguish and $25,000 in punitive damages, the newspaper reported.U.S. District Judge William Zloch overturned the verdict, finding that \u201cno reasonable jury could have found in favor of (the) plaintiff.\u201d Zloch ruled that D\u2019Onofrio had rejected the video phone and online interpretation services provided by Costco.D\u2019Onofrio's lawyers appealed, arguing that the phone and online services did not overcome communication problems that arose during her final year at Costco, the newspaper reported.The company argued that it went beyond its legal responsibilities in providing the interpretive services and equipment to D\u2019Onofrio.In January 2019, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 decision found that Costco did provide reasonable accommodation to D\u2019Onofrio and declined to overturn Zloch\u2019s ruling, the newspaper reported.The petition to the Supreme Court asked justices to consider whether the appellate court failed to apply the correct standard of review.

Her lawyers say she\u2019s a scapegoat for Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial behind bars.Here are snapshots from a trial drawing international attention:END OF INNOCENCEThe         first Maxwell accuser\u2019s story began innocently enough: She was a 14-year-old eating ice cream at a music camp in 1994 when she was approached by Epstein and Maxwell, walking her Yorkie. What followed over the next few years, the accuser said, scarred her for life.The witness \u2014 a woman now in her early 40s who was introduced to jurors as \u201cJane\u201d to protect her privacy \u2014 testified that Maxwell and Epstein groomed her by taking her shopping and inviting her and her mother to Epstein\u2019s mansion in Palm Beach, Florida.Soon she was visiting the home by herself when, she said, Maxwell and Epstein lured her into unwanted sexual contact that Maxwell treated as \u201cno big deal.\" It was a pattern prosecutors hope to prove was repeated over and over with other girls and young women.On Friday,          the prosecution unfolded a green massage table from the Epstein home to corroborate the accuser's testimony that massages were used as pretense for the sexual encounters.The defense demanded to know why \u201cJane\u201d had taken so long to come forward.\u201cI was scared,\u201d she said, choking back tears. \"I was embarrassed, ashamed. I didn\u2019t want anybody to know any of this about me.\u201dDEAF, DUMB AND BLINDProsecutors say         Maxwell created \u201ca culture of silence\u201d to shroud her and Epstein's crimes. And a piece of evidence seemed to put that culture in writing.Those instructions were part of a 58-page booklet with rules for staff working at the mansion. As if to drive home the point about keeping Maxwell and Epstein\u2019s secrets, prosecutors say Epstein ordered the construction of a detached staff quarters surrounded by a tall wall that prevented any view of the main house.Juan Alessi, a former estate manager, testified he considered the privacy measure \u201ca kind of warning that I was supposed to be blind, deaf and dumb, to say nothing of their lives.\u201dAlessi recalled seeing \u201cJane\u201d several times at the residence and noticed she looked underage. But he also said he never saw her enter the master bedroom with Epstein \u2014 or noticed anything else suspicious about her and the revolving door of young women that would have indicated sex crimes were occurring in his workplace.He claimed no one alerted him to any misconduct.\u201cI wish they would have because I would have done something,\u201d he said.DEFENSE ON THE ATTACKThe defense displayed         some of the tactics it plans to use to discredit \u201cJane\u201d  and three other key accusers who are slated to testify before the end of the month.Maxwell\u2019s lawyers are seeking to portray their accounts of abuse as unreliable, suggesting they have faulty memories and are being manipulated by lawyers encouraging them to play up Maxwell\u2019s role in civil claims after Epstein died. One of the lawyers went so far as to infer that \u201cJane\u201d \u2014 a veteran television actor \u2014 could be using her acting skills to embellish her testimony.The lawyer ran down some of the plot lines \u201cJane\u201d has tackled over the years: protective mom, victim of bullying, someone stalked by serial killers, prostitute. \u201cNot my favorite role,\u201d the witness said of the last.When asked whether her background made her adept giving a \u201cmelodramatic and sentimental treatment of interpersonal situations,\u201d she demurred.\u201cHopefully, not melodramatic,\u201d she said. \u201cJust dramatic.\u201dUP NEXTThree more main accusers are waiting in the wings to testify against Maxwell. When that will happen remains unclear, with prosecutors staying tight-lipped about the order of their witnesses.But the defense\u2019s opening statement gave hints about the accusers up next.A Maxwell lawyer said one is a psychotherapist who met Epstein in New York City when she was 16 and later visited his ranch in New Mexico. Another is a former model from Britain who once dated one of Maxwell\u2019s friends. The third is someone the defense claims introduced Epstein to other victims who are not in the case.Other evidence the prosecution still plans to introduce: flight logs of Epstein\u2019s private planes \u2014 prosecutors say they confirm that Maxwell, Epstein and alleged victims traveled together \u2014 and FedEx records confirming that Epstein sent a gift to one victim when she was just 15 years old.It's projected the trial could last another five weeks.\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz and Larry Neumeister contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-officer-dies-covid-19-months-retirement/story?id=77167746", "headline": "Police officer dies from COVID-19 just 3 months after retirement ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "May 1, 2021, 10:00 AM", "text": "COVID-19 has taken the lives of more than 575,000 Americans and counting.Those we've lost come from all backgrounds and include the very people -- first responders and medical staff -- who have been working on the front lines.

Gary Hart and Warren Rudman. The report was releasedlate Thursday.The report comes a week after CIA Director George Tenet warnedthat Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network is likely to strike againstthe United States sometime soon and that the current situation issimilar to what existed before the Sept. 11 attacks. Tenetpreviously said a terrorist attack would be more likely if theUnited States takes military action against Iraq.Because a year has passed without a major terrorist attackagainst the United States, the report says, \"there are alreadysigns that Americans are lapsing back into complacency.\"Few of the ships, trucks and trains that enter the United Stateseach day are searched, the report said. Emergency personnel areunprepared for chemical or biological attacks. Oil refineries andenergy distribution lines could be sabotaged. State and localpolice still lack access to State Department terrorist watch lists.\"When it comes to combating terrorism, the police officers onthe beat are effectively operating deaf, dumb and blind,\" it said.Rudman and Hart had led a previous commission whose warnings inJanuary 2001 of the likelihood of catastrophic terrorist attacksseemed prophetic eight months later. That commission, created byCongress, said the threat of international terrorism was growingand recommended creating a domestic security agency.President George W. Bush created a Homeland Security officeshortly after the Sept. 11 attacks and has proposed creating a fullCabinet department, but Congress has not yet approved it.Hart and Rudman's latest panel was formed by the Council onForeign Relations. Its 17 members included former Secretaries ofState Warren Christopher and George Shultz, former FBI and CIADirector William H. Webster and retired Adm. William J. Crowe,former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The Office of Homeland Security is reviewing the council'sreport, said spokesman Gordon Johndroe. He said many of itssuggestions are similar to what Bush has proposed.Among the panel's recommendations:Establish 24-hour operations centers in all states to provideterror watch list information.Provide federal funds to clear the backlog of state and localgovernment requests for protective gear, training andcommunications equipment.Strengthen security for sea and land transportation.Evaluate areas of vulnerability for energy supplies and developa stockpile of backup components so energy operations could berestored if damaged.Strengthen health agencies' ability to detect diseaseoutbreaks.\u2014 The Associated PressFBI Warns of Bridge, Train ThreatW A S H I N G T O N, Oct. 25 \u2014 The FBI issued a warning to state and local law enforcement nationwide Thursday about a possible attack soon against transportation systems, particularly railroads.Officials said the warning, based on information obtained from al Qaeda prisoners, suggested that terrorists may try to take out bridges, key sections of tracks or train engines in an effort to cause derailments and widespread damage.\"Information from debriefings of al Qaeda detainees as of mid-October indicates that the group has considered directly targeting U.S. passenger trains, possibly using operatives who have a Western appearance,\" the FBI said in a statement.Intelligence officials continue to believe that al Qaeda plans to attack targets that would be readily recognized as representing U.S. economic interests, the FBI said.Captured al Qaeda photographs of U.S. railroad engines, cars and crossings have increased concern about the threat, the FBI said.Amtrak President David Gunn said federal transportation officials notified him about the warning. \"The threat, like a lot of others, is not specific,\" Gunn said. \"It's not targeted at anything per se.\"Gunn said the passenger railroad is taking steps to enhance security and passenger safety, but declined to describe them except to say they will not be evident to riders.Amtrak has increased patrols and freight railroads have tightened security, the FBI said.Around the Sept. 11 anniversary, Amtrak announced it intended to enforce tighter identification requirements, including random ID checks of passengers on trains. But Amtrak decided to reconsider that plan and has never implemented it.The Office of Homeland Security was contacting key state and local officials to urge their help and vigilance in warding off any such attack, spokesman Gordon Johndroe said.\"The American people should still ride our nation's rails and know that this warning has been provided to state and local law enforcement, and the appropriate security officials, so they can take the appropriate steps to increase protective measures,\" Johndroe said.New York Gov. George Pataki said, \"There are threats and those out there who are looking to do us harm here in the United States.\"He said Ridge did not identify any specific target in New York. Even so, Pataki said, New York has \"put out an advisory across the state to make sure that the public is vigilant and we are vigilant in protecting public services and infrastructure points across this state.\"Separately, U.S. intelligence has learned that al Qaeda supporters may be planning strikes on ships in the Persian Gulf and nearby seas, said one official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\"Such attacks may be a part of more extensive operations against port facilities and other energy-related targets including oil facilities and nuclear power plants,\" the FBI said.The threats are to military vessels and commercial shipping, the official said. Terrorists believed linked to al Qaeda attacked an oil tanker off the coast of Yemen earlier this month.Johndroe said the Homeland Security office is coordinating an interagency effort to increase protection of possible targets.\u2014 The Associated PressDefense Department Probes Iraq-Al Qaeda LinkW A S H I N G T O N, Oct. 24 \u2014  A high-level Defense Department team issifting through intelligence information, looking for links betweenIraq and the al Qaeda terror network, Pentagon officials saidThursday.The team, created in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,is using powerful computers and other methods to analyzeinformation about Iraq gathered by the CIA, the DefenseIntelligence Agency and other spy agencies, the officials said,speaking on condition of anonymity.Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld ordered the team to searchfor information which may have been overlooked that could help showIraqi leader Saddam Hussein's intentions and his links toterrorism, one senior defense official said.Another defense official said the group's function is to providea \"gut check\" on various intelligence analyses.\"These folks can play devil's advocate. They can make the CIAsupport its findings,\" the second official said.Rumsfeld and other top Pentagon policy makers have taken adarker view of Saddam than that taken by the CIA and otherintelligence officials.A CIA report to Congress, for example, concluded that Saddam wasunlikely to use his chemical or biological weapons or give them toterrorists unless Iraq is attacked. Rumsfeld, on the other hand,has repeatedly argued that Saddam cannot be trusted to use anyrestraint, noting his invasions of Iran and Kuwait and use ofchemical weapons on Iraqi citizens.Officials aligned with Rumsfeld say the Pentagon analysis teamis not meant to second-guess the CIA or come to a preordainedconclusion.The New York Times, which first reported on the team,quoted Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz as saying the teammight \"see certain facts that others won't.\"\"The lens through which you're looking for facts affects whatyou look for,\" he told the Times, adding that supporting anyparticular opinion \"should not permit you to create facts or denyfacts.\"Rumsfeld has repeatedly denied persistent news reports oftension between the Defense Department and the CIA \u2014 as well asbetween Rumsfeld and George Tenet, the director of centralintelligence.Tenet oversees both the CIA and Defense Department intelligenceagencies, while Rumsfeld makes budget recommendations for the 80percent of intelligence spending that goes to the defense agencies.\u2014 The Associated PressFederal Screeners Fired for Security Breach at O'Hare AirportC H I C A G O, Oct. 25 \u2014 Two federal security screeners were fired forturning their backs on their posts before a man entered an O'HareInternational Airport terminal without going through security,according to the Transportation Security Administration.The man was seen on surveillance tape entering through thecheckpoint's exit, and officials said an investigation found ittook security agents six minutes to call police and shut down theterminal Oct. 15.

There he was embraced by tearful staff and former juvenile lifers who were freed as a result of the court case that bears Montgomery's name.\u201cIt feels so wonderful,\" said Montgomery during an interview with The Associated Press. When asked what he plans to do now that he is out of prison, Montgomery said he wanted to pay his respects to his mother and grandmother and other family members who died when he was behind bars.Montgomery had been convicted in the 1963 killing  of East Baton Rouge sheriff\u2019s deputy Charles Hurt, who caught him skipping school. Montgomery was 17 at the time. He was initially sentenced to death but the state\u2019s Supreme Court threw out his conviction in 1966, saying he didn\u2019t get a fair trial. The case was retried, Montgomery convicted again but this time sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He served decades at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.A three-member board voted unanimously in favor of parole. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting was held on Zoom with Montgomery appearing on camera at Angola.\u201cHe\u2019s been in prison for 57 years. He has an excellent ... disciplinary record. He is a low risk by our assessment. He\u2019s got good comments from the warden,\" said board member Tony Marabella as he voted to approve Montgomery's release with certain conditions including a curfew and that he have no contact with the victim's family.Montgomery's release owes back to two specific Supreme Court cases. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama that mandatory sentencing of life without parole for juvenile offenders was \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment. But it didn\u2019t settle the question of whether that decision applied retroactively or only to cases going forward.In 2016, the Supreme Court settled the matter when it took up Montgomery\u2019s case and extended their decision on such sentences to people already in prison.The decision ushered in a wave of new sentences and releases. Since the court\u2019s Montgomery decision, about 800 people who had been sentenced to life without parole as juveniles have been released, according to the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth. But, until Wednesday, Montgomery remained in prison.After the Supreme Court decision, he was resentenced in 2017 to life with parole and the state judge who resentenced Montgomery called him a \u201cmodel prisoner\u201d who appears to be rehabilitated. But then the parole board rejected his application two times, the most recent rejection coming in 2019.Andrew Hundley is a former juvenile lifer who was released due to the Montgomery decision and went on to found the Parole Project in 2016 to assist people who have served long prison sentences reenter society. He said many former juvenile lifers who were released and were able to go on with their lives felt a collective sense of guilt that Montgomery \u2014 whose case made their releases possible \u2014 was still behind bars. For juvenile lifers still incarcerated, his release carries a different message, Hundley said.\u201cFor individuals who continue to be in prison, Henry gives them hope that they may be judged by who they are today and not the worst mistake they ever made,\" Hundley said.The Parole Project will help Montgomery with housing, signing up for health care or medications, getting an ID card and learning how to navigate society. The reentry started with a cheeseburger, fries and an orange soda \u2014 his first meal out of prison \u2014 and his first cellphone which staff members said they would help him set up.Montgomery also noted the huge changes that had taken place in Baton Rouge since he was incarcerated \u2014 freeways that didn't exist decades ago, for example \u2014 and said he didn't even recognize some places.Shon Williams was on hand Wednesday to welcome Montgomery. He was a former juvenile lifer who served time in Angola with Montgomery. He recalled Montgomery taking a sign language class in prison that Williams taught despite his arthritis and Montgomery giving him advice in prison to \u201cnever give up.\" Williams said he was holding back tears watching Montgomery on Wednesday.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for him I\u2019d still be in Angola,\" Williams said.During the hearing, Hundley and others spoke of what Montgomery had accomplished in prison including his years of work at the prison's silk screen shop and the length of his stay. He was also instrumental in establishing a boxing team.His release was not without opposition. Hurt, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who Montgomery killed, was married and had three children. Two of his daughters have met with Montgomery in prison and forgiven him, but family members have opposed his release. A prosecutor from the area where Montgomery's crime occurred spoke against his parole as did one of the deputy's daughters, Linda Hurt Woods.\u201cI do not believe that he should be released at this time,\" said Woods, saying that the decision shows deep disrespect to law enforcement officers. \u201cHe made a decision at 17 years old. You know right from wrong at 17. I did.\u201dMontgomery himself said little during the roughly half-hour hearing. He is extremely hard of hearing, and his lawyer often had to repeat questions from the board members. At times Montgomery said he was struggling to find words to express himself.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry that I, that this happened,\" Montgomery said. \u201cI am going to have to live with this all my life, the rest of my life.\u201d Speaking later to the AP he said: \u201cI destroyed my life, they life and the people that I hurt,\" referring to his own family and that of the slain deputy's.\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow Santana on Twitter @ruskygal."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ghislaine-maxwell-jury-work-years-verdict-81986882", "headline": "Ghislaine Maxwell convicted in Epstein sex abuse case - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "December 30, 2021, 5:34 AM", "text": "NEW YORK -- The         British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted Wednesday of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by the American millionaire Jeffrey Epstein.The verdict capped a monthlong trial featuring sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14, told          by four women who described being abused as teens  in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein\u2019s palatial homes in Florida, New York and New Mexico.Jurors deliberated for five full days before finding Maxwell guilty of five of six counts. With the maximum prison terms for each charge ranging from five to 40 years in prison, Maxwell faces the likelihood of years behind bars \u2014 an outcome long sought by women who spent years fighting in civil courts to hold her accountable for her role in recruiting and grooming Epstein\u2019s teenage victims and sometimes joining in the sexual abuse.As the verdict was read, Maxwell was largely stoic behind a black mask.

Even those with great power and privilege will be held accountable when they sexually abuse and exploit the young.\u201dU.S. Attorney Damian Williams praised the victims who testified against Maxwell after experiencing what he called \u201cone of the worst crimes imaginable.\u201d\u201cI want to commend the bravery of the girls \u2013 now grown women \u2013 who stepped out of the shadows and into the courtroom. Their courage and willingness to face their abuser made this case, and today\u2019s result, possible,\u201d he said in a statement.No sentencing date was set.The defense had insisted Maxwell was a victim of a vindictive prosecution devised to deliver justice to women deprived of their main villain when Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial in 2019.Her brother, Kevin Maxwell, said the family believes she will be vindicated on appeal. \u201cWe firmly believe in our sister's innocence,\u201d he said in a written statement.During the trial, prosecutors called 24 witnesses to give jurors a picture of life inside Epstein\u2019s homes \u2014 a subject of public fascination and speculation ever since his 2006 arrest in Florida in a child sex case.A housekeeper testified he was         expected to be \u201cblind, deaf and dumb\u201d about the private lives of Epstein, a financier who cultivated friendships with influential politicians and business tycoons, and Maxwell, who had led a jet-setting lifestyle as the favorite child         of a media mogul.Pilots took the witness stand and dropped the names of luminaries \u2014 Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump \u2014 who flew on Epstein\u2019s private jets.Jurors saw physical evidence like         a folding massage table once used by Epstein and a \u201cblack book\u201d that listed contact information for some of the victims under the heading \u201cmassages.\u201dThere were bank records showing he had transferred $30.7 million to Maxwell, his longtime companion \u2014 onetime girlfriend, later employee.But the core of the prosecution was the testimony of four women who said they were victimized by Maxwell and Epstein at tender ages.Three testified using first names or pseudonyms to protect their privacy: Jane, a television actress; Kate, a former model from Great Britain; and Carolyn, now a mom recovering from drug addiction. The fourth was Farmer, who chose to use her real name after being vocal about her allegations in recent years.They echoed one another in their descriptions of Maxwell\u2019s behavior: She used charm and gifts to gain their trust, taking an interest in their adolescent challenges and giving them assurances that Epstein could use his wealth and connections to fulfill their dreams.They said the script would darken when Maxwell coaxed them into giving massages to Epstein that turned sexual, encounters she played off as normal: After one sexual massage,         Kate, then 17, said Maxwell asked her if she\u2019d had fun and told her: \u201cYou are such a good girl.\u201dCarolyn         testified that she was one of several underprivileged teens who lived near Epstein\u2019s Florida home in the early 2000s and took up an offer to give massages in exchange for $100 bills, which prosecutors described as \u201ca pyramid of abuse.\u201dMaxwell made all the arrangements, Carolyn told the jury, even though she knew the girl was only 14 at the time.Jane said in 1994,         when she was only 14, she was instructed to follow Epstein into a pool house at the Palm Beach estate, where he masturbated on her.Two charges, including the lone count on which Maxwell was acquitted, applied only to Jane.\u201cI was frozen in fear,\u201d she told the jury, adding that the assault was the first time she had ever seen a penis. She also directly accused Maxwell of participating in her abuse.Maxwell\u2019s lawyer asked Jane why it had taken so long to come forward.\u201cI was scared,\u201d she said, choking back tears. \u201cI was embarrassed, ashamed. I didn\u2019t want anybody to know any of this about me.\u201dThe last to testify, Farmer described how Maxwell touched her breasts while giving her a massage at Epstein\u2019s New Mexico ranch and how Epstein unexpectedly crawled into bed and pressed himself against her.Maxwell,         who turned 60 on Christmas,  vehemently denied the charges through her lawyers.Still,         she declined to take the risk of testifying,  telling the judge: \u201cThe government has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt so there is no reason for me to testify.\u201d\u201cThe charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things that Jeffrey Epstein did,\u201d one of Maxwell\u2019s lawyers, Bobbi Sternheim, emphasized to the jury. \u201cBut she is not Jeffrey Epstein and she is not like Jeffrey Epstein.\u201dMaxwell\u2019s legal team questioned whether the accusers\u2019 memories were faulty, or had been influenced by lawyers seeking big payouts from Maxwell and from Epstein\u2019s estate in civil court. During their two-day presentation, they         called as a witness Elizabeth Loftus, a professor who has testified as a memory expert for defense lawyers at about 300 trials, including the rape trial of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.Maxwell\u2019s family complained she was under duress from harsh conditions at the Brooklyn jail where she\u2019s been held since her arrest in July 2020. She had repeatedly, and futilely, sought bail, arguing that she was unable to adequately contribute to her defense.Before Maxwell was taken from the courtroom, Sternheim asked that arrangements be made to give her a coronavirus booster shot, saying infection rates were rising dramatically at the lockup. The recent surge threatened to derail the trial itself as U.S. District Court Judge Alison J. Nathan         prodded jurors to work quickly to avoid the potential of a mistrial caused by sickened jurors.The legal fights involving Epstein and Maxwell are not over.Maxwell          still awaits trial  on two counts of perjury.Lawsuits loom, including one in which a woman not involved in the trial, Virginia Giuffre, says she was coerced into sexual encounters with Prince Andrew when she was 17. Andrew has denied her account and that lawsuit is not expected to come to trial for many months.Following the Maxwell verdict, Giuffre released a statement through her lawyers, saying, \u201cI hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014AP journalist Ted Shaffrey in New York contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/maxwell-jurors-hear-expert-testimony-sexual-predators-81520659", "headline": "Ex-Epstein staffer testifies teen accusers visited mansion - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "December 3, 2021, 1:29 AM", "text": "NEW YORK -- A former housekeeper testified Thursday that two women who have accused Jeffrey Epstein of sexually abusing them as teens were repeated visitors to his Palm Beach mansion, summoned by Epstein or his associate Ghislaine Maxwell.Taking the stand at Maxwell's sex trafficking trial, Juan Patricio Alessi said that one of her accusers,         who testified under the pseudonym \u201cJane\u201d earlier this week, initially visited the house with her mother and later returned several times alone. She went to the movies and took a plane trip with Epstein, Maxwell and their guests, Alessi said.He said another of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, visited \u201cvery often\" after encountering Maxwell at former President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club. Alessi said he was chauffeuring Maxwell when she had him stop the car so she could pop out and talk to Giuffre, who was working as a spa attendant.Alessi said he sometimes picked up Giuffre or \u201cJane\u201d from their homes, on instructions from Maxwell or Epstein, and would bring the visitors to Maxwell at her desk.After that, it was \u201cnot my job to see where they were,\u201d he said.One time, Giuffre brought her boyfriend into the house with her, he said, and Maxwell said the man needed to leave and wait in the car.Alessi said he saw also \u201cmany, many, many\u201d young adult female visitors, often lounging topless by the pool, who appeared to be in their late 20s.He worked at Epstein's sprawling home from 1990 to 2002 \u2014 and admits he returned two years later to steal $6,300 in cash from Epstein's desk. He said Epstein confronted him about the theft and agreed not to press charges if Alessi repaid him, which Alessi said he did.Epstein killed himself in jail in 2019, while charged with sex trafficking counts that alleged he abused dozens of underage girls in New York and Florida. The          case against Maxwell  stems from four now-adult women who said she helped him victimize them.Giuffre's allegations, which include claims that Epstein and Maxwell         trafficked her at age 17 and 18 to other prominent men who have denied it, are not part of the case.Maxwell, 59, denies the allegations against her, and her lawyers say prosecutors are going after her because they can\u2019t try Epstein.The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they decide to tell their stories publicly, as Giuffre has done.Maxwell, a British socialite, was Epstein\u2019s onetime girlfriend         and, later, employee. Prosecutors said she took the girls on shopping trips and movie outings, talked to them about their lives and encouraged them to accept financial help from him.The government also says she also helped to create a sexualized atmosphere by talking with the girls about sex and encouraging them to give Epstein massages, and the woman identified as \u201cJane\u201d         testified this week  that she had sexual interactions with Epstein at age 14 with Maxwell in the room and sometimes participating. Maxwell\u2019s lawyers         pointed to FBI documents that said the woman gave the government a different account in 2019; she questioned the documents' accuracy.Alessi portrayed an imperious Maxwell letting it be known that she was \u201cthe lady of the house\u201d and handing out a 58-page booklet with rules for staff on everything from how to address her and Epstein to what types of notepads to put on their desks.\u201cChecklists will assist you in making sure every task has been completed and not even the smallest detail has been overlooked,\u201d the book said, instructing employees to \u201ctry to anticipate\u201d Epstein and Maxwell's needs and to \u201csee nothing, hear nothing, say nothing\u201d except when spoken to.\u201cI was supposed to be blind, deaf and dumb and say nothing of their lives,\" Alessi said.Staffers had to \u201crun the house like a five-star hotel,\u201d keep Epstein\u2019s cars washed and stocked with $100 bills in them for his weekend visits and avoid looking him in the eye. Maxwell said he didn\u2019t like such eye contact, according to Alessi, who said she and Epstein called him \u201cJohn\u201d instead of \u201cJuan.\u201dEarlier Thursday, psychologist Lisa Rocchio testified that child sexual abusers often groom their victims in a progression that includes giving presents, building a sense of trust and gradually introducing more sexually charged talk and touching.Before the trial, Maxwell's lawyers tried unsuccessfully to block Rocchio's testimony, saying it didn't have enough scientific grounding.After she took the stand, defense lawyer Jeffrey Pagliuca suggested that some things she described as grooming \u2014 such as giving gifts, taking children to special places or paying them attention \u2014 could also be innocuous.He recalled, for example, his grandfather taking him to the Bronx Zoo as a child.\u201cI'm assuming he wasn\u2019t taking you there for sexual abuse,\u201d she retorted, saying that simple kindness isn't grooming \u201cin the context of a healthy and normal relationship.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/inmate-key-juvenile-life-debate-parole-81196883", "headline": "Inmate who was key to juvenile life debate is up for parole - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "November 16, 2021, 6:09 AM", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- In recent years, hundreds of people once destined to spend the rest of their lives in prison after being convicted of crimes as juveniles have gone free after Supreme Court decisions ruling that young people are capable of change and should be given a second chance.But so far the man whose case has been central to this change \u2014 75-year-old Henry Montgomery \u2014 is still behind bars nearly six decades after his 1963 arrest. That may change Wednesday when a Louisiana parole board votes for the third time whether to grant Montgomery parole.\u201cThe state has gotten about fifty-eight years of Henry Montgomery\u2019s life. He doesn\u2019t have much left. What\u2019s the value in making him spend a couple more years there? I, for one, cannot see it,\u201d said Andrew Hundley who runs the Louisiana Parole Project that will provide a home and support for Montgomery should he be released.Montgomery was arrested after fatally shooting Charles Hurt, an East Baton Rouge sheriff\u2019s deputy, who caught him skipping school. Montgomery was 17 at the time. He was initially sentenced to death but the state's Supreme Court threw out his conviction in 1966, saying he didn't get a fair trial. The case was retried, Montgomery convicted again but this time sentenced to life in prison.When Montgomery went to prison, and for decades afterward, the \u201clock-'em-up-and-throw-away-the-key\u201d attitude dominated law enforcement and society \u2014 especially in Louisiana where the incarceration rate has consistently been the highest in the country. Juvenile offenders, often portrayed as irredeemable \u201csuper-predators,\u201d were no exception.But recent Supreme Court rulings have begun to chip away at these lifetime juvenile sentences as the country has begun to rethink \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d approaches.In 2012, in Miller v. Alabama, the court ruled that mandatory sentencing of life without parole for juvenile offenders was \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment. The court\u2019s decision was based on the idea that children\u2019s minds and impulse controls are still developing, and they often act recklessly. The court found that juveniles are capable of growth and change and, except in the most severe cases, should be given the opportunity to get out of prison.In 2016, the Supreme Court took up Montgomery\u2019s case and made their earlier decision retroactive, giving hundreds of juvenile lifers a shot at freedom.Since the court's Montgomery decision, about 800 people who had been sentenced to life without parole as juveniles have been released,         according to the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth. About 656 people are serving life without parole for crimes they committed as children \u2014 down from 2,800 about five years ago \u2014 the organization said.Advocates also point to the sweeping changes that have happened in the near-decade since Miller was decided. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have completely banned the use of life without parole for juveniles offenders \u2014 compared to five states in 2012. In another six states, the sentence still exists but no juveniles are serving life without parole.In Louisiana, about 96 out of roughly 300 former juvenile lifers incarcerated at the time of the Montgomery decision have been freed, according to data compiled by the Parole Project and         the Louisiana Center for Children's Rights,  which represents kids going through the justice system. But Louisiana has not done away with the life without parole sentence for juveniles, and advocates at the LCCR say just as many children are being sentenced to life without parole in the years after the Supreme Court's pivotal 2012 ruling as after it \u2014 usually children of color.When Montgomery started serving his time at Angola it was a violent place, where attacks on inmates and guards were commonplace. There was little in the way of rehabilitative programs, especially not for prisoners who were never expected to experience freedom again.Some of the programs like the boxing club were ones that Montgomery himself helped start, say supporters. He's worked for years at the prison's silk screen shop where one of his lawyers during the last parole board hearing said he'd been named employee of the month more times that she could count.During the last year the coronavirus has limited Montgomery's contact with the outside world, his lawyer Keith Nordyke said. The elderly Montgomery is extremely hard of hearing, making Zoom calls difficult, Nordyke said. In previous parole hearings Montgomery has struggled to understand what is being said.Hurt, the sheriff's deputy who Montgomery killed, was married and had three children. Two of his daughters have met with Montgomery in prison and forgiven him, but family members have opposed his release. Hurt's grandson J.P. deGravelles, who is also in law enforcement, said the family is not acting out of vindictiveness and if Montgomery is granted parole, deGravelles wishes him well. But his grandfather will never get such an opportunity at life again.\u201cThis is not a witch hunt for us. We just we think he was given a sentence, and he was given a just sentence and he should carry it out,\" deGravelles said. \u201cThe killing of a police officer is a direct assault on the very fabric of society.\"Should Montgomery be granted parole, he'll become a client of the Louisiana Parole Project. The organization \u2014 started in 2016 by Hundley who is a former juvenile lifer himself \u2014 helps offenders who've served long sentences reenter society. They'd provide Montgomery with a place to stay and help him with important steps to reentering society such as getting an ID card, signing up for health insurance, learning how to use a cellphone or computer and making sure he has his medications.Hundley worries if Montgomery doesn't get paroled this time, he could die in prison. In 2019, the three member board voted 2-1 in favor of letting him out, but the decision had to be unanimous. This time, a simple majority would suffice. Hundley has asked Montgomery what he would like to do if he is released.\u201cHe wants to be able to look at sunrise without looking at it through razor wire. That is what he is looking forward to. That\u2019s what he thinks about,\" Hundley said."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/bts-covid-19-pandemics-mental-toll-bands-viral/story?id=80195049", "headline": "BTS on COVID-19 pandemic's mental toll, band's viral UN appearance", "source": "ABC News", "date": "September 24, 2021, 12:15 PM", "text": "Korean musical sensation BTS opened up in an exclusive interview with ABC News about the mental toll the COVID-19 pandemic has had on them and the depression they've dealt with over the past year and a half.Several of the band's members said they felt a sense of loss during this time when they were unable to perform.

After being convicted of second-degree murder in 1993 and sentenced to life without parole, Reynolds spent his days in the Angola prison using his certification in American Sign Language to assist deaf inmates and working as a hospice volunteer.It was those same skills, Reynolds said in an interview with ABC News, that he had hoped he could use to begin rebuilding his life and give back to the society that had given him a second chance after he was released under Louisiana sentencing reforms.However, like thousands of other former prisoners released in the months since the start of the public health crisis, Reynolds\u2019 hopes of landing on his feet have been brought to a virtual standstill because of the COVID-19 crisis.Weeks into a new job with the Baton Rouge Community College as a sign language interpreter, the school was forced to cancel classes for the foreseeable future. In his second effort at employment, Reynolds said he has seen his hours cut at a local animal shelter from 40 to roughly 15 per week.Reynolds now spends most of his days confined to his halfway home with the Louisiana Parole Project, a group that provides housing and transition services for former prisoners who have completed long sentences.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much similar to incarceration,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cIt\u2019s like I left a prison \u2013 incapacitated inside of the walls of the prison, to incapacitated inside the confines of the house that I\u2019m living in.\u201dWith federal, state and local leaders around the country looking to speed up inmate releases and transfers to reduce crowding in institutions vulnerable to the spread of the virus, a population of recently-freed prisoners who in normal times faces daunting challenges reentering society is now staring down a more extensive and diverse series of obstacles than ever before, not only threatening their economic security, but their physical health and others'.Advocate groups and other field experts who spoke to ABC News described an over-stressed system in which workers are faced with tough choices and a delicate balance in transitioning those once locked up back into communities on lockdown, while keeping themselves and the former inmates safe.\u201cAs of now, we've been doing outreach and conducting surveys with reentry service providers all over the country,\u201d  Lenore Anderson, President of the Alliance for Safety and Justice, a nonprofit criminal justice reform organization told ABC News. \u201cAnd right now, most are really struggling to safely operate even for the people that live there.\u201dIn addition to the prisoners like Reynolds, who were already scheduled to be released after serving their time, thousands of others at different stages in the judicial process were selected to be released from incarceration in an effort to protect them and the rest of the prison and jail populations from the virus.MORE: 1st federal inmate dies in prison hit hard by coronavirus after heartbreaking plea to judgeIn late March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom cleared the way for accelerating the release of nearly 3,500 inmates from the state's prison system. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has also announced the early release of some offenders out of the city's jails, including at least 650 from Riker's Island prison. And in accordance with a directive from Attorney General William Barr, the federal prison system has released more than 700 prisoners as of Thursday to serve the remainder of their terms on home confinement, which Barr has emphasized is separate from mass releases of prisoners into the general public.Seth Wenig/AP, FILEIn this June 20, 2014, file photo, the Rikers Island jail complex stands in New York is shown with the Manhattan skyline in the background.As coronavirus appears in prisons, safety equipment shortages hit half-way housesJust as hospitals and prisons are grappling with shortages in personal protective equipment to handle the sick, halfway houses and others whose job requires face-to-face interactions with the recently incarcerated have raised similar concerns.\u201cThese service providers need masks, they need gloves, they need toiletries, they need food supplies, they need the ability to operate safely, even for the people who are already there, much less additional people coming in,\u201d Anderson said.Some prisons have proven to be breeding grounds for the virus. Rikers Island jail in New York City, for example, has been especially hard hit with dozens of inmates and staff testing positive for coronavirus, as ABC News reported in late March.As inmates are released from Rikers and other jails and prisons in an effort to blunt the spread of the virus in the facilities, however, there is concern some could bring it out with them.\"The key is trying to make sure that the folks that were coming from the system have no symptomatic indications that they might be infected,\" said Dan Lombardo, the President of Volunteers of America\u2019s Delaware Valley region, which operates several halfway houses.If they do appear symptomatic, Lombardo says halfway houses have to decide how best to isolate them from others.He said his organization\u2019s workers have been conducting screenings, frequent temperature checks and regular sanitization practices but have still seen individuals with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 diagnoses in its facilities. Health officials have said some people with coronavirus may not show symptoms, making screening all the more difficult.\u201cSo we're worried that, it's like -- you wonder if it's a ticking time bomb,\u201d Lombardo said. \u201cIs this the beginning, or is this something that we abated? And it's like, hold your breath and wait.\u201dThen there's the matter of routine medical care for the recently released. At the facility housing Reynolds, a new emerging difficulty has been providing former inmates the medical services they need, according to the project\u2019s deputy director Kerry Myers.\u201cIt's very hard to get an appointment right now at any clinic for a new patient that's not COVID-19-related,\u201d Myers said. \u201cSo what we're having is a bit of an issue getting their medications refilled, they come from prison with about a 30-day supply depending on the medication, but once that's up, that has to be refilled and pharmacies aren't going to accept just a prescription number or a pill bottle from the prison.\u201dEconomic standstill hits halfway houses, settlement plans fall throughEven as the project continues admitting more former inmates, Myers said they\u2019ve seen much of their funding dry up due to the economic standstill, between a slowed flow in private donations and fundraisers canceled to comply with social distancing policies.Ron Stefanski, the founder of Prison Insight, an organization that advocates for transparency in the criminal justice system, told ABC News that the financial struggles facing halfway houses were systemic even prior to the coronavirus.\u201cHalfway houses in general, they're tough, because they usually rely on public funding and itself a lot of the time,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201cThey don't last very long and then, what I find is that a lot of new ones pop up, and then the old ones go away.\u201dAndrew Souffle/Chicago Tribune via Tribune News Service via Getty Images, FILEIn this January 25, 2013, file photo, a halfway house in Chicago is shown.For recently released prisoners, the availability of a halfway house could be the difference between sleeping in a bed or out on the street.\u201cBecause if their family isn't there, usually they're going to a halfway house,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201cAnd then if that's not happening, then they go into homeless shelters, and if that is not happening, then they're out there just going completely homeless.\u201dBarbara Banaszynski, a senior vice president at Volunteers of America overseeing the group\u2019s offender reentry programs, said the group has sought to coordinate closely with state and federal partners to conduct releases in a way that doesn\u2019t jeopardize the safety of the former inmates or the locations they\u2019re sent to.While the VOA typically provides services to between 30,000 and 40,000 formerly incarcerated people per year, Banaszynski said a worrying trend as of late has been more prisoners released having their settlement plans fall through.\u201cThose are the people that I'm really worried about -- those people that, for one reason or another, even if it was a good release plan, it fails,\u201d Banaszynski said. \u201cAnd in this pandemic kind of situation, with limited amounts of beds and trying to keep people from entering in and out and bringing infection, facilities have limited options and they are on the street or trying to gain entry to a shelter situation and really aren't getting the release help that they need.\u201dAt the federal level, the Bureau of Prisons told ABC News it has sought to help former inmates required to make \"subsistence payments\" as a part of residency in halfway houses by waiving those payments temporarily for those who may be out of a job due to the economic crisis.There are currently 7,368 former federal inmates in halfway houses, and the BOP says it is working closely with staff at the housing centers to transfer individuals who may be eligible for home confinement as an alternative -- in particular those in high-risk categories for COVID-19 identified by the CDC.Stressors for parole officers, front-line workers as wellA great deal of burden in care-taking is also likely being put on those tasked with conducting regular check-ups on the released inmates, according to former FBI Agent and federal parole officer Brad Garrett.\u201cThe reality is that halfway houses, working with parole authorities, will send more inmates directly back into the community, placing supervision on parole officers, many of whom already have unmanageable caseloads,\u201d Garrett, now an ABC News contributor said.In tandem with social distancing policies implemented across the country, many states have temporarily suspended in-person check ins at probations and parole offices, though several are still requiring check ins on clients deemed \"high or very-high risk\" of recidivism.For those parole officers and other workers whose job typically requires in-person interactions with the formerly incarcerated, the strains of balancing personal safety with carrying out your duties responsibly is more challenging than ever before.\u201cI think it says a lot about these frontline workers who, you know, frankly, it'd be easy to just go home and collect unemployment,\u201d Banaszynski said. \u201cBut they haven't seen mass exodus. You know, these are, these tend to be younger workers who work on the front lines, their schools are closed, their children's schools are closed, the daycares are closed. You know, they're juggling to come to work, and that they're coming to work is a big testament to people's fidelity to mission.\u201dAs he continues to look for ways to get his life back on track, Reynolds told ABC News that he spends much of his recent days speaking with his former fellow inmates at Angola, including video chats with deaf prisoners he previously counseled.\u201cWhen you grow up in prison like I did, those guys that you become close with, they become your family,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen countless people leave that prison, and when they leave I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because they become overwhelmed with their freedom, or its just so much other stuff that they have missed by being away in prison that we kind of lose contact.

Activities include a blood drive, food distribution and cleanups of Jewish cemeteries.Coinciding with the commemoration will be publication of an         anthology of essays by Pittsburgh-area writers, reflecting on how the attack impacted them and their community. Co-editor Beth Kissileff is the wife of Rabbi Jonathan Perlman, who took shelter in a supply closet with three members of his New Light congregation during the attack. One of them, 87-year-old Melvin Wax, who was hearing impaired, as a result left the closet before it was safe, and was shot dead.Most of the commemorations were planned by a group that included the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, the Jewish Community Center and members of the three congregations. One of the group\u2019s co-chairs lost her brother in the shooting; the other lost her mother.Organizers have strived to offer emotional support. One-on-one counseling will be offered virtually, and there's a tent set up near the synagogue where people can access in-person support from humans and comfort dogs in a socially distanced environment.Planning committee member and Rabbi Amy Bardack, director of Jewish life and learning at the Jewish Federation, said the pandemic posed challenges.\u201cOnce you can\u2019t do everything in-person, there aren\u2019t as many opportunities for healing,\u201d she said. \u201cLast year we had chaplains, therapists helping people face-to-face. That can\u2019t happen this year.\u201dOf the three congregations based in the synagogue in 2018, only Tree of Life, the host, plans to return when the building reopens after renovation. There\u2019s no timeline yet for that project; the congregation has hired consultants to help with logistics and wants to accommodate other organizations and activities.Nearby Chatham University and the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh are expected to share some of the reconfigured space. There also will be a memorial to those killed in the attack.Before the pandemic, Tree of Life was holding services at Rodef Shalom, a historic temple completed in 1907. But since March, in-person worship and group activities have been halted in favor of virtual gatherings.Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said his appearances on Zoom and Facebook, livestreamed from his living room, have gained a loyal following, including a woman in Australia who joins Tuesday classes in which he discusses prayers offered the preceding Friday.\u201cDuring the pandemic, people are seeking community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try in any way to help them find solace and hope and inspiration.\u201dA second congregation, Dor Hadash, also had been worshipping at Rodef Shalom and plans to return there once the pandemic eases enough to allow in-person services, according to its president, Donna Coufal.She said Dor Hadash has remained politically active, engaging issues such as racial justice and gun violence.The third, New Light, had been at the Beth Shalom synagogue in the same Squirrel Hill neighborhood where the attack occurred. Congregation co-president Stephen Cohen said the arrangement has worked well and New Light plans to remain there long-term.Of the three, only New Light has resumed in-person services, but Cohen said most members, many of whom are over 70, remain wary and participate via Zoom. The 15 or so who attend in person wear masks and sit at least 6 feet apart.\u201cBefore March we were beginning to recreate our community, and then on March 23 it all falls apart,\u201d Cohen said, referring to the imposition of a stay-at-home order. \u201cWe have adapted as best we can.\"The idea for the anthology arose from conversations among New Light members, encouraged by Kissileff, an author and essayist. She recruited as co-editor Eric Lidji, a Pittsburgh-based historian who has overseen efforts to preserve documentation of the 2018 attack.They in turn brought in 22 other writers, journalists, academics and rabbis to contribute to the anthology, \u201cBound in the Bond of Life.\u201dThe entries include poetry, oral history and an essay by Carnegie Mellon University historian Laura Zittrain Eisenberg about the memorials that sprung up outside the synagogue after the attack and items left there \u2014 flowers, candles, a guitar, a pair of sneakers.Kissileff and Lidji included three non-Jews among the contributors: Peter Smith, religion writer for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; Tony Norman, a Post-Gazette columnist; and Campbell Robertson, a Pittsburgh-based New York Times correspondent.\u201cI wanted to acknowledge this didn\u2019t just affect the Jewish community,\u201d Kissileff said.In his essay, \u201cI Read Somewhere That Pittsburgh is Stronger Than Hate,\u201d Norman, who is Black, evoked other mass shootings such as the 2015 attack by a racist gunman that killed nine Black people gathered for Bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.\u201cWe know that there\u2019s hate in Pittsburgh,\u201d Norman wrote. \u201cBut as the Tree of Life massacre showed us, there is also considerable pushback to evil. While much of the nation was still in shock, the seeds of an extraordinary response took root in a city often divided by race and class.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

But he has turned his tears to action.His \"Solidarity Menu\" project works with a delivery start up, Rappi. People can order and pay for food online that his employees prepare for delivery to families in poor neighborhoods.Moscoso estimates that more than half of the burgers go to Venezuelan migrants who have fled hunger in their home country; many are at risk of the virus because they live in close quarters in shelters or are homeless. Many work in Colombia\u2019s vast informal economy, selling everything from flowers to pens in the streets of its major cities.\"The other day I delivered 600 burgers to two tough neighborhoods of Bogota and there were families who had not eaten for days,\" Moscoso said.\"It's very moving what's happening with just nine days of a lockdown. I can\u2019t imagine what will happen with 20, 30 or 40 days, and people not being able to go out and make a living.\u201dSo far, according to official figures, 798 people in Colombia have been infected and 14 have died.Like many nations in Latin America, Colombia\u2019s health care system is already stretched and is struggling to ensure there are enough hospital beds, respirators and medical staff to deal with a high influx of patients with complications.\u201cHere in Latin America there\u2019s a lot of concern because governments lack the resources to feed the population, so what we\u2019re doing is appealing to people\u2019s solidarity and people who are perhaps more well-off, so they can buy Solidarity Menus for those who will need it,\u201d Moscoso said.Colombia has taken strict measures to halt the coronavirus spread, grounding international flights, closing schools and ordering a nationwide quarantine until April 13.Restaurants, cafes and retail shops have been hit hard as the government tries to curb the spread of the virus. Moscoso closed his restaurants voluntarily March 16 to all but takeout and deliveries.He said he is not making a profit from Solidarity Menus, but the project is keeping his staff active. He has vowed not to lay off any of his employees, among them people with Down syndrome and who are deaf.Above all, Moscoso said that he has been surprised by the kindness of strangers, including restaurant owners and others have reached out to join his initiative.\u201cRight now, our phones are ringing off the hook with people searching for ways to help.

Now the rest of the nation gets to start participating in the once-a-decade head count. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions.WHEN WILL I HEAR FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU?The Census Bureau will begin sending out notices this week to 95% of the nation's households, informing people that they can start participating in the 2020 census. The mailings will be staggered, going out from March 12 to 20 to avoid overwhelming          the self-response website and a telephone helpline. About 80% of households receiving the initial mailings will be encouraged to answer the questions online, and around 20% of households will get a paper questionnaire that can be mailed back because they live in neighborhoods with low internet access or large numbers of seniors.For less than 5% of households, in areas that have been hit by natural disaster or places that use only PO boxes, a census taker will drop off the initial notices in person. Census takers will eventually go home to home, interviewing residents of households that have not responded.\u2014\u2014\u2014WILL SOMEONE BE KNOCKING AT MY DOOR?Only if you fail to reply online, by mail or by telephone. This is the first census in which the Census Bureau is encouraging most people to answer the questions via the internet. The Census Bureau's initial mailing in mid-March will be followed by a reminder letter a week later and a postcard reminder a week after that. If you still haven't responded by April, you will get another reminder with a paper questionnaire in the mail, followed by a final reminder postcard. By May, the Census Bureau will be sending out workers to knock on the doors of households they haven't heard back from.\u2014\u2014\u2014WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS?The form asks how many people live in the household as of April 1, whether the home is owned or rented, and the form-filler's age and sex. They ask people to identify themselves by race, declare whether they're Hispanic or not, and provide details about their country of origin. All other residents in the household must answer, or have the first form-filler answer for them, the same questions on age, sex, race and Hispanic origin. They must specify their relationship to the form-filler and if they live elsewhere, like away at college. For the first time, same-sex couples will be able to identify as such, either as spouses or unmarried partners.\u2014\u2014\u2014IS THERE A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION?No. The Trump administration tried to add the question, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocked it.\u2014\u2014\u2014WHAT IF I DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH?Besides English, respondents will be able to answer the census questionnaire in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Russian, Arabic, Tagalog, Polish, French, Haitian Creole, Portuguese and Japanese. Guides in both video and print are being issued in 59 languages, including American Sign Language.\u2014\u2014\u2014WHO GETS COUNTED?Everyone residing in the United States and the five U.S. territories, including non-citizens and immigrants living in the country illegally. Prisoners are counted in the facilities where they live, and military personnel temporarily deployed overseas are counted at their home addresses in the U.S.\u2014\u2014\u2014WILL MY INFORMATION BE SHARED?No. Under federal law, all responses are kept completely confidential, and they can be used only to produce statistics.\u2014\u2014\u2014WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?Because the 2020 census is used to determine who your representative in Congress is, where new businesses can build, how crowded your local schools will get over the next decade, and whether highways in your community get money for repairs. The results of the 2020 census help determine the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal spending, as well as how many congressional seats each state gets.\u2014\u2014\u2014HOW DOES THE CENSUS BUREAU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME?They don't start from scratch. The Census Bureau continually updates a complete inventory of housing units using an address list that shows them where to count. They get information from the U.S. Postal Service, tribal, state and local governments. Addresses that couldn't be verified using satellite images or mapping tools were checked door-to-door by canvassers last fall.\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP"}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/16-year-girl-falls-death-yorks-zoar-valley/story?id=72564167", "headline": "16-year-old girl falls to her death at New York's Zoar Valley - ABC ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "August 24, 2020, 10:11 AM", "text": "A 16-year-old girl died over the weekend after falling off a steep ledge in New York state's Zoar Valley, authorities said.Deputies from the Cattaraugus County Sheriff's Office along with New York State Police troopers responded to the scene near the tiny town of Otto on Saturday evening, after receiving several 911 calls about a girl who had fallen off a ledge in the nature reserve.

Businesses large and small are         already reporting drops in revenue and profits as companies and consumers cancel vacations and business trips.Many economists caution, though, that rate cuts and other Fed economic tools might not do much to blunt the economic damage resulting from the virus.\u201cThe fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong,\u201d Powell said in a statement. \u201cHowever, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201dSuch statements from the Fed are unusual and tend to come during crises that cause widespread fears in financial markets. Similar comments were issued after the October 1987 market crash and after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\"Powell\u2019s statement is a strong signal that the Fed is about to cut rates, and it is highly likely that this will be a series of cuts,\u201d said Sung Won Sohn, an economics and finance professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.Many economists have urged rate cuts to help allay anxieties and support the economy and markets. Economists from Bank of America said Friday that they expect the Fed to cut its benchmark short-term rate by a half-percentage point at its March meeting, which would be twice the typical size of a cut and the largest since the Great Recession.Investors are increasingly envisioning that the Fed will act soon. On Friday afternoon, traders priced in a 100% likelihood that the central bank would make at least a quarter-point cut in March, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's          Fedwatch tool. The odds of a half-point cut were just above 50%. That's up sharply from a week a week ago, when the likelihood of a modest quarter-point cut was put at 11%.Stocks remained volatile after Powell's mid-afternoon statement, though they rallied toward the close of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 357 points after having briefly been done more than 1,000.It's unclear what economic benefit a Fed rate cut, even a sizable one, might provide. The main economic consequence of the viral outbreak so far is the disruption of global manufacturing supply chains in China, South Korea and Japan, all of which have been hit by the disease. Lower interest rates wouldn't be able to repair those breakdowns, especially because global borrowing rates are already ultra-low.Lower rates typically encourage consumers to borrow and spend more. But if the COVID-19 becomes a global pandemic that forces widespread quarantines and closes businesses and restaurants, looser credit might not do much to improve confidence and economic activity.Still, Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics, said rate cuts could help the economy by soothing financial markets as well as by supporting lending. Many highly indebted companies might face higher borrowing costs if the economy slows, and a Fed rate cut could offset that effect. Corporations have shied away from issuing new bonds this week, she said, fearing that they would have to pay higher rates.And plunging stock markets can also lower consumer confidence and reduce spending, even among Americans who don't own shares. That could weaken the economy.A rate cut would \u201ccalm the financial markets\u201d and show \u201cthe Fed is not turning a deaf ear to the turmoil,\u201d Bostjancic said.Late Friday, President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of the Fed for not cutting rates more aggressively, was asked about the topic.\"I hope the Fed gets involved, and I hope they get involved soon,\" Trump said on the White House lawn.\u2014\u2014AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/90-year-couple-reunites-wife-recovers-covid-19/story?id=71226343", "headline": "90-year-old couple reunites after wife recovers from COVID-19 ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "June 12, 2020, 10:50 PM", "text": "Joyce and Don Hoffman had been apart for a month after she came down with COVID-19 on May 1.It's the longest they'd ever been apart during their 67-year marriage.Hoffman FamilyDon and Joyce Hoffman were separated for a month when she got COVID-19.Thankfully, Joyce only suffered minor symptoms.

Bush over tax policy and then produced a book critical of the administration, died Saturday. He was 84.O\u2019Neill\u2019s son, Paul O\u2019Neill Jr. confirmed that his father died at his home in Pittsburgh after battling lung cancer for the last couple of years. After a few surgeries and chemotherapy, he decided against any further intervention four or five months ago, he said.\u201cThere was some family here and he died peacefully,\u201d the son said. \u201cBased on his situation, it was a good exit.\u201dA former head of aluminum giant Alcoa, O\u2019Neill served as Treasury secretary from 2001 to late 2002. He was forced to resign after he objected to a second round of tax cuts because of their impact on deficits.O\u2019Neill\u2019s blunt speaking style more than once got him in trouble as Treasury secretary. He sent the dollar into a tailspin briefly in his early days at Treasury when his comments about foreign exchange rates surprised markets. In the spring of 2001, O\u2019Neill jolted markets again when during Wall Street\u2019s worst week in 11 years, he blandly declared \u201cmarkets go up and markets go down.\u201dHe was more focused on the traditional Treasury secretary\u2019s job of instilling confidence during times of turbulence later that year when he helped get Wall Street re-opened after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. O\u2019Neill was also instrumental following the attacks in beefing up the government\u2019s programs to disrupt financing to terrorist groups.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Saturday on Twitter, \u201cSaddened to hear of the passing of the former 72nd Treasury Secretary, Paul O\u2019Neill. He served @USTreasury and America with distinction during challenging times. My condolences to his family.\u201dTony Fratto, who served as O\u2019Neill\u2019s Treasury spokesman, described O'Neill as a \u201cworking class guy\u201d who \"cared about how things impacted real people.\u201dFratto, currently a partner with Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington, said that one of O\u2019Neill\u2019s passions was workplace safety, and that he would tour the Treasury building looking for safety issues that needed to be fixed.After leaving the administration, O\u2019Neill worked with author Ron Suskind on an explosive book covering his two years in the administration. O\u2019Neill contended that the administration began planning the overthrow of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein right after Bush took office, eight months before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.O\u2019Neill depicted Bush as a disengaged president who didn\u2019t encourage debate either at Cabinet meetings or in one-on-one discussions with Cabinet members. He said the lack of discussion in Cabinet meetings gave him the feeling that Bush \u201cwas like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people.\u201dHe said major decisions were often made by Bush\u2019s political team and Vice President Dick Cheney. O\u2019Neill had been recruited to join the Cabinet by Cheney, his old friend from the Gerald Ford administration. But it was Cheney who told O\u2019Neill that the president wanted his resignation. It was part of a move by Bush to shake up his economic team and find a better salesman for a new round of tax cuts the president hoped would stimulate a sluggish economy.When the book, \u201cThe Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House and the Education of Paul O\u2019Neill\u201d came out in early 2004, Bush spokesman Scott McClellan discounted O\u2019Neill\u2019s descriptions of White House decision-making and said the president was \u201csomeone that leads and acts decisively on our biggest priorities.\u201dAfter leaving the Cabinet, O\u2019Neill returned to Pittsburgh, where he had headed Alcoa from 1987 to 1999. He resumed working with the Pittsburgh Regional Health Care Initiative, a consortium of hospitals, medical societies and businesses studying ways to improve health care delivery in Western Pennsylvania. The subject had interested him since his days as a budget analyst in Washington with the Office of Management and Budget.He also devoted time in retirement to projects that would deliver clean drinking water to Africa. As Treasury secretary, O\u2019Neill had focused attention on poverty and combating diseases such as AIDS in Africa, touring the continent with Irish rock star Bono.While at Alcoa, O\u2019Neill lifted the company out of the doldrums during his 12-year stint as the Pittsburgh company\u2019s CEO. Shortly after he took the job in April 1987, he began emphasizing factory safety and employee dignity as a top priority.His ideas weren\u2019t initially well received by profit-driven investors, who cared more about Alcoa\u2019s financial performance. After hearing one of O\u2019Neill\u2019s first presentations as Alcoa\u2019s CEO, one money manager decided the company had put a \u201ccrazy hippie in charge\u201d and advised his 20 largest clients to sell its stock, according to the book, \u201cThe Power of Habit\u201d by Charles Duhigg.That investor later called it one of his worst decisions. By the time, O\u2019Neill stepped down as CEO in 1999, Alcoa\u2019s accident rate had plunged and its stock had soared more than seven-fold at a time it was part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Before joining Alcoa, O\u2019Neill had been president from 1985 to 1987 of International Paper Co., a firm he had joined in 1977 after leaving OMB.After graduating with an economics degree from California State University in Fresno in 1961, O\u2019Neill joined the Veterans Administration in Washington, working as a computer systems analyst.

Grein, who came forward in 2018, has filed lawsuits in New York and New Jersey and testified in the canonical sex abuse case against McCarrick.Mitchell Garabedian, Grein's attorney, called for an investigation by law enforcement of why what he called a cover-up went on for decades.\u201cThis report really is not new news.

The summary says John Paul believed his handwritten denial.\u2014 The report also reveals the previously unknown contents of         six anonymous letters accusing McCarrick of pedophilia that were sent to U.S. church leaders in the early 1990s and later forwarded to the Holy See.\u2014 McCarrick, 90, was defrocked by Francis last year after a Vatican investigation confirmed decades of allegations that the globe-trotting envoy and successful church fundraiser had sexually molested adults as well as children.\u2014\u2014\u2014HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON:1 p.m.Bishop Accountability, which compiles a database of clergy publicly accused of sex abuse, is hailing the Vatican's report as \u201cthe most significant document on the abuse crisis to come from the Church.\u201dAnne Barrett Doyle is the group's co-director. She says that \u201cin many ways this is an impressive report \u2014 the Vatican\u2019s first forthright account of its own cover-up of a sexual predator.\u201dShe says it is \u201clong, detailed, and it names enablers,\" and adds that Bishop Accountability hopes it is the first step toward \u201cgenuine transparency.\u201dBarrett Doyle also says the McCarrick report has deficiencies, including its treatment of Pope Francis' role.\u201cIts greatest failure is that it lets Pope Francis off the hook: nobody gave him the files, he knew only that there had been rumors, etc.,\u201d she says. \u201cDidn\u2019t the Pope wonder if those rumors had substance? Anyone with an internet connection could have discovered they did. Francis\u2019 lack of curiosity was at best negligent, at worst corrupt.\u201dBarrett Doyle also notes the report doesn\u2019t account for McCarrick\u2019s handling of abusive priests in the dioceses he ran.\u2014\u2014\u2014NoonAn advocate in Argentina for survivors of clerical sex abuse says ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick caused tremendous hurt and laments that church officials knew but did not act.Julieta A\u00f1azco is the co-founder and former head of the Argentine Network of Survivors of Ecclestiastical Abuse and currently a member of Churches Without Abuses.She tells The Associated Press that \u201cthe damage and the pain that McCarrick cannot be calculated\u201d and that \u201ceveryone knew,\u201d including Saint John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, powerful cardinals and top Vatican officials.A\u00f1azco says \u201cany official could have put a stop to it, but they did not.\u201dA\u00f1azco praises the release of the Vatican\u2019s report on its investigation of the case, however, saying it is \u201cat least a step toward transparency.\u201dShe calls on Francis to publish findings on a school for the hearing-impaired in Mendoza province where dozens of students denounced abuse by clerics and lay workers. Two priests were convicted in the case last year and sentenced to more than 40 years in prison.\u2014\u2014\u201411:30 a.m.The bishop of the New Jersey diocese of Metuchen, which was headed by Theodore McCarrick when it was established in 1981, says he is \u201cdisgusted and appalled\u201d by the sex abuse scandal involving the ex-cardinal.Bishop James Checchio says that \u201cwhile I am grateful to Pope Francis for ordering this study to arrive at the \u2018truth\u2019 of what happened, like everyone else, I am disgusted and appalled by what has taken place.\u201dHe adds that the Vatican\u2019s report on its McCarrick investigation \u201cwill, undoubtedly, cause sadness, anxiety, frustration, anger, disgust and pain.\u201dChecchio says that since implementing new abuse prevention policies in 2002, the diocese \u201chas not received a single credible complaint of abuse involving a minor in any of our schools or parishes by diocesan clergy.\u201dHe laments that the diocese\u2019s founding will \u201calways be associated with the history of Theodore McCarrick and the culture of abuse, silence and shame that was allowed to perpetuate in the dark corners of our past,\u201d but says there is \u201ca new opportunity to lead lives of increased holiness.\u201dCardinal Timothy Dolan of New York is crediting the abuse survivors who approached the archdiocese with their allegations against McCarrick.Dolan says they \u201chelped bring this matter to light, proving that anyone who has abused a minor, even a cardinal, will be punished.\u201dHe says that when the first allegation was reported, church officials asked the Vatican for permission to arrange for an outside investigation and to have the issue judged by a lay review board, and Pope Francis responded by saying the case should be handled \u201cas you would for any priest accused of abuse.\u201dDolan praises Francis for trusting the processes followed by the archdiocese and others in the country, saying it \u201cwas very affirming, and will lead, I hope, to others having the confidence to come forward, knowing that their allegations will be handled seriously, sensitively, and appropriately.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u201410:45 a.m.The archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, says the Vatican\u2019s investigation of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick \u201crepresents a significant and powerful step forward in advancing accountability and transparency regarding sexual abuse.\u201dTobin says \u201cfailures by some leaders in the Catholic Church have wounded many,\u201d but \u201cthe Church has made progress in responding to clergy abuse by implementing and updating policies and programs to safeguard the faithful, especially the most vulnerable among us.\u201dCardinal-designate Wilton Gregory, archbishop of Washington D.C., says his \u201cheart hurts for all who will be shocked, saddened, scandalized and angered by the revelations\u201d in the report.Gregory says the disclosure is necessary if there is to be \u201ctrue redemptive healing.\u201d\u201cThis is an important, difficult and necessary document,\u201d Gregory says, \u201cand it demands prayerful, thorough and thoughtful reflection.\u201dAnd Los Angeles Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Gomez, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, says the McCarrick scandal is \u201canother tragic chapter in the Church\u2019s long struggle to confront the crimes of sexual abuse by clergy.\u201dHe expresses his \u201cprofound sorrow and deepest apologies\u201d to the ex-cardinal\u2019s victims, their families and all survivors of clerical sex abuse.\u201cThis report underscores the need for us to repent and grow in our commitment to serve the people of God,\u201d Gomez says.\u2014\u2014\u2014A lawyer whose firm is handling five cases naming Theodore McCarrick as a perpetrator of sex abuse says the Vatican's report on its investigation into the former cardinal \u201chas the potential to be an historic first step toward top-down transparency within the Catholic Church.\u201dAttorney Jeff Anderson says the report is \u201cunprecedented\u201d in that, for the first time, \u201cthe Vatican has engaged a third-party, non-clergy lawyer to conduct the investigation, collect the evidence, connect the dots, and expose not only a perpetrator, but a system that put children in peril for decades.\u201dAnderson says Pope Francis' actions going forward \"will determine if he will lead a Church thoroughly committed to the healing and justice it espouses by walking the hard road of accountability, or one willing to expose only its most notorious offender to keep our eyes off those hiding in the shadows.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014SNAP, a network representing survivors of clergy sex-abuse, is welcoming the Vatican\u2019s report on its investigation of former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick but says many more steps need to be taken to prevent abuse.The group calls for the removal of \u201cany prelate who was aware of McCarrick\u2019s crimes and did nothing,\" as well as \u201ca pope who is willing to talk earnestly and often about what actions he is taking to combat clergy abuse worldwide.\u201dSNAP says the abuse crisis is an ongoing one, and transparency and accountability are still lacking.It calls the report \u201cone step in the right direction\u201d but says the Vatican must ensure that past mistakes will not be repeated.\u201cAwareness is good,\u201d it says. \u201cBut awareness is meaningless without concrete action.\u201d"},

in a joint \u201cAmen!\u201dNot a voice could be heard inside the cavernous sanctuary of Holyrood Episcopal Church-Iglesia Santa Cruz in Manhattan. There was no need for words: From the altar, the deaf congregants led the hearing ones, who from the wooden pews repeated the silent movement of their hands.Music, sermons, prayers, even confessions make up much of the experience of a typical religious service. So, for the deaf, how does faith flourish in an environment that so revolves around sound?The deaf worshippers at Holyrood in the northern edge of Manhattan, say that what might be considered a limitation has strengthened their sense of community, and expanded their understanding of God, and the sacred gift of silence in a noisy world.During a recent Sunday service, deaf and hearing worshippers sung and signed hymns, offered the sign of peace bringing palms together with a twisting motion - and joyfully waved their hands high in the air in a sign-language equivalent of applause.\u201cWhen I sign the music and the hymns to God, I actually feel the Holy spirit with me. I give my all to him,\u201d said Lidia Martinez, 54, who spoke to the AP through her daughter, who is a sign language interpreter.Growing up in the Dominican Republic, Martinez felt alienated from her faith because she was deaf. When she moved to the U.S. in 1993, she continued to feel like an outsider in a hearing church.\u201cI remember going to other churches and sitting in the benches and not knowing what they were saying because there were no interpreters available,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really hard to follow the Mass with just the readings.\u201dAfter visiting multiple churches, she walked into Holyrood last year. That\u2019s when she saw the Rev. Maria Santiviago signing from the pulpit.\u201cIt was heartwarming to have her interpret the Mass,\u201d she said about Santiviago, a 77-year-old Paraguayan who came out of retirement to help lead the ministry for the deaf. \u201cBefore I wasn\u2019t understanding anything. This was like a Eureka moment.\u201dNow, her whole family is part of the Holyrood community. They recently walked into the church past the Nativity scene and a brightly lit Christmas tree and sat in the front pews, illuminated by sunlight from colorful stained-glass windows. Her husband, Carlos Tirado, 54, who is also deaf, signed. Her daughter Leisha Martinez, 11, and her granddaughters, Arly Gordon, 8, and Lyann Gordon, 4, who can hear, sang along.Facing them - and all the deaf worshippers - stood her eldest daughter, Diely Martinez, an American Sign Language/Spanish medical interpreter, who now volunteers at the Sunday Mass.\u201cI want (God) to touch their lives, she said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s more than interpreting. It\u2019s a calling.\u201dDuring the service, the Rev. Luis Barrios asked the deaf and hearing worshippers to form a prayer chain around a congregant who fears that she\u2019s also losing her sight.The Sunday service for the deaf and a weekday American Sign Language classes have helped once-dwindling attendance to rise at the Gothic Revival-style church.\u201cGod can also be found in the silence,\u201d Santiviago said. \u201cWe\u2019re empowering their language.\u201dHolyrood, which is located in the mostly Latino neighborhood of Washington Heights, also takes pride in being a sanctuary church for immigrants and fully trilingual in English, Spanish and ASL.\u201cWe have revived this church. We wanted the church to support the people,\u201d Barrios, who is from Puerto Rico, said. \u201cWe need to find ways to make changes so the church remains relevant.\u201d He said that they still hope to reach out to more children and teenagers.Technological advances, including apps for texting and talking, continue to help the deaf and hard of hearing worldwide. But, Diely Martinez said, a church for the deaf and hearing - like Holyrood - is vital.\u201cEvery Sunday, we come here and we\u2019re a family. It can be deaf friends; it can be my immediate family. But not only that,\u201d she said. \u201cI can see how the hearing people are more accepting of the deaf, and that\u2019s very touching.

Some said they've been denied wheelchairs and a deaf detainee who communicates in American Sign Language said he has not been provided an interpreter.The problems harm disabled immigrants and threaten anyone in one of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's more than 50,000 detention beds who winds up getting sick or isolated from other detainees, said Monica Porter, staff attorney at Disability Rights Advocates, one of the organizations that filed the suit.\"ICE cannot simply contract with third parties to operate its detention centers and then wash its hands of the deplorable, unlawful conditions in those detention centers,\" said Tim Fox, co-executive director of the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center.ICE, which largely contracts with private companies and law enforcement agencies for detention space, declined to comment specifically about the lawsuit.An agency official said comprehensive medical care is provided to all detainees including dental and 24-hour emergency care and studies have shown about 1 percent of detainees are held in segregated housing at a given time.The lawsuit filed on behalf of 15 immigrants from countries including Sudan and Mexico and nonprofits seeks to represent immigrant detainees across the country. The suit cites problems at eight facilities including a privately-run center in Adelanto California, and Teller County Jail in Colorado.Advocates said they want to see changes in medical treatment and policies for the immigrants, who are fighting deportation, and the release of immigrants under alternative programs.The number of immigrants in detention has grown in recent years. There are currently an average 55,000 immigrants in detention each day, according to ICE.One of the plaintiffs, Faour Abdullah Fraihat, has been detained in Adelanto for more than two years and lost vision in his left eye. While an off-site doctor recommended surgery in April, immigration authorities didn't provide it and he was told last month his vision couldn't be restored, according to the lawsuit.Fraihat, 57, who has back and knee pain, said he was given a wheelchair but it was taken away after a month. For more than a year, he relied on officers to bring him food, the suit said.He said he fears returning to Jordan because he was threatened after converting to Christianity.Another detainee at the facility about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles said he was placed in segregation for a week after filing a grievance against an officer, the suit said.Luis Manuel Delgadillo, a 29-year-old who has lived most of his life in the United States, was on medication for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder but his treatment shifted after he was detained in May.

Then, the talk-show circuit, from Phil Donahue to Oprah Winfrey. And later, a TV special in which Mary Jo and Joey Buttafuoco faced off against shooter Amy Fisher.In new interviews with \"20/20,\" which also include never-before-seen family home videos, the couple, now divorced, and their only daughter, Jessie Buttafuoco, describe their journey after that fateful day.Watch the full story on \"20/20\" FRIDAY, Nov. 8 at 9 p.m. ETJessie Buttafuoco, who was 9 years old at the time of the shooting, spoke openly not only about how the shooting and media frenzy around it has affected her life \u2014 even as an adult \u2014 but also about how she is finally ready to heal and reclaim dignity for the family name.\"Growing up for me, the performing arts was my outlet. When I was on stage, I was a character. I wasn't Jessie Buttafuoco, and it was so nice to get out of that reality,\" she told \"20/20.\" \"My friends call me 'Showtime' because I can be on. I can make you laugh and I can make you happy and smile.

And somebody had to take me outta line, and said, 'You have to get your stuff. You have to go,'\" Jessie Buttafuoco remembered of the day her mom was shot.Jessie and Mary Jo Buttafuoco told ABC News that while they are not trying to escape the past, they're now focused on moving forward with their lives and continuing to heal from the collateral damage caused by the trauma.\"I'm really trying to get deep and figure out why I operate the way I operate and how I can change and be a better person and help other people along the way,\" Jessie Buttafuoco said. \"What makes me the most sad, to be honest, is my complete inability to be able to love somebody because of all this. Since I was 9 years old, all I\u2019ve known is that sex and love and intimacy leads to bad things. It\u2019s extremely hard for me to even think that love exists. It\u2019s really hard to change because I\u2019ve missed out on that.\"Amy Fisher shoots Mary Jo ButtafuocoOn May 19, 1992, Mary Jo Buttafuoco sent her children off to school from the family\u2019s home in Massapequa on Long Island, New York. Her doorbell rang around noon, and when she reached the front door, a young woman was standing there. Behind the young woman, a man sat in a car.Mary Jo Buttafuoco said the young woman, who claimed to be 19 years old and called herself \"Anne Marie,\" showed her a Complete Auto Body T-shirt advertising a local auto body shop where Joey Buttafuoco worked. The young woman said it was proof that her then-husband was having a relationship with her 16-year-old sister.\"I kinda said, 'Look, Anne Marie, I don't know what you want me to do about this,'\" Mary Jo Buttafuoco said. \"And I believe I said, because I was raised to be a good Catholic girl, 'Thanks for coming by.' And with that, I turned my head, went for the door and that was the end of my life as I knew it.\" After the shooting, there was zero degree of normalcy. That's all I wanted. All I wanted was to be normal but it was a rough, rough timeThe young woman shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco once in the head. The bullet broke her jaw and severed her carotid artery before getting lodged at the base of her brain above her spinal column. She was in surgery for seven hours but doctors were not able to remove the bullet.\"They told us, 'She's going to die. She'll be blind, paralyzed, deaf.'  \u2026 They just knew she could die,\" said Mary Jo Buttafuoco's sister Eileen, who asked that only her first name be used. \"The surgeon said to my mother, 'What do you want to do?' \u2026 And she said, 'Let's go for it,' meaning let's have her have surgery.\"(MORE: Mary Jo Scoffs at Joey and Amy's Second Shot at Love)ABC\"I get a phone call from a neighbor to come home, there\u2019s an emergency,\" Joey Buttafuoco remembered about learning his wife had been shot.She was in surgery for seven hours but doctors were not able to remove the bullet.When she woke up from surgery, Mary Jo Buttafuoco identified the shooter as a 19-year-old named Anne Marie who had shown her a Complete Auto Body t-shirt. Joey Buttafuoco recognized the shirt as one that he'd given to a man named Elliott Fisher, who had a daughter: 17-year-old Amy Fisher, who lived with her parents in Merrick, Long Island.Fisher was arrested and charged with first-degree attempted murder. Fisher claimed she'd been having a sexual relationship with Joey Buttafuoco, according to Maria Eftimiades, author of \"Lethal Lolita.\"At the time the relationship began in the summer of 1991, Joey Buttafuoco was 36 and Amy Fisher was 16, nearly one month shy of her 17th birthday. She was still considered a minor under New York State law. Mary Jo Buttafuoco said that when she confronted her husband about the relationship with Fisher, he denied it.\"Joey is a fabulous liar. I did not realize that then. I didn't realize how much he manipulated me and lied to me, but he did,\" she said. \"Joe was adamant. He screamed from the rooftops [that] he had nothing to do with her sexually \u2014 nothing. ... I know I did go home and ask Joe a million times, 'Did you have sex with her?' And a million times he denied it. And a million times he swore to me on our children's lives, so I thought he's got to be telling me the truth. He denied it. Then, I believed him.\"Joey Buttafuoco now tells ABC News that his relationship with Fisher had been \"inappropriate.\"\"That's as far as I\u2019m gonna go with that,\" he said.(MORE: Mary Jo Buttafuoco's 'Life Lift')After Fisher was arrested, she told authorities that the shooting was an accident. But two men named Steven Sleeman and Chris Drellos came forward, claiming that she'd approached them months before the shooting to ask them to help her kill Mary Jo Buttafuoco.Bruce Parnell, who represented Sleeman, said that Fisher and Sleeman went to the Buttafuoco home on Nov. 1, 1991, with the intention that he would shoot Mary Jo Buttafuoco but claims that he never fired because he couldn\u2019t get a clear shot. He said Fisher was irate.Sleeman was granted immunity. Drellos came forward after Sleeman, saying he had refused to assist Fisher.ABC NewsMary Jo Buttafuoco spoke to \"20/20\" 27 years after the fateful shooting that nearly killed her and certainly changed her life forever.In a surprise admission, Sleeman revealed to ABC News that he actually went back by himself to the Buttafuocos' a few weeks later and shot into their home with a long-scope .22 hunting rifle.\"I happened to be in my car and no one was in the house. Had her lined up in my sights. And I put two shots through the window. \u2026 I saw her, a shadow, in the window. But I didn't know if I hit her. I was too scared,\" he said.Mary Jo and Jessie Buttafuoco told ABC News that the family had seen a bullet hole and thought it had come from some mischievous neighborhood children. The bullet had entered through the front living room window and gone into a wall in the living room. The police had even been called, Jessie Buttafuoco said, and her mother filed a report. Mary Jo Buttafuoco was unharmed because she had left the room.After Fisher was apprehended for the May 1992 shooting of Mary Jo Buttafuoco, police also arrested Peter Guagenti, who was the man Mary Jo had seen sitting in the car that day, and charged him as Fisher's accomplice. Guagenti was convicted of criminal sale of a weapon for providing the gun to Fisher and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution against her. He received a reduced jail sentence of four months.While Fisher's defense tried to present her as a na\u00efve, high school senior manipulated by an older man, it was revealed that Fisher had worked for an escort service, Eftimiades said. And a television show aired a portion of a sex tape that one of Fisher's clients had secretly recorded and sold to the program.As Fisher's trial neared, tabloid TV producers descended on Massapequa with gifts and money to get people to talk. Mary Jo Buttafuoco said the focus of the case in the media and public's eye changed. It was no longer about how she was shot; it was about Joey Buttafuoco and Amy Fisher.In late July 1992, a judge released Fisher on a $2 million bond. Her lawyer, Eric Naiburg, sold her story to movie producers to raise the bond money. Two months later, Fisher pleaded guilty to reduced charges of first-degree aggravated assault.(MORE: Excerpt: 'Getting It Through My Thick Skull')Paul DeMaria/NY Daily News Archive via Getty ImagesAmy Fisher, 17, from Merrick, Long Island is arrested for the attempted murder of Mary Jo Buttafuoco.On Dec. 2, 1992, Fisher was sentenced to five to 15 years and eligible for parole after five years. Authorities had sought to charge Joey Buttafuoco with at least statutory rape but they dropped their case against him at that point.\"You would think that after a huge tragedy like this you would want to maintain a low profile. But, no, that didn't happen,\" Jessie Buttafuoco said.After Fisher was sentenced, Jessie Buttafuoco was ready to get back to a normal life, but that would prove impossible for her and her family. There were three made-for-TV movies released around the case and the family was courted by tabloid TV talk shows.Joey Buttafuoco goes to jailA man claiming to work at Joey Buttafuoco's family auto body shop appeared on Geraldo Rivera's talk show \"Geraldo,\" and claimed that Joey Buttafuoco had admitted to having sex with Fisher when she was 16. The district attorney's office came up with a 19-count indictment against Joey Buttafuoco, including for statutory rape.In November 1993, a year and a half after his wife was nearly killed, Joey Buttafuoco pleaded guilty to one count of statutory rape. He was given six months in jail \u2014 the maximum allowable under his plea agreement -- a $5,000 fine and five years' probation.Jessie Buttafuoco told ABC News that going to jail to see her father was \"pretty surreal.\"\"What sticks out the most now is \u2014 and it makes me kind of sad \u2014 is I drew a lot of pictures. I colored a lot of coloring books so he could post it on his wall. You know, and that's just messed up. That's a messed-up exchange between a father and daughter to have to do,\" she said.(MORE: Amy Fisher Back in the Spotlight with New Sex Tape)ABCMary Jo Buttafuoco speaks with \"20/20\" 27 years after she was shot by Amy Fisher.Joey Buttafuoco was released in March 1994 from the Nassau County Jail after serving four months. Again, Mary Jo and Jessie Buttafuoco said they thought that their lives would return to normal, but Hollywood came calling and Joey Buttafuoco answered.While he was in California, he was arrested for soliciting a vice cop posing as a prostitute, which was a violation of his probation. He landed back in jail.\"He's always getting into mischief. Mischief seems to always get into him,\" Jessie Buttafuoco said. \"Things would calm down for a little bit, and then, you know, Joey would do something. Another shoe would drop.\"By 1996, Mary Jo Buttafuoco said she was depressed and even suicidal after all they had been through, but she said she decided to stay with Joey; she and the two kids moved with him to Los Angeles. Their Long Island home was now a tourist attraction and the family could not go outside without being recognized, Jessie Buttafuoco said.\"My family now is this larger-than-life thing. You can\u2019t be normal anymore so what do you do? You move to Los Angeles and you join the circus,\" she said.Mary Jo Buttafuoco said she didn't want to go with Joey Buttafuoco but she felt she had no choice because of her mental and physical state. While in California, she said, she realized that she had a drug addiction. Dominic Barbara, the family's lawyer, got her into the Betty Ford Center where she got sober.\"Between physically getting off the medication and then the counseling that I got, it made me stronger. It made me come home and realize, 'OK, you know, I've got to try and fix what I can fix. I can't fix him. I can only fix me,'\" she said.In 1998, Fisher was up for parole at Albion State Prison in New York. The district attorney's office had recommended that she not be released on parole. Fisher wrote Mary Jo Buttafuoco a letter asking for forgiveness.Ultimately, Mary Jo Buttafuoco consented to Fisher's being released on parole, which Fisher was granted in May 1999 after nearly seven years in prison.ABC NewsMary Jo Buttafuoco spoke to \"20/20\" 27 years after the fateful shooting that nearly killed her and certainly changed her life forever.Fisher later got married and had children, and seemed to move on with her life. The Buttafuocos, however, were still struggling to get their lives back on track.\"Our lives had become ridiculous. It was nothing normal,\" Mary Jo Buttafuoco said. \"I wasn\u2019t in love with [Joey Buttafuoco] anymore. [He] was this child that just wouldn\u2019t grow up. \u2026 All the reasons that kept me in that marriage were gone. I was sober and our children were adults.\"When Mary Jo and Joey Buttafuoco divorced in 2003, Jessie Buttafuoco said she was devastated by the news.\"It was like a kick to my stomach. I think I got really mad. It's like, after all we've been through, now y'all are giving up?\" she said. \"You know...it's us against the world, and now this is falling apart? So now what?\"'Zero degree of normalcy\u2019 in Buttafuoco homeJessie Buttafuoco said that she and her brother struggled in their new surroundings in California and with the new family dynamic.\"After the shooting, there was zero degree of normalcy. That's all I wanted. All I wanted was to be normal but it was a rough, rough time,\" she said.Jessie Buttafuoco said she began using cocaine, became an alcoholic and also suffered from eating disorders.\"A lot of it was suppressed. It was all of this hiding and everything's fine and I'm terrific. And deep down, things weren't terrific and it all stemmed from her mom getting shot and seeing how people portrayed her mom and dad,\" said Eileen, Mary Jo Buttafuoco\u2019s sister.(MORE: 12/1/1992: Amy Fisher Sentenced to Prison)ABC\"I met Amy through a friend of mine, Chris Drellos,\" Steven Sleeman told \"20/20.\" \"We both worked in the restaurant together, and he introduced me to this girl Amy.\"Still, Mary Jo and Joey Buttafuoco needed money. So, when another opportunity to appear on TV -- and get paid -- came knocking, Joey Buttafuoco persuaded Mary Jo Buttafuoco to join him. They appeared on \"Entertainment Tonight\" and \"Insider\" across from Fisher as part of a reunion special in May 2006. Joey Buttafuoco and Fisher also appeared on other TV specials.Jessie Buttafuoco said she didn\u2019t know about any televised reunion until it had aired.  Neither she nor her brother participated in the TV programs.\"I didn't talk to my father for a solid year after that. ... It was a disaster. It was disgusting. \u2026 I was like, 'Listen, Dad. My life is hard enough already. I\u2019m in college. I\u2019m trying to figure out who I am. I\u2019m in the height of my drinking, drugging and eating disorders,'\" she said. \"I just remember being so pissed and just being like, 'You are gallivanting around the streets of New York with the woman who tried to murder my mother?\u2019 This is not a joke. This is not a paycheck I want. No, no, this is not right. It's f----- up. This should not be happening.\"In 2005, Mary Jo Buttafuoco appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" She still suffered from facial paralysis and ear damage from the gunshot. Plastic surgeon Dr. Babek Azizzadeh, whose wife had tuned in that day, told him about her case. With the help of the \"Oprah\" show, the doctor met with Buttafuoco and said he could help her.\"The crux of the surgery was to really even out her face, suspend the drooping \u2014 corner of her mouth \u2014 to help her not have drooling as much and difficulty in her speech. And we proceeded in doing that,\" Azizzadeh told ABC News.Her post-surgery results were revealed on a later episode of \"Oprah.\"\"The bandages came off and I looked in the mirror and I looked like the way I used to look. \u2026 I started to cry and my kids started to cry,\" Mary Jo Buttafuoco said. \"It was just terrific, and I was just so happy and so grateful.\"Jessie Buttafuoco gives backJoey Buttafuoco is now working on a movie about his early life.Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images, FILEAmy Fisher guest DJ's at club Retox, Jan. 4, 2008, in New York City.\"I'm not that kinda guy that's gonna sit here and blame anything on anything and how I got here.

I made some good choices and I made some bad choices,\" he said.Fisher has since divorced her husband and lives with her children in Florida. She appeared in a few pornographic movies and works as a \"cam girl.\"Jessie Buttafuoco, 36, told ABC News that she was now on \"pretty good terms\" with her father.\"He's in a growth phase where he's in therapy and he's healing,\" she said. \"I'm proud of my dad for telling his story, and I hope he\u2019s not using it to justify why he made so many poor decisions. \u2026 I like this new man he's becoming.

They testified in favor of the bill, which is against the death penalty, not against the bill.A corrected version of the story is below:New Hampshire poised to repeal death penaltyThe New Hampshire Senate has voted to repeal the state's death penalty, sending the bill to Republican Gov. Chris SununuBy HOLLY RAMERAssociated PressCONCORD, N.H. (AP) \u2014 New Hampshire is on track to become the next state without the death penalty now that both the House and Senate have voted with veto-proof majorities to repeal its capital punishment law.Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed a death penalty repeal bill last June, and the Senate lacked the votes to override it in September. But momentum grew after Democrats won control of both the House and Senate in November, and an identical bill has passed both chambers with more than the necessary two-thirds majority needed to override Sununu's planned veto. The House vote 279-88 last month, while the Senate vote Thursday was 17-6, with five Republicans joining 12 Democrats voting in favor of repeal.\"State-sanctioned killing is cruel, ineffective and inherently flawed,\" said Sen. Martha Hennessey, D-Hanover. \"It is time to abolish the death penalty in New Hampshire. Now is the time.\"Thirty states allow capital punishment, though in four of them, governors have issued moratoria on the death penalty, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Twenty states have abolished or overturned it.New Hampshire hasn't executed anyone since 1939. The repeal bill would not apply retroactively to Michael Addison, who killed Manchester Police Officer Michael Briggs in 2006 and is the state's only death row inmate. But supporters of capital punishment argue that courts will see it differently.\"The day that this passes and is signed into law, Mr. Addison's sentence will be converted to life in prison,\" said Sen. Sharon Carson, R-Londonderry. \"Please talk to Mrs. Briggs about that, the wife of the police officer that was murdered in the line of duty. She will not be able to speak to her husband again, whereas Mr. Addison will be able to talk to his family and have them come up to visit him.\"Laura Briggs has largely stayed out of the debate over the death penalty bill over the years, but she spoke last month against a repeal in part because her son's now working in law enforcement.\"The death penalty is about protecting society from evil. It's not about an eye-for-an-eye or revenge. It's about protecting our society from evil people that do evil things,\" she said at the time.Carson echoed those comments Thursday.\"We're not talking about getting revenge or soothing the families soul or anything else like that,\" she said. \"This is about justice nothing more, nothing less.\"Other relatives of murder victims, however, testified in favor of the bill, as did retired prosecutors, clergy and former death row inmates who were exonerated and released. Sen. Harold French, R-Franklin, said their comments helped solidify his previous opposition to the death penalty, which had been based mainly on the cost associated with lengthy appeals in capital murder cases.\"As I get older I realized for a fact we're actually all on death row and it's just a matter of time before our names get called. When my name gets called, I'm going to go before the Lord with a huge basket full of regrets and misdeeds, just like you will. But I tell you what won't be in that basket of misdeeds,\" he said. \"What won't be in there is that I did not turn a deaf ear to those who came and took the time to speak to us to get rid of the death penalty.\"Sen. Ruth Ward, R-Stoddard, kept her remarks short, explaining simply that her father was killed when she was 7 years old.\"He never saw us grow up. My mother forgave whoever it was, and I will vote in favor of this bill,\" she said.A spokesman for Sununu reiterated the governor's opposition to the bill Thursday.\"Gov. Sununu continues to stand with crime victims, members of the law enforcement community and advocates for justice in opposing a repeal of the death penalty,\" Ben Vihstadt said in a written statement."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/tennessee-prepares-execute-blind-death-row-inmate-67442792", "headline": "Tennessee prepares to execute blind death row inmate - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "December 2, 2019, 8:28 PM", "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The execution of a blind man in Tennessee this week would mark only the second time in recent decades that a person without vision has been put to death in the U.S., the death row inmate\u2019s lawyers say.Lee Hall, 53, is scheduled to be electrocuted Thursday in a state that has accelerated the pace of its executions over the past year.Hall had his sight when he entered death row nearly three decades ago, but attorneys for the condemned prisoner say he\u2019s since become functionally blind due to improperly treated glaucoma.Hall\u2019s attorneys say only one other blind prisoner has been executed since the death penalty was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976.His case illustrates a trend in capital punishment: The longer inmates across the country wait to die, the more medical ailments they are likely to have by the time they enter the execution chamber.\u201cDeath row is not \u2014 and is not intended to be \u2014 a nurturing environment, and it is unfortunately an environment that is extremely, physically and mentally debilitating,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. The stress of living under a death penalty \u201chas both physical and psychological consequences,\u201d he said.Hall, formerly known as Leroy Hall Jr., has been on death row since he was convicted for the 1991 killing of his estranged girlfriend Traci Crozier. According to court documents, Hall threw a lit jug of gasoline into a car while Crozier was in the front seat trying to leave him. As a result, Crozier was burned on more than 90% of her body and died the next day.In 2010, Hall was diagnosed with \u201cchronic angle closure glaucoma.\u201d Hall\u2019s eyesight has continued to decline since then, his attorneys explained in court documents. They say the Department of Correction has failed to comply with medical recommendations to prevent further damage.A spokeswoman for the department did not immediately return a request for comment.\u201cLee Hall is blind and vulnerable. If confined to prison for the remainder of natural life, Mr. Hall bears no practical risk of harm to anyone,\u201d Hall\u2019s attorneys wrote in 2018. \u201cThe spectacle \u2014 guiding him to the gurney \u2014 would \u2018offend humanity.\u2019\u201dTo date, the U.S. Supreme Court has neither set an upper age limit for executions nor created an exception for a physical infirmity.The high court has, however, said the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment means that people who are insane, delusional or psychotic cannot be executed.Yet that definition of \u201cinsane\u201d is narrowly defined and as a result, most people with severe mental illness are often excluded.\u201cWhile blindness is a physical disability that may make an execution seem crueler and more inhumane, it doesn\u2019t go to the question of competency of whether he may be executed,\u201d Dunham said.According to Hall\u2019s attorneys, the last blind person executed was Clarence Ray Allen, who died via lethal injection in 2006 in California. Along with being unable to see, Allen was also a wheelchair-user and nearly deaf.At the time, Allen, 76, was the oldest and most infirm inmate prisoner to be executed in the United States. And like Hall, Allen had been on death row for decades, where many of his infirmities developed while behind bars.Last month, Hall announced he had decided to die by the electric chair rather than by lethal injection. Since Tennessee resumed executions in August 2018, three of the five prisoners put to death have chosen the electric chair.In Tennessee, the state's primary execution method is lethal injection, but inmates who were convicted of crimes before January 1999 can choose electrocution.With just days left before Thursday\u2019s planned execution, Hall\u2019s attorneys are asking Gov. Bill Lee for a reprieve to allow more time to consider questions about the possible bias of a juror who helped deliver the original death sentence.Lee is reviewing the request. He has previously sidestepped questions about Tennessee executing a blind person, saying he did not know enough details about the case."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/cow-cuddling-flying-miniature-horses-part-rapidly-expanding/story?id=67473964", "headline": "Cow cuddling, flying with miniature horses are part of rapidly ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "December 4, 2019, 12:50 AM", "text": "Abrea Hensley and her miniature service horse, Flirty, are quite the sight.

Last year a woman was banned from a flight after she tried to bring her emotional support peacock on the plane, and many airlines have weight and breed restrictions.\"Unfortunately, I think the influx of all kinds of animals on planes and public transportation in general has possibly swung the pendulum a little bit too far,\" said Ashton. \"Just because a physician or health professional can certify a person as potentially benefiting from an animal is very different than going through the often very rigorous steps, selection and training process that many people who have service animals or support animals have to go through.\"In upstate New York, a different kind of emotional support animal is providing moving experiences for many visitors to Mountain Horse Farm, home to Bella and Bonnie the comfort cows.ABCIn upstate New York, a different kind of emotional support animal is providing moo-ving experiences for many visitors to Mountain Horse Farm, home to Bella and Bonnie the comfort cows.Suzanne Vullers and her husband, Rudi, own and operate Mountain Horse Farm, in Naples, New York, which doubles as a bed and breakfast and spa.

Marvin Hunter said Friday after Jason Van Dyke was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison that the case sends a \"strong message\" to other police officers that they can and will go to jail if they're caught lying or breaking the law.However, Hunter says Van Dyke \"clearly committed murder\" and that footage of him shooting McDonald 16 times has been shown all over the world. He says anyone with a conscience knows it was murder and that legal changes are needed.Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each shot.\u2014\u2014\u20146:50 p.m.Jason Van Dyke's lead attorney says the former Chicago police officer \"truly felt great\" and \"was happy\" with the nearly seven-year prison sentence he received for fatally shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald.Attorney Dan Herbert said after Friday's hearing that, \"We're happy that he does have the ability to see those two beautiful girls ... and his wife, he's gonna see the better part of their lives.\"Lawyers for both sides agreed that if Van Dyke behaves in prison, he could get out after serving half of his 81-month sentence, which would be less than three-and-a-half years.In Illinois, judges are typically required to sentence defendants for the most serious crime for which they're convicted.Judge Vincent Gaughan's decision to sentence Van Dyke on the second-degree murder charge instead of the 16 counts of aggravated battery was a huge break for the former officer. Had he been sentenced for the battery counts, Van Dyke would have had to serve 85 percent of his sentence.\u2014\u2014\u20146:20 p.m.The prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Chicago police officer who killed black teenager Laquan McDonald says he can live with the nearly seven-year prison sentence the defendant received.Special Prosecutor Joseph McMahon said after Jason Van Dyke's sentencing hearing Friday that \"Our goal was to find the truth, present the truth and ask for justice. ... It was not revenge.\"He says there was never a moment when he felt Judge Vincent Gaughan \"wasn't absolutely following and considering heartfelt testimonies.\"He also says it was a \"historical case\" and that he believes the system worked.Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time he shot McDonald.\u2014\u2014\u20146:05 p.m.A relative of Laquan McDonald says he doesn't think the sentence for the police officer who killed the black teen is sufficient.The Rev. Marvin Hunter said Friday that Judge Vincent Gaughan's         sentence of six years and nine months in prison doesn't do his great-nephew justice.Activist William Calloway said 81 months \"is a slap in the face to us and a slap on the wrist for him,\" referring to the defendant, former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke.Van Dyke barely moved when the judge sentenced him. A jury convicted him in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time he shot McDonald in 2014.Police dashcam video of the confrontation showed Van Dyke firing round after round into the teenager even after he had crumpled to the ground and was barely moving.\u2014\u2014\u20145:40 p.m.Former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke didn't react when he was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison for the 2014 killing of black teen Laquan McDonald.Van Dyke sat still and blinked as Judge Vincent Gaughan sentenced him Friday to six years and nine months behind bars. His wife, Tiffany Van Dyke, also didn't react, but others in her row in the courtroom gallery showed relief.The couple's older daughter started crying and said \"I want him home.\"Before handing down his sentence, Gaughan said the shooting had affected both McDonald's and Van Dyke's families and that he assumed that \"100 percent of people will be disappointed\" with his decision.\u2014\u2014\u20145:30 p.m.A judge has sentenced former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke to nearly seven years in prison in the 2014 shooting death of black teenager Laquan McDonald.Judge Vincent Gaughan's         sentence of six years and nine months in prison Friday came a day after         another judge acquitted three other officers of trying to cover up the shooting to protect Van Dyke.Van Dyke shot McDonald 16 times, including after the 17-year-old was on the ground and barely moving. A jury convicted him in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each shot.The case went largely unnoticed until the city was forced to release police dashcam video 13 months after it happened. The video sparked large protests and led to the ouster of Chicago's top police official and some department reforms.The 40-year-old Van Dyke is believed to be the first Chicago officer convicted in a fatal on-duty shooting of an African-American.\u2014\u2014\u20145:15 p.m.Former Chicago police office Jason Van Dyke has told the judge who will sentence him that \"The last thing I wanted to do was shoot Laquan McDonald\"Van Dyke spoke briefly Friday after more than a dozen character witnesses testified and after his attorneys and prosecutors summed up their cases.The former officer didn't testify before a jury convicted him in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time he shot the black teenager.Van Dyke said Friday that he has \"prayed daily for the soul of Laquan McDonald.\"\u2014\u2014\u20145 p.m.The prosecutor in the trial of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke says a sentence of between 18 and 20 years would be appropriate for the killing of black teenager Laquan McDonald.Special Prosecutor Joseph McMahon said Friday while summing up the state's case that Van Dyke's 2014 shooting of the 17-year-old has been \"devastating\" not just for Chicago but for the entire nation because it has further deepened the public's distrust in the police.A jury convicted Van Dyke of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time the officer shot McDonald.Defense attorney Darren O'Brien asked the judge to sentence Van Dyke to probation. He said the murder charge allows for probation and that this case \"screams out\" for such a sentence.\u2014\u2014\u20144:45 p.m.Attorneys are about to make their closing statements at the sentencing hearing for former Chicago police officer Jason McDonald in the 2014 killing of black teenager Laquan McDonald.Prosecutors and defense lawyers called more than a dozen character witnesses during Friday's hearing, including McDonald's great-uncle and Van Dyke's wife and 17-year-old daughter.Among the witnesses called by prosecutors were several black men who recounted run-ins with Van Dyke during traffic stops.The former officer's family members said he's a good father and husband who isn't hate-filled or racist.Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time he shot McDonald.\u2014\u2014\u20144:20 p.m.Jason Van Dyke's wife says her life has been \"a nightmare\" and has been turned upside down since the former Chicago police officer's murder conviction in the 2014 fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald.Tiffany Van Dyke said Friday at her husband's sentencing hearing that he is her \"everything,\" her \"other half\" and her \"heart.\"She echoed other family members who testified that her husband isn't racist or full of hatred.Fighting through tears, she said her two daughters don't eat or sleep and get bullied at school by kids who tell them \"their father is a murderer.\"Jason Van Dyke wiped his nose and eyes with a tissue as his wife testified. He was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time he shot McDonald.\u2014\u2014\u20144 p.m.Jason Van Dyke's family members are trying to humanize the former Chicago police officer during his sentencing hearing for the 2014 fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald, saying he's a good father and husband who goes out of his way to help and who isn't racist.Van Dyke's sister, Heidi Kauffunger, told the court Friday that her brother has been abandoned by family and friends since he was charged. She says he was even contacted by someone who said Van Dyke had mistakenly been invited to a wedding and that the family didn't want him there because \"it would take attention away\" from the bride and groom.Kauffunger begged the court for mercy and said if her brother goes to prison the family \"will lose everything.\" She says Van Dyke's two daughters have been bullied and that the older one even had the words \"16 shots\" written on her school desk.His father, Owen Van Dyke, said Jason was a good student and is a good son.Jason Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time he shot McDonald.\u2014\u2014\u20143:40 p.m.Jason Van Dyke's brother-in-law says the former Chicago police officer is a \"gentle giant\" and isn't the \"monster\" or \"racist cop\" that he's been portrayed as by the media.Keith Thompson said Friday at Van Dyke's sentencing hearing that Van Dyke has always treated people fairly. Thompson, who is black and whose wife is the sister of Van Dyke's wife, said he has never seen anything to indicate that Van Dyke is racist in the 13 years he's known him.He said it will be very difficult for the family moving forward because Van Dyke is a convicted felon.Van Dyke, who is white, was convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated battery in the 2014 fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald.\u2014\u2014\u20143:20 p.m.One of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke's daughters spoke during his sentencing hearing and blamed the media for shaming \"police officers for doing their jobs.\"Kaylee Van Dyke told the court Friday that she wrote a paper for her high school civics class about \"the harsh reality\" of police work.The 17-year-old said she knows the positives of the job, but that she thinks the media \"twists events, making people create negative thoughts.\"She said police officers don't care about people's color, \"they care about your safety.\" She also said she regrets all the times she didn't hug her father.Jason Van Dyke, who is white, was convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated battery in the 2014 shooting death of black teenager Laquan McDonald.\u2014\u2014\u20142:45 p.m.A prosecution witness at the sentencing of the Chicago police officer who killed black teen Laquan McDonald wasn't able to identify the officer in the courtroom, so he wasn't allowed to keep testifying.Alberto Luces was one of several men who testified Friday about run-ins they had with Officer Jason Van Dyke during traffic stops. Luces, who is deaf, said through a sign language interpreter that he was pulled over by two officers, one black and one white. But when asked to identify the white officer in the courtroom, Luces said he couldn't because he didn't have his glasses.The judge allowed Luces to walk around the courtroom, but he still wasn't able to pick out Van Dyke even though the former officer was wearing a bright yellow jail jumpsuit. Van Dyke has grown a bushy beard and mustache since he was convicted in October of second-degree murder and aggravated battery.\u2014\u2014\u20142 p.m.A relative of Laquan McDonald has been allowed to read a victim impact statement from the slain black teen's perspective, saying Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke killed his grandnephew without provocation.Reading from a prepared text in the first person as Laquan McDonald on Friday, the Rev. Marvin Hunter said, \"I am a 17-year-old boy\" and \"I am unable to speak in my own voice\" because officer Jason Van Dyke \"thought he would become judge, jury and executioner.He added, \"My death has brought inconsolable pain to my mother and my sister ... my family. ... He has not just destroyed my life but the life of his wife and children.\"In asking for a stiff sentence for Van Dyke, he said: \"Why should this person who ended my life forever ... who has never asked for forgiveness ... be free when I am dead for forever?\"Van Dyke was convicted in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time he shot McDonald.\u2014\u2014\u201412:40 p.m.Several black men called to testify during the sentencing hearing of the Chicago police officer who killed black teenager Laquan McDonald have described their own run-ins with the officer during traffic stops.Vidale Joy told the court Friday that Jason Van Dyke used a racial slur and put a gun to his head during a 2005 stop. He said Van Dyke \"looked infuriated\" and seemed \"out of his mind.\" Under cross examination, Joy conceded that he didn't allege in his first accounts of the traffic stop that Van Dyke had used a slur.Witness Ed Nance wept as he testified that he hasn't been the same since a 2007 stop. He says Van Dyke pulled him by the arms to the squad car while he was handcuffed and that he has undergone three surgeries to his shoulders as a result. He also says he has PTSD from the incident.\u2014\u2014\u201411:50 a.m.Attorneys at the sentencing hearing for the Chicago police officer who killed black teenager Laquan McDonald have made their arguments about which charge he faces is the most serious.Judge Vincent Gaughan's decision on whether Jason Van Dyke's second-degree murder or aggravated battery conviction is more serious will help determine the severity of the sentence.In Illinois, judges are typically required to sentence defendants for the most serious crime for which they're convicted.The defense wants Van Dyke to be sentenced for the second-degree murder charge, partly because it carries a shorter mandatory minimum prison term of four years.Prosecutors want the judge to focus on the 16 aggravated battery counts. Each carries a mandatory minimum prison term of six years and sentences for each count may have to be served consecutively instead of concurrently.\u2014\u2014\u20149:50 a.m.The sentencing hearing has begun for the Chicago police officer who killed black teenager Laquan McDonald in 2014.Jason Van Dyke, who was booted from the force once he was convicted, was led into court Friday in a yellow jail jumpsuit. His wife and two daughters are at the hearing.Judge Vincent Gaughan says he'll first hear legal arguments about which is the more serious charge against Van Dyke, who was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery \u2014 one for each time he shot McDonald. If he decides the murder charge is more serious, that could lead to a lesser sentence under a complex sentencing equation.After that legal issue is settled, attorneys will call witnesses to make the case for aggravating or mitigating circumstances before making their final arguments.\u2014\u2014\u201412:05 a.m.A judge rejected allegations that the shocking video of Laquan McDonald's death proved that police officers staged a cover-up in the fatal shooting of the black teen.Now another judge must decide how long the officer who pulled the trigger spends behind bars. Jason Van Dyke was convicted in October of second-degree murder and aggravated battery. He will likely be given prison time when he's sentenced Friday.But critics of the police department who cheered Van Dyke's conviction are worried after a judge on Thursday acquitted three officers accused of trying to conceal what happened to protect their colleague. He was the first Chicago officer found guilty in an on-duty shooting in a half century and probably the first ever in the shooting of an African-American.\u2014\u2014\u2014For more stories about this case, visit         AP's Laquan McDonald hub"}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/smartphone-flashlight-leads-rescuers-60-year-woman-lost/story?id=68000855", "headline": "Rescue crew finds missing hiker with unlikely piece of technology ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "December 31, 2019, 3:57 PM", "text": "A Florida sheriff's office helped track down and rescue a woman who went missing while hiking thanks to an unlikely hero -- her iPhone flashlight.The Hillsboro County Sheriff's Office shared the news along with a night vision, black and white video, of the moment their Aviation Unit located the hiker who had called 911 on Dec. 29 when she became lost at a nature park in Thonotosassa.(MORE: Deaf hiker who fell down snowy mountain credits husky for saving her life)The HCSO Aviation Unit posted a video on Facebook of their search and rescue through the heavily wooded area in Flatwoods Wilderness Park.Hillsborough County Sheriff's OfficeThe Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office Aviation Unit was able to locate a female hiker who went missing at a nature park in Thonotosassa, Fla., Dec. 29, 2019.\"Luckily, they were able to spot her lighted cell phone,\" authorities said in the post. \"Deputies were able to use coordinates from the helicopter to provide the Communications Center with a location and direct a park ranger driving an ATV to the hiker.

Her sister invited her to a Stanford fraternity party, where she said she enjoyed herself and drank. The last thing she remembered was taking a sip of lukewarm beer and handing it to her sister, she said.The assault was stopped by two men who noticed that Miller, partially naked and lying by a dumpster, wasn't moving. Turner, a 19-year-old Stanford swimmer, fled, but the witnesses tackled him and held him until police arrived, authorities said.Miller said her next memory was waking up in the hospital.(MORE: Victim in Brock Turner Stanford sexual assault case goes public with her name and memoir)There, she was given pamphlets on assault recovery, photographed naked to record each bruise, interviewed by a detective about every detail of her night and underwent a rape kit exam.While the experience was traumatic, she recalled that the nurses were professional and motherly, without a hint of pity in their voices.Preston Gannaway/The New York Times/ReduxChanel Miller, formerly known as \"Emily Doe,\" the name that identified her during the 2016 trial of Brock Turner, the Stanford University student charged with sexually assaulting her, at her home in San Francisco, Sept. 11, 2019.\"I didn't like the chilled metal, the stiff heads of cotton, the pills, syringes, my thighs laid open,\" she wrote. \"But their voices soothed me, as if we were here to catch up on life, handing me a cup of neon pink pills like it was a mimosa.\"Her worried sister picked her up and they returned home. Miller, so confused by this \"alternate reality,\" in which she didn't know exactly what happened, didn't tell her parents or boyfriend -- and instead return to work and daily life, she wrote.Detectives told her she was the victim of a suspected sex assault but also said it wasn't clear exactly what happened. Later that was revealed to be digital penetration.That morning at the hospital she was given some papers to sign. \"I stopped when I saw the words Rape Victim in bold at the top of one sheet,\" she wrote. \"I paused. No, I do not consent to being a rape victim. If signed on the line, would I become one?

Miller said the prosecutor seemed relieved to meet him -- a sweet, Ivy League graduate student.\"It bothered me that having a boyfriend and being assaulted should be related, as if I, alone, was not enough,\" she wrote. \"At the hospital it had never occurred to me that it was important I was dating someone; I had only been thinking of me and my body. It should have been enough to say, 'I did not want a stranger touching my body.' It felt strange to say 'I have a boyfriend which is why I did not want Brock touching my body.'\"Miller said she felt her \"character was just as much on trial\" as Turner's; she agonized over what to wear to court and how to act, insecure about appearing as an imperfect victim who drank and had occasionally blacked out.Miller said she learned at one point that evidence photos of her naked body were shown in court -- \"for the judge and Brock and his brother and his father and every reporter and stranger in that room to see.\"\"While this was happening, I must have been down the hall, smoothing out my blouse... trying to look presentable,\" she wrote. \"The humiliation, I feel now, for walking in with a smile while everyone in there had already seen me naked.\"(MORE: Ex-Stanford swimmer Brock Turner registers as sex offender in Ohio)The conviction and sentenceTurner, who maintained the encounter was consensual, was found guilty in 2016 of three felony charges: assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated/unconscious person, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person.Gary Reyes/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty ImagesBrock Turner, 19, appears in the Palo Alto branch of Santa Clara County Superior Court court, March 30, 2015, for a status hearing on charges that he allegedly raped an unconscious woman outside a campus fraternity party in January.After the conviction, Miller, who was still living with her parents, broke down.\"During trial I had to shut down to make it through,\" she explained in her book. \"Now came the release, my body helpless against the anguish.\"(MORE: Sister of Brock Turner's victim writes scathing letter to ex-Stanford swimmer)Turner, a former Stanford swimmer, was facing up to 14 years in prison, but prosecutors asked for six years.Turner's dad made a controversial plea for leniency at the time, telling the judge \"20 minutes of action\" should not define his son's life.\"In swimming, one one-hundredth of a second is the different between victory and loss,\" Miller wrote. \"Yet he wanted to write off twenty minutes as insignificant... who counts the doctors visits, the hours spent wringing my hands in therapy, the nights spent lying awake?\"Judge Aaron Persky sentenced Turner to six months in jail and three years probation, citing the \"severe impact\" that prison would have on the former college athlete.

Persky weeks before the vote called the move a \"step too far,\" he said, according to Palo Alto Online. \"It really runs the risk of putting judges out there in the political arena and making them subject to that type of political pressure,\" he added.Eric Risberg/APActivists from UltraViolet, a national women's advocacy organization, attempt to deliver over one million signatures to the California Commission on Judicial Performance calling for the removal of Judge Aaron Persky from the bench, June 10, 2016, in San Francisco.Eric Risberg/AP, FILEActivists from UltraViolet, a national women's advocacy organization, hold up signs before delivering over one million signatures to the California Commission on Judicial Performance calling for the removal of Judge Aaron Persky from the bench at a rally in San Francisco, June 10, 2016.Turner appealed his conviction, but the appeal was denied in 2018. His appeals attorney, Eric Multhaup, did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.Meanwhile, Miller and her boyfriend moved to San Francisco, but she couldn't sleep alone, terrified of being unconscious and vulnerable -- the same state she was in during the assault.When the sun would go down, she'd turn on all the lights, stack chairs in front of the door and arm herself with pepper spray and scissors.\"In the past few years, I have not slept alone for longer than three days,\" she wrote. \"When I find out female friends live in studio apartments I'm in shock.

Freelon is best known for designing the National Museum of African American History and Culture and other major museum projects \u2014 among them Atlanta\u2019s National Center for Civil Rights, San Francisco\u2019s Museum of the African Diaspora, and Charlotte\u2019s Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Arts + Culture. But on this day, we were admiring, of all things, a bus station.\u201cIf you go around the country and visit bus stations, they\u2019re usually seedy and dirty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have to be.\u201dAnd the Durham Station Transportation Center, which Freelon designed, wouldn\u2019t be out of place on the gilded campuses of Apple or Google. The center, which opened in 2008, has a glass exterior topped by a sleek metal roof sloped like a beret, covering an airy, minimalist interior lounge and ticketing area.\u201cIn my career, I\u2019ve learned that if you build something beautiful, people will respect it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice there\u2019s no graffiti. Now, I don\u2019t think everyone going to catch a bus looks around and says, \u2018Wow, this is a beautiful building.\u2019 But I think they soak in the ambiance, and I\u2019m happy about that.\u201dThe paradox of architecture is that it\u2019s all around us, and yet, for many people, the profession remains esoteric. \u201cIf you have a talented young African-American, their family will likely know a lawyer, doctor, teacher or a clergyman, but not an architect,\u201d Freelon said. \u201cMy parents, who were both college-educated, didn\u2019t know an architect of any color, and certainly not a black one.\u201cDiversity is a huge problem in our profession. The profession is small \u2014 there are only 110,000 licensed architects in the United States, compared to 1 million attorneys and 800,000 physicians. And only 2 percent of architects are African-Americans, a lower ratio than with lawyers and doctors.\u201dFreelon, 65, has attempted to change that on several fronts: through his hiring practices, visits to predominantly minority schools to speak about his work, and the establishment in 2016 of the Freelon Fellowship, which provides financial aid so a student from an underrepresented group can attend the Harvard Graduate School of Design. And since he founded his eponymous firm in 1990, much of his work has been focused on designing libraries and other academic buildings for historically black colleges and universities and cultural projects in traditionally black neighborhoods.Currently he\u2019s involved with a major expansion of the Motown Museum in Detroit, a mile-long open-air museum along Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles and the North Carolina Freedom Park in downtown Raleigh. \u201cHe\u2019s designed nearly every major museum or public space dedicated to black culture in the United States,\u201d Fast Company magazine observed when it named Freelon its Architect of the Year in 2017.\u201cOf course, you don\u2019t just wake up one morning and the Smithsonian wants you to build a museum,\u201d Freelon said. \u201cThere\u2019s 30 years of work that leads up to that.\u201dJahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILEThe National Museum of African American History and Culture, NMAAHC, July 6, 2016, prior to the September 2016 opening in Washington, D.C. The Corona is the signature feature of the building, consisting of 3,600 bronze-colored cast-aluminum panels.Before he had ever met an architect, Freelon had decided to become one. He grew up in Philadelphia, where his mother was a school administrator and his father was a salesperson for Cordis, a Miami-based medical device manufacturer. Freelon attended Central High School, an academically rigorous, predominantly white, all-boys magnet school, which also produced the famed architect Louis Kahn. Citing the influence of his grandfather, Allan Randall Freelon Sr., a Harlem Renaissance-era painter, Freelon said he was drawn to classes in the visual arts, as well as drafting and design. He also took inspiration from his strolls through the city, visiting the Franklin Institute and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \u201cOnly later,\u201d Freelon said, \u201cdid I learn that a black architect, Julian Abele, helped design the museum,\u201d including the iconic steps featured in Rocky.Freelon had his mind set on attending a historically black college or university (HBCU) and enrolled at Hampton University in Virginia. \u201cIt was the height of the civil rights movement and Black Power, and I had an Afro and was very socially engaged,\u201d he said.Freelon plowed through the curriculum. \u201cHe was an excellent student, meticulous and curious,\u201d said John Spencer, chairman of the architecture department, whom Freelon credits as his first mentor. Believing he would be more challenged at a larger university, Freelon transferred to North Carolina State, although he was anxious about moving deeper into the South. \u201cWhen my father used to attend his company\u2019s annual conference in Miami in the \u201960s, he couldn\u2019t stay in the downtown hotels and would stay in the black neighborhood of Overtown,\u201d Freelon recalled. But a visit to Raleigh reassured him.\u201cAt N.C. State, Phil and I were two of only a handful of black students at the College of Design, and there weren\u2019t any black professors in our discipline,\u201d recalled Percy Hooper, now an associate professor of industrial design at N.C. State. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel segregated from the white students, but we ended up spending a lot of time together, supporting one another.\u201d The coursework was demanding, and there wasn\u2019t a lot of downtime. To unwind, the friends would ride their bikes or, more ill-advisedly, toss around ninja stars.During summers, Freelon worked for a professor at the Durham-based architectural firm of John D. Latimer and Associates and continued at the firm\u2019s Taunton, Massachusetts, office while pursuing a master\u2019s degree at MIT, which he completed in 1977. He worked briefly for a large firm, 3/D International in Houston, before returning to Durham to join O\u2019Brien Atkins Associates, where he soon became the firm\u2019s youngest partner.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images, FILESteel and glass create patterns and reflections inside the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National, Mall Sept. 14, 2016 in Washington, D.C.Freelon helped design schools, churches and other buildings around the state. \u201cAs a young architect, you\u2019re not a specialist and you tackle a wide variety of projects.\u201d A significant step in his career, he said, was being tapped as lead designer for Terminal 2 of the Raleigh-Durham International Airport. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s since been demolished and rebuilt,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cAt this stage of my career, there are a few buildings that I\u2019ve designed that have been torn down.\u201d (He later designed an award-winning parking garage at the airport, as well as the airport\u2019s general aviation building.)In 1989, Freelon received a fellowship to study independently for a year at Harvard. The next year, he left O\u2019Brien Atkins to launch his own firm, the Freelon Group. It began as a one-man shop and grew to more than 50 employees, about 40 percent of whom are women and 30 percent people of color.\u201cWhen I decided to start my own practice, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do and not do,\u201d Freelon said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to design prisons, strip malls or casinos. The work that excited me were schools, libraries and similar projects that positively impacted the community.\u201d Freelon also said he had little interest in upscale residential projects, the multimillion-dollar homes that fill the pages of Dwell and Architectural Digest, the ubiquitous coffee table magazines of the aspiring bourgeoisie. \u201cThe only home I\u2019ve ever built is my own,\u201d he said.One afternoon, I joined Freelon and his wife, Nnenna, at their suburban home, a 15-minute drive from downtown Durham. The modern, two-story structure with a matching separate studio space features a warm combination of concrete, steel, glass and laminate siding. The sloped lot abuts a pond and runs the length of a football field. There\u2019s a long path from the house to a fire pit and a steel animal sculpture that the Freelons named Kareem Abdul-Giraffe.Inside, the New Standard Quintet, a Chicago jazz group, played on the stereo while the couple\u2019s dog, Count Basie, perched by the couch. Earlier, Freelon had told me how he met his wife. Nnenna, a Massachusetts native, was finishing her undergraduate degree at Simmons University in Boston. She was on a visit to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where she was considering pursuing a graduate degree in health care administration. A mutual friend introduced them. \u201cWe met on our friend\u2019s front porch, and for me it really was love at first sight,\u201d Phil Freelon said. It was a swift courtship. With only her undergraduate thesis to complete, Nnenna moved to North Carolina, they got married and she quickly became pregnant. She put graduate school on hold and eventually turned to her first love, jazz singing, and is now a six-time Grammy Award nominee.\u201cPhil is one of those lucky people who always knew what he wanted to do,\u201d Nnenna Freelon said. \u201cFor most of us, it\u2019s more circuitous. I was blessed to have a husband who was passionate about what he did and wanted me to find what I was passionate about.\u201dFor a globe-trotting professional singer and star architect, Durham isn\u2019t an obvious home base. Why not New York, Los Angeles or Chicago? \u201cWhen you have kids, your life changes,\u201d Phil Freelon said. \u201cWe figured we could live here and get in an airplane and go where we needed to go. I\u2019m a huge family guy, and I love being a father. That was most important.\u201d The Freelons have three children, who all live nearby. Deen Freelon, the oldest, is a tenured professor at the UNC School of Media and Journalism. Maya Freelon Asante is a visual artist. And Pierce Freelon, the youngest, is an activist and former Durham mayoral candidate who runs Blackspace, an after-school entrepreneurship and social media program for disadvantaged youths.\u201cIt\u2019s been impressive what Phil has done here,\u201d said Kevin Montgomery, the African-American president of O\u2019Brien Atkins whom Freelon recruited to that firm in 1988. \u201cHe was able to develop a firm in a midsize market that has global recognition and can compete with much larger firms in places like New York and Chicago.\u201dThat proved to be the case with the Smithsonian museum, a project, Freelon said, that was more than a decade in the making. A couple of years after his Museum of the African Diaspora opened in 2005 in San Francisco, Freelon teamed up with New York\u2019s Max Bond to win a contract from the Smithsonian to complete the planning and pre-design work for the African-American museum on the National Mall. A year later, the Smithsonian announced an international design competition, and Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye approached Freelon and Bond about joining forces.\u201cDavid is the highest-profile architect of African descent in the world, and we had our eyes out for what he was going to do for the competition,\u201d Freelon said. \u201cWe met and determined we had similar approaches and values, so the team was expanded.\u201d They also added another firm, Washington-based SmithGroup, which had previously done work for the Smithsonian. More than 60 groups, representing firms throughout the world, sought the commission. The Smithsonian eventually culled the field to six, provided them with stipends and asked them to produce designs within 60 days.\u201cWe were competing against all these starchitects,\u201d Freelon said, including I.M. Pei, Norman Foster and Moshe Safdie. A committee composed of members of the Smithsonian, the architectural press and academics picked the Freelon Adjaye Bond/SmithGroup design.When the National Museum of African American History and Culture opened in 2016, Los Angeles Times architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne hailed the building\u2019s \u201cpowerful strangeness\u201d that \u201cembraces memory and aspiration, protest and reconciliation, pride and shame.\u201d He continued, \u201cThe museum\u2019s skin \u2014 has that typically benign architectural term ever been more charged? \u2014 allows it to stand apart from the Mall\u2019s white-marble monuments like a rebuke.\u201d The most recent accolade came in January, when the American Institute of Architects named the museum one of nine winners of its 2019 Honor Awards.Jacquelyn Martin/AP, FILETeam members from Freelon Adjaye Bond/ SmithGroup, who designed the winning concept for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, meet with members of the Smithsonian Institution, from left, Hall David, Peter Cook, Director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture Lonnie Bunch, David Adjaye, Phil Freelon, and Smithsonian Secretary Wayne Clough, in front of a model of the winning design, in Washington, D.C., April 14, 2009.During the opening ceremonies, which included a Kennedy Center performance by Nnenna, Freelon was walking with a cane. He\u2019d experienced leg troubles the previous year, although at first he didn\u2019t think much of it. \u201cI was run-down anyway, because 2015 was an intense year,\u201d he said. Not only was he finishing the museum, he was also teaching at MIT. He had also just completed a merger of his firm with the global architecture powerhouse Perkins + Will, which had been courting Freelon for more than a decade. Freelon now oversaw the firm\u2019s North Carolina operations from Durham.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that Phil was a superstar \u2014 and he really is the Michael Jordan of architecture,\u201d said Perkins + Will CEO Phil Harrison. \u201cWe wanted Phil because of his design sensibility, which is modern but not cold. There\u2019s a real humanism you can see in all his work. And with his staff you see a real diversity, not just in demographics but in thinking.\u201dWhen Freelon traveled to D.C., he would jog around the Mall to stay in shape. \u201cI noticed I\u2019d use the same effort, but it was taking me longer and longer to complete my course, and my right foot was dragging.\u201dAfter meeting with several doctors, Freelon was referred to Richard Bedlack, who heads Duke University\u2019s Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Clinic. Freelon was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, which is progressive and incurable. It attacks the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord and in time results in total paralysis and, ultimately, death \u2014 typically within two to four years after the diagnosis.Freelon was \u201cshocked and disappointed,\u201d he said, and there was a brief period of denial. But after a few months, Freelon told his staff and took a month off to ponder his future. \u201cBut I decided to go back and work full time,\u201d he said. Now, he uses a heavy electric wheelchair and works less and mainly from home. He remains on the Perkins + Will board of directors and is closely involved in ongoing projects.\u201cI\u2019m an optimist by nature, and I look at my prognosis as a glass half full,\u201d Freelon said. \u201cI\u2019m relieved I was able to raise my children and have a career and family.\u201dOne can drive a mile in almost any direction around Durham and come across a building Freelon designed. With his sister-in-law Debbie Pierce driving Freelon\u2019s customized van, we visited the Durham Bulls\u2019 Athletic Park, home to the country\u2019s most famous minor league baseball team featured in the movie Bull Durham; the Durham County Human Services Building, an airy, glass structure with a huge courtyard that replaced a grim, Soviet-style bureaucratic bunker; and several science buildings on the campuses of North Carolina Central, an HBCU, and Duke University.Few professions offer their practitioners a chance to leave a physical legacy, and I offered to Freelon that he must feel proud as we revisited his creations. He laughed and alluded to a famous Frank Lloyd Wright quote: \u201cA doctor can bury his mistakes, but an architect can only advise his clients to plant vines.\u201dOf course, Freelon didn\u2019t view his works as mistakes. He was being self-deprecating. But it was also significant that on our tour he insisted I visit a few buildings he didn\u2019t design.We parked in front of Duke University Chapel, a majestic Gothic structure with a 210-foot-tall bell tower. The chapel, along with other significant structures on Duke\u2019s campus, including Cameron Stadium, was designed by Julian Abele, an African-American architect who was the chief designer for the Philadelphia firm of Horace Trumbauer. \u201cThe story goes that when Abele came down here to do site work he had to dress up in overalls and pretend he was a common laborer or he wouldn\u2019t have been allowed on campus,\u201d Freelon said. It wasn\u2019t until the 1980s that the university formally acknowledged Abele\u2019s contributions, placing a portrait of the architect in the lobby of the main administration building and naming the main campus quad Abele Quad.Later, we pulled in front of a small church in a historically African-American neighborhood. Opened in 1931, it was originally a church for the deaf, who were recruited to work in Durham\u2019s noisy cigarette manufacturing plants. More recently, it had been rented to various congregations. Eventually, it was put up for sale and Phil and Nnenna Freelon purchased it. We went inside, where workers were renovating the space. Freelon had hired a friend who had more experience with such work to be the architect.The Freelons created a nonprofit, North Star Church of the Arts, to operate the building as a community space. (An inaugural service will be held Feb. 17.) \u201cWe\u2019ll have spoken-word nights, after-school programs, maybe some weddings and other ceremonies,\u201d Freelon said. \u201cWe just want to give back to the community.\u201dWe were in the back of the church. The pews had been pulled out and stacked to the side, and we looked toward an imaginary dais.Freelon has been involved in building celebrated structures that will last for many years. The Smithsonian museum likely will survive as long as our republic. But here he was inside a humble church that he didn\u2019t even design, smiling. \u201cNnenna and I wanted this to be our legacy project,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/15-year-sign-language-blind-deaf-man-cross/story?id=56139450", "headline": "15-year-old uses sign language to help blind and deaf man on cross ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "June 25, 2018, 10:38 PM", "text": "A California teen who recently helped a fellow passenger aboard an Alaska Airlines flight using sign language said today that she felt like she was meant to be on that plane.\"I think everything happens for a reason,\" Clara Daly, 15, told ABC station KABC-TV. \"I got put on a flight where I had purpose ... and was given a use.\"Clara and her mother, Jane Daly, were heading home from Boston after a visit with her grandmother when their flight was canceled.

Chaotic scene at shooting of infant - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "December 20, 2018, 5:58 AM", "text": "GALLUP, N.M. -- The screams of a teen caught the attention of Casey Franchot while eating at a Taco Bell. \"My baby's been shot! My baby's been shot!\" Shayanne Nelson yelled while holding an infant in a blood-soaked blanket.The 43-year-old former U.S. Army medic dropped his food and dashed across the busy the historic Route 66 highway in Gallup, New Mexico to a motel to investigate. He found what police described as a chaotic scene involving a distraught mother, a baby with a gunshot wound to the face, a confused 3-year-old boy and boyfriend trying to wipe away evidence.The scene also, a family member says, was the latest in a series of tragic episodes linked to a controlling boyfriend and a poor, Navajo teenage mom who hasn't fully recovered from the death of her fiance.Gallup police say detectives are still trying to connect the moments leading to a when a bullet from a .32 caliber revolver struck the face of an 8-month-old girl near her left ear and her left eye. The bullet, one officer said, left the infant deaf in one ear and may leave her blind in one eye.According to a police report, officers arrived at the Dec. 8 scene to find Franchot working to stop the baby from choking on her own blood. A 3-year-old boy stood on the passenger seat wearing only a diaper despite freezing temperatures outside. A frantic Nelson kept punching her car and crying.But who fired the gun remains a mystery. Nelson, 18, told police minutes after the shooting that she and her boyfriend, Tyrell Bitsilly, were in a shower at the Zia Motel when they heard a gunshot. She ran out to discover her daughter on the bed and bleeding from the face, she told police.Nelson said she believed her 3-year-old found a gun left by a prior occupant and accidentally shot his infant sister.But Franchot said as he worked to save the baby's life in the motel room, he saw Bitsilly, 21, wiping the gun with a towel. \"I was also prepared to grab the baby and roll on the room for cover in case he started shooting,\" Franchot said.Franchot then jumped in a police vehicle to rush the baby to Gallup Indian Medical Center. On the way, the officer warned Franchot every time they approached a bump, Franchot said.Gallup Police Officer Darius Johnson told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday that the 8-month-old girl now was being treated at an Albuquerque hospital and is in an induced coma.At the scene, Nelson and Bitsilly were arrested and charged with child abuse. Police also charged Bitsilly with tampering with evidence.However, court records show the December shooting wasn't the first time police linked Bitsilly to a shooting involving Nelson and her two children.In October, Gallup police arrested Bitsilly after authorities say he fired a weapon inside a car with Nelson, her mother and the two young kids. Bitsilly was charged with aggravated assault with deadly weapon, child abuse, shooting from a motor vehicle and tampering with evidence, court records said.\"Shayanne was trying to break up with him,\" Shanna Nelson, 39, the sister of Shayanne, said in an interview. \"He got mad and shot at the (car's) floorboard.\"After the October shooting, Shayanne promised to get a restraining order against Bitsilly, her sister said.The pair had been dating off and on since Shayanne's fiance \u2014 and the father of her two children \u2014 was killed in a car accident last year, Shanna Nelson said. He was often emotionally and physically abusive, she said. But the emotionally depleted Nelson, who regularly found herself with no place to stay, returned to Bitsilly for comfort and out of fear, according to her sister.During a court appearance Wednesday, Shayanne walked into court and waved to her sister and her niece. When McKinley County Magistrate Judge Robert Baca announced he was keeping her bond at $20,000, she threw her head back. \"She doesn't have $2,000 to get out,\" her sister said. \"None of us do.\"The 18-year-old stood motionless as lawyers agreed to postpone the preliminary hearing until Jan. 9 thanks to new video evidence. As police escorted Shayanne Nelson out, her tearful sister yelled, \"We love you, Shayanne!\"The young mother didn't look back.\u2014\u2014\u2014Follow Russell Contreras on Twitter at         http://twitter.com/russcontreras"}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/unconscious-man-pulled-burning-car-thrown-puddle-quick/story?id=59900991", "headline": "Unconscious man pulled from burning car, thrown in puddle by ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "December 19, 2018, 6:46 AM", "text": "Authorities in Texas shared body camera footage on Tuesday that showed officers pulling an unconscious man from a burning vehicle after a crash.The Chambers County Sheriff's Office shared the footage on its Facebook page, documenting two officers as they tossed the man into a puddle of water in an effort to extinguish the flames on his body.His vehicle, \"fully engulfed in flames,\" melted parts of the officers' uniforms, according to a statement from the sheriff's office.Chambers County Sheriff's OfficeA Texas sheriff's department shared body camera footage from a rescue on Tuesday, Dec. 18, 2018.\"The two deputies approached the vehicle without regard for their own safety and began reaching inside the vehicle to rescue the sole occupant,\" the sheriff's office said. \"Both deputies were able to place the injured man into a nearby water puddle and extinguish all flames on his body.\"(MORE: 6-month-old saved from frigid pond 'greatly improving,' police say)\"Both deputies were uninjured during their rescue of this man, however, the intensity of this fire melted parts of their equipment while on their uniforms,\" it added.Chambers County Sheriff's OfficeA Texas sheriff's department shared footage of officers saving a burning man on Tuesday, Dec. 18, 2018.Video of the heroic moment received more than 45,000 views and reactions on Facebook as users praised the officers, identified as Braedon Boznango and Carlton Carrington, for their bravery.(MORE: Deaf, blind puppy rescued after being 'tossed away like trash' in frozen creek)The sheriff's office said the man would have otherwise died in his vehicle if the deputies hadn't \"acted quickly, decisively and without total disregard for their own safety.\"The victim, who wasn't identified, was airlifted to a Houston hospital and last listed in critical condition.Chambers County is about 50 miles east of Houston."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/unruly-passenger-arrested-allegedly-launching-midair-tirade-denied/story?id=55455914", "headline": "Unruly passenger arrested after allegedly launching midair tirade ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "May 26, 2018, 12:59 PM", "text": "An airline passenger on an American Airlines flight to Miami was arrested after he allegedly launched into a midair, profanity-laced tirade and traded punches with others on the plane who were trying to restrain him.The whole incident was caught on tape after passenger Jason Felix began yelling at flight attendants over their refusal to sell him more alcohol, according to charging papers.An off-duty police officer on the plane, dressed in a blue plaid shirt in the video, stepped in to try to restrain the unruly passenger, but Felix only became more enraged.

Greene did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.In 2013, a \"fake\" sign language interpreter stood next to former President Barack Obama on stage during Nelson Mandela\u2019s memorial service, later raising questions over Secret Service security concerns.The South African government and the interpreter himself, Thamsanqa Jantjie, claimed he had a schizophrenic break down that caused him to see illusions during the event, impacting his attempted signing."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-shoot-kill-oklahoma-city-man-neighbors-shout/story?id=50002066", "headline": "Police shoot and kill Oklahoma City man as neighbors shout that he ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "September 22, 2017, 8:09 AM", "text": "\u2014 -- An Oklahoma City man was fatally shot by police as neighbors shouted that the man was deaf and could not hear officers' commands to drop a metal pipe he was holding, police said.The incident occurred Tuesday evening after an accident led officers to a house where Magdiel Sanchez, 35, was outside on the porch, Oklahoma City Police Capt. Bo Mathews said at a press conference Wednesday.The pipe Sanchez was carrying had been fashioned into a fairly large weapon, like a club, Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty said in a press conference Thursday afternoon. The pipe had been tied to Sanchez's wrist so that it wouldn't come out of his hand when used, Citty said.Officers were acting on information from a witness who told police where they could find a green truck allegedly involved in the accident, in which the truck hit something and drove off. No person was struck in the collision.Sanchez's family has hired Oklahoma City lawyer Melvin Hall, who represented the family of police-shooting victim Terrance Crutcher in 2016, to represent them, according to local ABC affiliate KOCO. Hall plans to hold a news conference with the family and local Catholic and Hispanic organizations Friday afternoon to bring further attention to the incident.The shooting took place after police Lt. Matthew Lindsey arrived at the location identified by the witness and found a green truck allegedly matching the description from the accident parked there.Sanchez was on the porch of the home when he advanced to the front yard holding what Mathews said was a pipe in his right hand.The police officer called for backup, and another officer, Sgt. Christopher Barnes, arrived, after which both officers shouted to Sanchez to drop the pipe he was carrying as he proceeded forward, Mathews said.The officers didn't hear neighbors at the scene yelling to them that Sanchez couldn't hear them, Mathews said.\"As he started going toward these officers with a pipe in his hand, the officers discharged their weapons,\" Mathews said.KOCOOklahoma City Police officers pursued the green truck seen in the surveillance recording, leading them to Magdiel Sanchez, who was later shot and killed by authorities.Lindsey fired his stun gun at the suspect, and Barnes shot his gun, hitting Sanchez.The stun gun did not work because only one of the prongs hit Sanchez, Citty said, adding that, in training, officers working in pairs are taught to first use a stun gun, but the second officer provides cover with a gun in case the stun gun doesn't work.Mathews said Sanchez received medical attention after he was shot, but was pronounced dead at the scene.Sanchez\u2019s neighbor, Julio Rayos, 37, told ABC News that Sanchez would \"always\" carry the pipe with him, mainly to shoo away the stray dogs that would roam the Shields-Davis neighborhood, south of downtown Oklahoma City.Rayos, who said he has lived in the neighborhood for 13 years, described Sanchez as a \"real good guy\" whom \"everybody knew.\"\"He didn\u2019t deserve to die like that,\" Rayos said.The officers on the scene had not yet been issued body cameras, Citty said, adding that he hopes to have every officer outfitted with one by the end of October.Barnes, the officer who used the gun, is on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated, Mathews said.Barnes is a sergeant and has been with the department for at least five years, Citty said. Police have interviewed the lieutenant who deployed the stun gun, but Barnes has not yet been interviewed because he wants his attorney to be present.Sanchez\u2019s father, who had allegedly been the driver of the green truck in the accident, confirmed after the shooting that his son was deaf, Mathews said. The son was not involved in the accident, he said.Sanchez's father will likely face misdemeanor charges for the accident, which Citty described as fairly serious. The vehicle that Sanchez's father allegedly hit rolled over, and the victim inside that car suffered minor injuries.Sanchez's father did not have a driver's license, which is allegedly why he fled, Citty said.Sanchez had to have been aware that they were police officers because they were in full uniform and drove marked vehicles to the home, Citty said.In addition to Sanchez's hearing disability, his father could not speak English, Citty said. The police department has reached out to the Oklahoma Association for the Deaf for suggestions on how to improve training for officers when dealing with deaf people in the future, Citty said.Sue Ogrocki/APJulio Rayos answers questions for the media in Oklahoma City, Sept. 20, 2017, concerning the officer involved shooting of Magdiel Sanchez.KOCO obtained cellphone video from a neighbor of Sanchez who said the footage was taken moments after the shooting. The neighbor, Julio Rayos, told the station that he screamed at officers that Sanchez was deaf. Rayos said he believes Sanchez may have been confused by the encounter with police.Rayos told The Oklahoman on Wednesday that in addition to being deaf, Sanchez was developmentally disabled and didn\u2019t speak, communicating mainly through hand movements. Rayos said he believes Sanchez became frustrated by trying to communicate with the police.\u201cThe guy does movements,\u201d Rayos told the newspaper. \u201cHe don\u2019t speak, he don\u2019t hear, mainly it is hand movements.

She stopped at a security checkpoint and an airport store looking for her departure gate.Airport surveillance video obtained by ABC-affiliate KXLY, shows Kekona at the top of an escalator, which she later said she thought was an elevator.

Some students were livestreaming \"13 Reasons Why\" at their lunchroom tables. Christie DeSano, a sign language teacher, approached Pam Fine, the dean of Oxford High School and the Olweus Bully Prevention coordinator, as she began to hear these conversations intensify this April.Fine decided it was time to develop a plan, according to Sweat.  So a team of staffers and the Bully Buster leadership class created the 13 Reasons Why Not project. She told ABC News they discussed how the project would unfold.\"What if we did the same format as the show. We have a student get on the intercom and tell a real story of a difficult time they have had in high school \u2014 cyberbullying, dating, home life, sexting \u2014 and when it gets to the part where they say, 'This tape is for you,' instead of naming the person who had hurt them, they name a person who helped them,\" Sweat said.  \"They thank the person and tell them why they are one of their 13 reasons why not. Then at the end of the tape, every day for 13 days, we would close with an anti-suicide message.\"The campaign began May 1, and throughout the week, the 1,800 students heard stories about body shaming, poverty, being told to kill themselves, feeling unwanted, trouble at home and more. Awareness boards immediately filled the school with 24-hour hotline numbers, anti-suicide messages and mental health referral information. Additionally, seven trained counselors were made available immediately, Sweat told ABC.The response has been positive, she said. On Day One, Riley Juntti, who shared her story about physical and emotional abuse, received more than 100 texts and tweets, which Sweat said were all positive. When it was Riley's time to provide a name, she said, \"So this tape is for you, Elise Godfrey,\" who had helped Riley through her hard time.Juntti told ABC News that the response to the program has been \"incredibly impactful.\"\"It created an environment in our school where it's acceptable to talk about mental illness,\" she told ABC News, \"or talk to people you have never talked to.\"\"Students have left flowers in the girls' bathrooms, along with messages on the mirrors telling them they are beautiful and awesome,\" Sweat said.She added that parents were originally upset because they were not given advance notice. After an email blast to parents went out, the support and gratitude came pouring in.Kayla Manzella was the youngest person on the school's volleyball team. She said the upperclassmen would bully her. Now in her senior year, as she shared her story.

He wanted to speak about his fears of coming out to his Catholic family, as well as tell students that he feels it is not OK to use the term \"gay\" negatively.  He told ABC it was difficult for him to recall his feelings as he wrote down what he was going to say to the student body.  He said it was \"a weird feeling\" because he knew others were listening but didn't know what they were thinking or feeling.Sweat said that, each day, countless students have gone to Fine's office to have their story shared with the school. Though the school will choose only 13 stories, the students are already being more supportive of one another than before.Oxford High School wants to make the new message clear, she said, \"Be each other's why nots.

Phillips Hospital of selling babies that were born at the hospital, including Price\u2019s daughter.In the mid-sixties, Homer G. Phillips was a highly respected hospital where many African American nurses and doctors were trained. Many considered it a beacon in the community. It is now a senior residential community.\"The place to buy was Homer G. [Phillips Hospital], and babies were being sold out of the parking lot. It was pay for play, cash on delivery,\" Watkins told \"20/20.\" \"There's no way it could've occurred without a coordinated and cooperative undertaking between multiple individuals and positions of authority.\"In the wake of the publicity brought on by Price's case, more than 100 women who gave birth at the hospital and were told their children died reached out to Watkins, hopeful their children might still be alive. The FBI even jumped on the investigation.A group of former Homer G. Phillips Hospital nurses said there's no way Price's story makes sense.\"No nurse would come and tell someone that their baby passed. That was the doctor's role and responsibility,\" former nurse Xenobia Thompson told \"20/20.\"The nurses said they are insulted that these accusations have been made about Homer G. Phillips Hospital with no evidence.Courtesy Diane GilmoreAfter her birth, Diane Gilmore was taken in by a foster family, who cared for her along with other foster children.But Watkins said he believes Gilmore was sold, and once the adoptive parents realized that she was deaf, they likely tried to return her. He said Price was then put through the foster care system and that the foster family who finally took her in was just in it for the money and likely involved in the cover up.\"It is clear that there were affirmative measures taken by that foster family to mislead Zella's baby Diane,\" Watkins said.Barbara Richardson, whose parents Muriel and John Young took Gilmore in as a foster child when Gilmore was 4 months old, told \"20/20\" that Watkins' allegations are completely untrue.Richardson said her parents were so excited to welcome Gilmore into their family and that they loved and treated Gilmore the same way they treated her. She resents any implication that her family was somehow involved in stealing a baby and says the reason her family took her in was because she had been left at the hospital.\"When it was time to be released, no one had been to see the child and no one came, you know. She was an abandoned baby, abandoned at birth,\" said Richardson, who was 25 years old at the time.Richardson said her parents even went looking for her biological mother when Gilmore was 9 years old. Muriel Young contacted a woman named Zella Mae Jackson in St. Louis, and asked her if she had given birth to a baby at Homer G. Phillips Hospital in November 1965, Richardson said. Courtesy Diane GilmoreDiane Gilmore was born prematurely and weighed just 2 pounds at birth.\"The woman just said, 'No, I didn't have a baby.' So, I mean, what do you do at that point?\" said Richardson. \"As far as we were concerned, that was not the woman.\" Price denies ever receiving such a call.Records also indicated that social workers visited Price's home in an effort to contact her, but she moved and didn't leave a forwarding address. The social workers even called, wrote and visited relatives, according to records. The workers noted that Price's grandmother and uncle were \"either unable or unwilling to give any information regarding Mrs. Jackson's whereabouts.\"In addition, Gilmore's birth certificate indicates that she was not born at Homer G. Phillips Hospital but at St. Louis City Hospital 1.Still, Price said no one ever tried to find her. Records do show there was another woman in St. Louis with the same name. And Price said she's sure that Gilmore was born at Homer G. Phillips Hospital.\"They said they tried to reach out to me. Look, I was easy to find. Why are they saying they tried to reach out to me? I'm a licensed driver. I worked at DePaul. I have a social security number, and you can't find me?\" Price said. \"My relatives said nothing to me that 'somebody was looking for you.' That's the first time I heard of it. Why are they doing this to me?\"Courtesy Diane Gilmore Diane Gilmore, who was born deaf, believed her mother had abandoned her at birth.The evidence was enough for U.S. Attorney Richard Callahan, who led the federal investigation into Watkins' and Price's allegations. He went public on Aug. 14 with his conclusion that there was no evidence that Price's baby was stolen.\"The only mystery in my mind is why the allegations were made to begin with,\" Callahan told \"20/20.\"Watkins suggested that the old documents may have been forged. He said Gilmore's birth certificate was counterfeit, including a fake doctor's stamp.\"[The birth certificate is] signed by a stamp with a Dr. Skaggs stamp. And Dr. Skaggs, if you look at that, was not a doctor as of that date \u2026 he was still a teenager at the time of Diane's birth,\" Watkins said.\"20/20\" was able to track down Skaggs, who was a full-fledged doctor when Gilmore was born and is currently retired and living in Florida.\"At the time of that delivery, I was 27 years old,\" Skaggs told \"20/20.\" \"This is my signature on the birth certificate, and it's similar to my signature right now.\"ABC NewsDiane Gilmore, 50, has four children, including her twin daughters Melika and Mehiska Jackson, who helped reunite her with her mother.Undeterred by the evidence, Watkins has vowed to find answers for the other hopeful mothers who came to him for help. Just last week, Watkins had a successful date in court. A judge ruled that St. Louis had to quickly release medical records for at least two dozen of those women.And days ago, Watkins went to court again, filing a new case in an attempt to annul Gilmore's adoption by her foster family. If allowed, he said, it would give him further power to issue subpoenas and more deeply investigate her case.Again asked by \"20/20\" last week whether he really believed Price's baby was intended to be sold, Watkins said, \"I haven't been able to-- I haven't been able to make that leap ... at this point given what I now know.\"Meanwhile, Price has focused on making up for lost time with her daughter. Over the summer, Gilmore moved to St. Louis to be with her mother, and Price is learning sign language to communicate better with Gilmore.\"I enjoyed my babies, I really did, and somebody else robbed me of that by telling me she passed. And another family was enjoying that,\" Price said. \"The only thing I got now is love.\"\"Our bond has gotten stronger, and I feel it's never going to break,\" Diane told \"20/20\" using sign language. \"Even though we were apart, we're together. And I think it's going to be a long, long time that we'll be strong together.\""}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=96707&page=1", "headline": "Son Gets 'Divorce' From Mom-Murdering Dad - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "January 7, 2006, 2:35 PM", "text": "July 26, 2004 -- When Patrick Holland sees Daniel Holland, he doesn't see his father. He only sees his mother's killer.Patrick, 14, believes Daniel Holland lost the right to call himself a father on Oct. 13, 1998 \u2014 the night he killed Patrick's mother, Liz Holland. That's why the teen sought \u2014 and received \u2014 a \"divorce\" from his biological father today.Daniel and Patrick Holland were scheduled to wage a legal battle over parental rights in a closed-door hearing that was scheduled to begin today in Norfolk County Probate and Family Court in Massachusetts. Daniel is serving a life sentence without chance of parole, but he still wanted updates on his son. Patrick cannot stand to call a convicted murderer \u2014 his mother's killer \u2014 his father.Instead of continuing the court fight, Daniel Holland agreed to a settlement that waived his right to play any part in Patrick's life. After settlement was reached, Patrick was relieved.\"It's like a big weight's been lifted off my shoulders, knowingthat I don't have to worry about him being in my life,\" Patricktold reporters today.To read more about Patrick Holland's \"divorce\" settlement, click here.Patrick and his foster parents have established an online memorial, \"Liz Holland Memorial Page: The Silent Killer \u2014 Domestic Violence.\" They hope it will help remind others that domestic violence is still a problem.\"Liz's death was the classic case of people turning the other way, turning a deaf ear, thinking, 'This is not my problem,' \" said Ron Lazisky, Patrick's foster father. \"People heard the beating, the screams and the gunshots and no one called police. And this was a pretty close-knit community where people would know what was going on.\"Ghosts of Abuse and a Two-Year WaitPatrick was only 8 when he found his mother shot and bludgeoned to death in their home in Quincy, Mass., seven miles south of Boston. It didn't take police long to arrest Daniel Holland. The couple had been in the middle of an ugly divorce. Because there was a history of domestic abuse, Liz, a 32-year-old surgical nurse, had won an order of protection against her estranged husband.Since the slaying, Patrick has lived in New Hampshire with his mother's best friends, Ron and Rita Lazisky, who became his legal guardians. The Laziskys said that despite their friendship with Liz Holland, they never met her husband.\"She kept him away from us, just like many people who are in domestic abuse situations,\" Ron Lazisky said. \"We never met him. She and my wife were close, like sisters, and she would confide in her. And then she [Liz] would confide in me sometimes, and there were times when she would be speaking to me over the phone and he would get mad and start yelling at her.\"After Liz Holland's death, the Laziskys and Patrick's maternal and paternal grandparents on both sides sought custody of the boy. The Laziskys got custody after reaching a settlement with Daniel Holland's parents, but agreed not to try to adopt Patrick until 2005, when he turned 15. Because there was had been no adoption, Daniel Holland's parental rights were neverterminated.Patrick waited two years for a court to hear his petition. He began his quest to have Daniel Holland's parental rights terminated when he learned that his father wanted access to his report cards and information about his progress in sports activities and psychological counseling.A Norfolk County, Mass., Probate and Family Court judge dismissed the case in February, saying Patrick and the Laziskys should have filed the petition in New Hampshire. Then officials from the Massachusetts Department of Social Services intervened and began to handle his case, and the judge reversed his decision.\u2018Divorce\u2019 PrecedentAs unusual \u2014 and tragic \u2014 as Patrick Holland's petition and story are, it's not unprecedented for children to seek \"divorces\" from their parents.In a landmark case in 1992, \"Gregory K.,\" a 12-year-old Florida boy, successfully sued to terminate his biological mother's parental rights so that he could be adopted by his foster parents. Gregory accused his mother, Rachel Kingsley, of repeated neglect and drug use and said that she had only cared for him for seven months out of his entire life.In 1994, two Pittsburgh foster children attempted to \"divorce\" their biological parents so that they could be adopted by foster parents who had cared for them for four years. The Pennsylvania Superior Court denied their petition and ordered them turned over to either a new foster family or to their biological parents, who had not lost their parental rights.A Milwaukee judge in 1996 allowed three children to end all their legal ties to their father, Mark Jocius. In their petition, the children cited his repeated drug use, his alleged mental abuse of them, and the many years the family had spent on welfare. Though the children were also allowed to change their surname, Jocius was still required to support them financially.Some critics of child divorces from parents argue that the cases set a dangerous precedent and could open the door to petitions from children every time they became angry with their parents or guardians. But others point out that these cases are still rare.\"You have not seen a floodgate, not even a trickle. There are plenty of cases where foster care has had to take children away from abusive parents against their will, because they still love them,\" said Howard Davidson, director of the American Bar Association's Center on Children and the Law.\"I have not seen a frivolous [parental divorce] case. Most have involved cases where kids have been severely abused or negatively impacted by a parent. Most have involved children who have spent time in foster care.\"Creating Unnecessary Fears?Other critics say the use of \"divorce\" to describe a child's petition to end a parent's legal ties to them sparks unnecessary angst in parents.\"The term 'divorce' to describe these proceedings is misleading and real misnomer,\" said Barbara Bennett Woodhouse, chair in family law and director of the Center on Children & Family at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.\"It implies there is a petition made with no fault. It gives normally good parents fear that their children will suddenly get up and demand a divorce when they get angry with them. The legal term is termination of parental rights with fault.\"The parents at the center of \"divorce\" cases with their children are usually accused of heinous behavior that either endangers children or is detrimental to their quality of life. Woodhouse stressed that requests to end their parent's legal ties usually involve older children who can understand the basic court proceedings and ramifications of their request.The courts, Woodhouse said, focus on the legal relationship between the parents and the children and try to find a solution that works in the child's best interests. But even if a child is allowed to terminate a parent's rights, the courts do not decide whether the youngster should pursue a personal relationship with the parent.\"That is up to the child,\" Woodhouse said. \"The court is concerned with the legal relationship. The personal relationship \u2014 whether or not the child [Patrick] will want to visit his father in jail or have a relationship with him down the line \u2014 is up to him.\"A Living \u2014 and Online \u2014 MemorialRight now, it doesn't look like Patrick Holland will have any kind of personal relationship with his biological father in the near future.Ron Lazisky said he and his wife would file papers immediately to adopt Patrick. As a victim and survivor of domestic abuse, Patrick said he hopes his case and the online memorial to his mother will bring more attention to the ongoing problem. By telling his tale of domestic violence, he hopes to change other people's lives \u2014 while still honoring his mother's memory.\"There's nobody else like her in the world,\" Patrick told ABC News in a previous interview. \"She would help me with anything. She'd give her life for me.\"Patrick's online memorial to his mother can be found at www.lizhollandmemorial.com. He and the Laziskys will dedicate a memorial to Liz Holland at the United Methodist Church in Sandown, N.H., on Aug. 7."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/thousands-apply-adopt-saddest-dog-world/story?id=34937599", "headline": "Thousands Apply to Adopt 'Saddest Dog in the World' - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "November 4, 2015, 1:52 PM", "text": "\u2014 -- \u201cThe Saddest Dog in the World\u201d needs a new nickname.The 1-year-old Labrador retriever mix, who earned the title after a Facebook photo of her looking down in a kennel went viral, has been placed in a temporary foster home and has received 2,240 applications for adoption, Canadian nonprofit Rescue Dogs Match said on Facebook.Lana was rescued by Rescue Dogs Match in Ontario when she was a puppy.

They have sent a letter to the Lesko family ordering Danica to stop using sign language on the school bus or risk a three-day suspension.The March 30 letter from her principal that said Danica was \"doing sign language after being told it wasn't allowed on the bus.\"The Leskos may file a lawsuit over the sign language ban, claiming officials are violating Danica's civil rights and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act.\"She has a hearing problem, and now she's being punished for using sign language,\" Mary Ann Lesko, Danica's mother, told The Star-Ledger of Newark. \"It's absurd.\"Danica's parents told the paper that other students who rode to school with their daughter made fun of her, and refused to stay in their seats as they teased other girls who were using sign language. They said school officials are singling out Danica and not addressing those who should really be reprimanded.Schools Officials: Safety FirstIn a statement released through the school district's attorney, David Rubin, the Branchburg Board of Education refused to discuss the details of Danica's case, saying only that its version of events differs from the parents' version.However, the board insisted it has not violated anyone's rights and is only trying to protect other students who must ride on the school bus.\"The Board is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to all students with disabilities, and is satisfied that there has been no violation of that policy in this case,\" officials said in the statement. \"The Board is also committed to assuring the safety of all students who travel on District buses, and will continue to take appropriate steps to accomplish that goal.\"One deaf-rights advocate said Danica's parents have a strong basis for a lawsuit because sign language could be a considered a foreign language, and school officials could be violating the girl's First Amendment right to communicate.\"Why should there be a ban?\" asked Charlotte Karras, outreach coordinator for the Edison, N.J.-based Alliance for Disabled in Action. \"It's a violation of her communication rights. She's said it's the only way she can communicate with her friends \u2026 It's [the ban] against the ADA and violates the First Amendment and her family can file a discrimination suit citing the Americans With Disabilities Act.\"Karras said her organization would be willing to help the Leskos with any legal action.Danica's parents say she began losing her hearing last November, when a classmate allegedly shot a bottle rocket near her ear.

Varner was stabbed to death Feb. 3 in his dorm room in Cogswell Hall on the Gallaudet campus. Eric Plunkett was beaten to death in September in his room on the first floor of Cogswell Hall.Mesa was arrested Tuesday night and admitted to the slayings, police said. Authorities believe robbery was the motive for the killings.\"The motive in both of these murders was robbery,\" said D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey. \"We have the utmost confidence in the strength of this case. There wasn't even an argument or a fight that seemed to have led to it or a moment of rage.\"Police said Mesa cashed at least one check belonging to Varner after his death and used Plunkett's debit card after his slaying. In a search of Mesa's room, police also said they found blood-stained shoes and clothing. Ramsey said 18-year-old Thomas Minch of Greenland, N.H., who was charged with Plunkett's murder in October, has now been cleared of suspicion.Mesa said nothing during his arraignment in court today as a sign language interpreter to relayed information to him during the proceedings.Campus Relieved, Yet HeartbrokenMesa lived in the Krug Hall dormitory next to Cogswell Hall. Though students expressed relief that police had made an arrest, they also grieved because the alleged killer is one of their own.\"We were really hoping that it wasn't a student,\" said Gallaudet student Jessica Young. \"But there was a suspicion that it was someone inside the community.\"\"We feel like a family here. And for someone to have committed those murders from our community, it's embarrassing. And at the same time, it's also a scary thought,\" said another student Rebecca Goldenbaum.Early in the investigation, police had expressed their concerns that it would be difficult to communicate with witnesses, and also noted that because Gallaudet is a school for the deaf, students would not have heard noises that could have provided clues. But now they say most of their hard work is over.However, for many students it will be a long time before the campus will be back to normal.

There are the tears and the babies make faces, so there are visual cues to crying aside from the sound.Christian said that for deaf parents the trigger for frustration could be seeing the baby constantly crying or feeling the baby's distress when they hold the child.\"People who can hear would think that if you couldn't hear the crying, it would be less frustrating because what triggers us it that sound,\" Christian said. \"It was probably something about what that baby was doing that triggered the same frustration and those feelings [in the deaf parents].\"Cupich-Quinones has been charged with capital murder and Zuniga has been charged with injury to a child.Richardson police responded to a report of an unresponsive child around 5:30 a.m. on Sunday. When they arrived, the father had the child in his arms and the baby was \"pale, not breathing, and had bruises on her arms,\" according to a police search warrant.The officer performed CPR until paramedics arrived and took the child to a hospital. The hospital reported that the child had suffered \"massive trauma to back of the head, bruising to the child's back, chest, and both arms,\" according to the warrant.The baby died at the hospital.\"It was pretty bad, certainly something children shouldn't have to go through,\" Perlich said. He did not know if the child was deaf.In an initial interview, using an interpreter, Cupich-Quinones told police he had gotten up around 3 a.m. to get a drink of water and noticed the child lying on the living room floor near the small day bed the baby slept in. He said the child was faint of breath so he woke up his wife and eventually contacted their interpreter who called the police.His story would soon change.Another deaf man who lived at the house, Charles Niel, indicated to police that their search should include the backyard where there were beer cans and whiskey bottles.\"Niel pointed at the couple and then put his hand to his mouth indicating they had been drinking,\" the police report said. Police found the beer cans, whiskey bottles and other containers of alcoholic beverages at the house, according to the search warrant.When the couple were brought to the police station for additional interviews, police said Cupich-Quinones voluntarily waived his rights and agreed to answer questions.He allegedly told police that he and his wife had been drinking and had gotten \"into an argument over the child crying.\"He said he tried to give the child to Zuniga but she was \"too intoxicated\" and would not take the child.Police say the father told them that he was holding the baby with both hands around the torso and shaking the baby at around 12:30 a.m. He allegedly told police he \"hit the back of the child's head on the kitchen counter at least three times,\" according to the report. He also allegedly struck the child's face, knocking her off the counter and onto the kitchen floor.He told police he then left the infant with Zuniga who allegedly put the baby to bed and went back to her room to sleep. Cupich-Quinones said he went outside to smoke a cigarette and then went back to bed. He stated that at around 3:30 a.m., he woke up and began to argue with his wife about who was at fault for hurting the baby.The argument allegedly went on for two hours before police were called.\"Hector Cupich-Quinones admitted that his assaultive actions caused the death of the child and took full responsibility for committing this offense,\" according to the police report.After being read her rights, Zuniga invoked her right to counsel and did not provide a statement to police.Both parents are being held at the Dallas County jail.

If there is a connection between the first murder and this, I sure hope they'll solve it,\" he said.  \"If that killer is one of the students, surely there is somebody  \u2026  that has some kind of suspicions.\"Rebecca Goldenbaum, 22, a senior and resident assistant in another dorm, says she has no suspicions about the death \u2014 only fear.\"I don't want to be alone,\" she says.  \"We're completely shocked. \u2026 I'm feeling just numb \u2014 just total disbelief.\"\"The students feel safe here \u2014 they always feel safe,\" adds Chris Kaftan, 22.  \"If it happens here, that means it could happen anywhere.\"University officials say they have ramped up security \u2014 including identification checks of everyone stepping foot on campus and 24-hour patrols in each dorm by faculty and staff \u2014 in an effort to ensure that it does not happen again at Gallaudet\"We're taking every possible step to assure student safety on-campus,\" said Jane Fernandes, the university provost. \"Students are concerned for their safety.

The implants don't exactly mimic hearing, so Sammie thinks voices sound like robots.Unlike a hearing aid, which amplifies existing sounds, the cochlear implant is designed to directly stimulate the auditory nerve, bypassing the damaged part of the ear. First, an implant is surgically placed beneath the skin. Three weeks later, it is turned on and works with an earpiece to process sounds and stimulate the nerve.\"When a cochlear implant is turned on, people will hear things they've never heard before,\" said Dr. Jennifer Smullen, who has performed hundreds of implant surgeries at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. \"It's like someone who really needed glasses, put them on and realized they were missing the sunset.\"Hicks's new favorite activity is taking long walks outside so she can listen to the birds, her mother, Jenifer, told ABC News. Other sounds are more annoying, on the other hand, like the air conditioner and the sound of her classmates turning pages.\"She wasn't expecting school to be quite so loud,\" Jenifer said. \"She can hear everyone eating their snacks and writing on paper. And she can hear them breathing.\"Sammie's younger brother, 9, went deaf \"rapidly\" over the last two years and just had the same cochlear implant surgery, Jenifer said. His implants will be turned on June 7.\"When we brought him home from surgery, she broke down in tears because she knew what he was going through,\" Jenifer said. \"She wouldn't leave his side.\"In yesterday's video diary entry, Jenifer asked Sammie if she had any advice for her brother.\"After it gets turned on, it's not going to be what you expected, of course,\" Sammie said, followed by a few more robot sounds. \"If you jump around, the thing will fall off. \"Samie's brain learns how to process the information from the implants every day, Smullen explained.And as she learns, she'll update her video diary and share new sounds with the world."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93466&page=1", "headline": "School Bus Sign Language Ban Lifted - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "January 7, 2006, 3:14 PM", "text": "B R A N C H B U R G, N.J., April 26, 2001 -- A hearing-impaired New Jersey girl willnot be barred from using sign language on her school bus as long asshe obeys all the district's safety rules.Danica Lesko, 12, was told by her school principal last monththat she would be suspended for three days if she did not stop,because the use of sign language was \"disruptive.\"District officials in Branchburg were soon bombarded with calls and e-mails from people and groups around the country, who questioned why theban was needed.

She has written broadly on themes of multiculturalism, racism and ethnicity, according to a list of publications on her online faculty bio.At a demonstration this afternoon outside the Teachers College, Constantine challenged the person or persons who hanged the hateful symbol.\"Pinning a noose on my door reeks of cowardice and fear on many, many levels,\" Constantine said to applause. \"I would like the perpetrator to know I will not be silent.\"Teachers College President Susan Furhman sent an e-mail to students and faculty Tuesday afternoon explaining why police from the city's hate crimes task force were on the campus.\"The TC community and I deplore this hateful act, which violates every Teachers College and societal norm,\" the e-mail read, which was released to ABC News.Columbia University President Lee Bollinger also took on the incident in a written statement released to the Columbia Spectator, the campus newspaper. \"This is an assault on African-Americans and therefore is an assault on every one of us,\" Bollinger said in the statement.Police were checking campus security cameras to determine whether the act was caught on tape.

That same week in Detroit, a deaf and mute man wielding a garden rake was shot and killed by an officer.A Detroit police officer was charged with manslaughter Wednesday in that city\u2019s slaying, and an investigation is under way in the other.The shootings in two very different communities have heightened questions about whether police officers, in small towns and larger cities, are properly trained about when to \u2014 and not to \u2014 use deadly force.In Boise, Idaho, a spate of recent deadly shootings in an otherwise tranquil Western city brings the issue to a public debate.\u201cOfficers can begin to see everybody they deal with as being a threat,\u201d said Pierce Murphy, a community ombudsman in Boise. \u201cNot a potential threat but a real threat.\u201dShootings on Rise in Small TownsWhile high-profile shootings, like the 1998 slaying of Amadou Diallo, who was killed by four New York City officers who mistook his wallet for a gun, have brought the issue of police shootings to the national forefront, there is an indication that such shootings are happening more often in small-town America.The U.S. Department of Justice does not require police departments to report deadly shootings statistics. Some FBI statistics indicate the number of people fatally shot by police each year has changed little in the past five years, with about 360 dying at the hands of police in one recent year.But researchers who study trends in crime suspect an important shift may be under way: Police-related fatalities and instances of abuse, which have traditionally been associated with large urban areas, are occurring in smaller cities and towns.In the Colorado case, Eric Vantslot, 30, was shot and killed by sheriffs\u2019 deputies in the town of Lyons after the man aimed what appeared to be a gun at them. After the shooting, investigators discovered the object was a cigarette lighter that resembled a semiautomatic handgun.The officers are on paid administrative leave while the case is investigated.More Force, Little TrainingPeter Kraska, a professor of police studies at Eastern Kentucky University, says he believes the number of shootings in smaller towns may be on the rise because officers are being pushed to deal with more violent criminals as drugs flow into the nation\u2019s smaller communities.He says a Defense Department program has also put more military gear \u2014 automatic rifles, armored personnel carriers and night vision goggles \u2014 in the hands of local police who are often poorly equipped to use the equipment.\u201cI think it\u2019s an extremely risky way to do policing and it puts police officers and citizens unnecessarily in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Kraska said.Many argue that police officers, particularly in small municipalities, do not get the proper training in firearms use and tactics that could prevent deadly shootings.Ron Kilman, chief of the LeRoy Police Department, outside Bloomington, Ill., said although his department has not had to deal with a deadly shooting incident, he sees the need for additional training. Kilman says he seeks out free training for his officers.\u201cUnfortunately, most small towns do not have the funds or the resources to be able to provide the same caliber of training that large municipalities are able to afford,\u201d Kilman said.But Kilman says it is also difficult to predict how an officer will react when  placed in a threatening situation. Across the nation, from small towns to large cities like New York and Los Angeles, police forces agree that deadly force should be used when an officer feels his life is being threatened.When Is it Justified?But the question is always raised when police are involved in a shooting: When is it justified to kill someone? In New York, despite widespread public outcry, a jury decided the four officers were justified in killing the unarmed Diallo \u2014 largely because they believed the officers\u2019 testimony that they feared for their lives.\u201cAlmost any officer when he pins his badge on has been trained extensively in what the law mandates when it comes to use of deadly force,\u201d Kilman said. \u201cHowever, the bottom line is you get an officer out there who gets into a situation that turns violent quickly and you scare that officer bad enough than he goes either into a fight-or-flight mentality.\u201dPolice officers, said John Bowman, an associate professor at the Police Training Institute at the University of Illinois, are trained to fight, not run from a situation.\u201cThere are people out there who need to be shot by the police,\u201d said Bowman, who is an experienced firearms and tactics trainer, who says the problem, actually, might be that police don\u2019t use force often enough. He argues that officers need to do what it takes to protect themselves from harm or death.    \u201cThe reality is that every day in this country people unlawfully place others in great bodily harm. The problem we have is getting officers to shoot when it is justified.\u201d\u2018An Act of Self-Defense\u2019In the small town of Carnegie, Okla., the community is still debating the fatal shooting in March of an American Indian woman who raised a shovel above her head in a confrontation with a rookie police officer.The officer, Russell Williams, had had the required nine-week training at Oklahoma\u2019s Council on Law Enforcement and Training (CLEET) program, a course required by the state for all police officers, said police chief, Randall Hileman. The training includes lessons on when to use deadly force, he said. The officer was not charged in that case.Hileman said he believes Williams, who has since resigned, was justified in using his weapon. The officer, he said, had tried talking to the victim and using  pepper spray before firing.\u201cIt was an act of self-defense, \u201d Hileman said. \u201cIt was to the point that either this officer was going to get seriously injured or killed. Even above training, you have to protect yourself and your life.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=4805230&page=1", "headline": "Amber Alert Girl Now a Murder Suspect - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "July 3, 2008, 11:25 AM", "text": "May 7, 2008\u2014 -- A Florida grand jury will decide whether a 15-year-old girl whose disappearance triggered an Amber Alert should be tried as an adult in the murder of a man she and her boyfriend allegedly beat and suffocated.Authorities in Florida issued arrest warrants on first-degree murder charges against the teenager, Amanda Morgan Leppert, and Toby Lee Lowry, 22.  Authorities say the couple fled the state  April 25 in a stolen pickup truck belonging to murder victim James Thomas Stewart, 66.Both remain in custody in El Paso, Texas, where police found them Saturday, 1,600 miles from home, panhandling by an interstate highway after a motorist recognized Leppert from a nationally publicized Amber Alert.Stewart was found dead inside his Melrose, Fla., home  May 1. His Toyota Tacoma was missing from his driveway. An autopsy found that he had been beaten, stabbed and suffocated before he died, authorities said.\"Mr. Stewart had been viciously beaten with two metal rods and had been stabbed multiple times with a knife,\" Putnam County Sheriff Dean Kelly said at a press conference Tuesday. \"The autopsy also revealed that Mr. Stewart had been suffocated with a plastic garbage bag that had been put over his head.\"Leppert was originally reported missing  April 22. Her mother told police that she feared her daughter may be with Lowry, a Florida man with a lengthy criminal history in Putnam and Clay counties.Lowry was released from a 20-month prison sentence last summer. Kelly said Leppert and Lowry may have become romantically involved sometime last fall. It was unclear how they'd met, but Kelly said it could have been over MySpace.After Stewart's family reported to police that the 66-year-old, who's hard of hearing, had not contacted them in days, police entered the house and discovered the murder scene.Leppert had left behind her phone at Lowry's house when she disappeared, Kelly said at yesterday's press conference, and authorities saw that a call had been made from Stewart's home to Leppert's phone April 25. With the pickup truck missing and Stewart dead, authorities had reason to believe that Lowry -- and perhaps Leppert -- were involved in his death. A warrant was issued for Lowry's arrest on charges of auto theft and interfering with child custody.Authorities tracked the pair in the truck through three states  to Texas. According to a timeline provided by the Putnam County Sheriff's Office, the  two stopped at a Gainesville, Fla., Wal-Mart after the murder and bought new clothing.They dumped the cap to their victim's trunk and picked up a hitchhiker in Georgia who authorities said  was unaware of the homicide. The trio decided to head for California. The vehicle is spotted in Biloxi, Miss.,  April 29; Crowley, La.,  April 30; and finally Katy, Texas,  May 1.Two days later, a motorist reported seeing the couple, along with the hitchhiker   they'd  picked up in Georgia, panhandling Saturday in El Paso.Authorities believe that Leppert and Lowry spent the first few days following her disappearance in Putnam County on the lookout for a crime of opportunity. They spent time in a wooded area behind Stewart's house before Leppert knocked on the man's door and asked to use his phone.\"There was no prior relationship,\" Kelly said Tuesday of the alleged decision to attack Stewart. \"They cased the area looking for an easy mark.\"After placing the call to her own phone, she returned to Lowry and reported that Stewart was vulnerable. Later that night, Kelly said, the two entered the house and committed the murder.Authorities said that the Amber Alert worked as planned in this case. If Leppert had been 18, they would not have been able to publicize that she was missing as widely.At 15, Kelly said, they had to at least assume there was a possibility that she was being held against her will.\"We said all along that she was a victim until we proved otherwise,\" Kelly said. \"And we've proved otherwise.\"Florida authorities expect the pair to be extradited from Texas to Florida by the end of this week.

It did not appear to be a splashing injury,\" wrote Det. Wallis Stefan in the affidavit. \"It seemed to have a mud-mask, or cosmetically applied mask, appearance to it.\"Stefan said Storro had \"no injuries to her neck, hands, or upper chest area that may have been indicative of having chemical splashed on her face.\"The detective also compared Storro's account to other acid attacks that had occurred around the same time across the country and found no similarities among the cases. Bethany Storro Told Cops She Was Trying to Kill Herself With Acid Investigators also learned that no sunglasses had been purchased at the store where Storro had claimed buying the ones that protected her eyes during the attack. Sunglasses also were not found at the scene of the alleged crime.On Sept. 16, when authorities entered Storro's home to execute a search warrant for evidence that she had made up the attack, Storro came clean, telling officers that she \"should go to jail.\"During her admission, which spanned more than an hour and a half and was 88 pages in length when transcribed, Storro said that she had dabbed acidic drain cleaner to her face with a towel in a park bathroom hours before the call was placed to police on Aug. 30.Storro admitted to purchasing drain cleaner and a pair of gloves and at a hardware store, according to the court documents.\"I thought there would be no evidence of me doing it to myself,\" she told Stefan according to the affidavit. \"I thought that you guys would give up trying to find the person and it would be done.\"Storro had helped police develop a sketch of her alleged attacker -- a black woman with ear piercings -- in the days after the alleged attack. It is not yet clear why Storro described the suspect the way she did.During her statement to police, Storro detailed how she'd spent some of the more than $25,000 in donations that her story had garnered from people who were sympathetic to Storro.Storro told police that she'd \"purchased dinners for her parents,\" \"stuff at Target\" and \"clothes for herself,\" with the money. She also paid off most of a $620 bill for a laser facial peel that she had had a few weeks before the allegedly faked attack.She also purchased an \"Apple computer after being released from the hospital\" but told police that she had returned the item, according to the court documents. Arrest Warrant Issued for Acid Attack Hoaxer Bethany Storro In a statement to the media last week, Storro's parents issued an apology on behalf of their daughter, saying that Storro was \"extremely sorry for the pain\" she had caused.\"As any good parent would, we stood by our daughter when she told us these different scenarios,\" said Joe Neuwelt, Storro's father. \"We stood by her, we believed her. Any good parent would do that.\"\"There was no reason to doubt her at all,\" Neuwelt said.Tony Golik, a deputy prosecutor, told ABC affiliate KATU there is now a warrant for Storro's arrest, though it will not be carried out immediately because she is still in a local hospital.He said prosecutors will seek higher-than-usual penalties because, as one court document put it, \"the defendant committed the offense against a victim who was acting as a Good Samaritan.\"Storro, who is partially deaf, has been married once before, but had no children. She was still on friendly terms with her ex-husband and her former mother-in-law initially came to her defense when rumors suggested the attack was a hoax."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=94377&page=1", "headline": "High Court Hears English-Only Case - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "January 7, 2006, 3:03 PM", "text": "Jan. 16, 2001 -- Martha Sandoval, a Spanish-speaking U.S. resident, is a housecleaner and shopkeeper who moved to Mobile, Ala., from Mexico in 1987.Although she can read road signs in English, Sandoval does not understand the state's driver's license exam. Thanks to the \"English-only\" amendment to the Alabama Constitution, making English the state's official language, Sandoval was forbidden to take the test in Spanish.In 1996, Sandoval filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court, claiming the now-defunct policy was unconstitutional because it discriminated against her under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Title VI of the law prohibits any federally-funded agencies, including Alabama, from discriminating on the basis of national origin.The U.S. Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case today, is considering whether a private citizen should be allowed to sue the state on these grounds.The Fabric of the LawDuring this morning's oral argument session, an attorney representing Alabama said the civil rights law does not specifically call for private lawsuits like Sandoval's against the states. Congress never intended for citizens to have such power, the state argues. \"States are not run-of-the-mill defendants,\" attorney Jeffrey Sutton told the court.But Eric Schnapper, Sandoval's attorney, told the high court that allowing private lawsuits had become \"an established partof the fabric of law.\" Also supporting Sandoval's claims, U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman said case law during the past 35 years suggests that such private suits may be brought.Chief Justice William Rehnquist seemed skeptical. \"This isan area where there is no precise authority, one way oranother,\" he said.Questioning the\"sweeping\" nature of Sutton's argument, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it would apply to all laws that may be silent about a private right to sue.The case began 5 years ago when Sandoval first asked the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama to declare the policy unconstitutional and enjoin the state from testing only in English.From Spanish to FarsiThe lower court heard evidence that an estimated 13,000 adult Alabama residents, mostly of foreign descent, would have difficulty getting a driver's license because of the English-only policy.In February 1998, the district court ruled in favor of Sandoval and the class of plaintiffs, and directed the state to create a policy aimed to accommodate those non-English-speaking Alabama residents seeking driver's licenses.The lower court found that the state policy \"singled out\" non-English-speaking residents who applied for an Alabama driver's license, and found the state's justification for the tests meritless because the agency had administered tests for years in foreign languages with no reports of problems, safety or otherwise.For years, the state of Alabama  \u2014 like most other states  \u2014 allowed would-be drivers to take Class D license exams in an array of foreign languages, from Spanish to Farsi.In the wake of the English-only amendment, ratified in July 1990, the license exam rules were changed to forbid the exams from being administered in any language other than English. Interpreters, translation dictionaries, and other interpretive aids officially were denied to non-English speakers, even though the state allows such accommodations for illiterate, hearing-impaired, deaf, and disabled applicants.High Court Clarification NeededThe state also allows non-English-speaking drivers from other states and foreign countries to exchange a valid out-of-state license for an Alabama license without taking the written exam.At least 20 states have policies designating English as their official state language, but few restrict government use of other languages.A panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court decision, finding  \"the English-only official policy constituted a disparate impact on the basis of national origin.\"The Supreme Court has never clearly decided whether such a \"private right of action\" exists under the civil rights law.Three English-language advocacy groups and a number of U.S. congressmen including Alabama Republicans Bob Riley and Spencer Bachus and Georgia Republican Bob Barr filed briefs in support of the state.A ruling in the case, Alexander vs. Sandoval, is expected by July."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/acid-attack-hoaxer-bethany-storro-plead-guilty/story?id=11753665", "headline": "Acid Attack Faker Bethany Storro Pleads Not Guilty - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "September 21, 2010, 3:44 PM", "text": "VANCOUVER, Wash. Sept. 29, 2010 \u2014 -- The Oregon woman who doused her own face in acid and went on a shopping spree with the donations intended for her recovery pleaded not guilty today to theft charges.Bethany Storro appeared in a Vancouver courtroom flanked police and court officers. She was dressed in a blue shirt, black pants and flip flops, but the focus of her appearance was her mutilated face, marred by large and bright red scars. She was charged during the brief hearing with three counts of second degree theft.It was the 28-year-old's first public appearance since she held a press conference from her hospital when her head was fully bandaged and she described a bogus attack on her.Storro's lawyer, Andrew Wheeler, entered the not guilty plea on behalf of his client. He reminded the judge that Storro is partially deaf because of a childhood illnes, but that she can read lips.When asked by Judge John F. Nichols if that was her plea, Storro responded in a strong voice, \"Yes.\"Storro will be processed at Clark County Jail and released to continue rehabilitation at her home. If convicted, she  could face up to five months in jail for the jaw-dropping hoax.  Her father has promised that the money will be returned.Storro's trial is set to begin on Dec. 20.Storro was once believed to be the victim of a crime after she told authorities in August that a black woman had  had splashed her face with acid.Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Michael Welner said the full psychological effects of what she did to herself may not hit until much later.\"She's going to realize that she mutilated herself in a very severe way,\" Welner told \"Good Morning America\" today. \"The burden is powerful.\"But as her story began to unravel, Storro confessed to police that there hadn't been an attack -- that she'd put the acid on her own face, first to kill herself, then to cause injuries so severe it would warrant surgery to give her a new face.Welner said he wasn't buying the story that Storro had wanted to kill herself.\"If she wanted to kill herself, she could have drunk a small quantity,\" he told \"GMA.\" \"She was planning for tomorrow.\"Welner, who is not treating Storro, said it seemed as if the woman was suffering from a severe form of body dysmorphic disorder in which patients perceive they have flaws that others don't see.\"For them to disfigure themselves is very rare,\" he said.  \"I'd want to know what is her expectation of how severe these burns would be.\"Investigators found that Storro had paid a $620 bill for a chemical facial peel last month with some of the $20,000 the community had donated for her recovery. The police report said Storro had spent about $1,500 purchasing clothes, train tickets, a computer and dinners for her parents.\"Any money will be returned in the appropriate manner. That will be guaranteed,\" Peter Neuwalt said after his daughter came forward to admit the hoax days after she canceled an appearance on \"Oprah.\" Bethany Storro Told Cops She Was Trying to Kill Herself With Acid According to court documents, Storro abandoned the thought of suicide as she dabbed the acid on her face.\"When I realized it wasn't killing me, I thought maybe this was the answer to all my problems,\" she  said in her statement to police, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by ABC News. \"To have a completely different face.\"The court documents reveal that even Storro's surgeon doubted the attack, telling investigators that her injuries did not reflect being splashed by acid.\"Storro's facial skin seemed to be burned, but it was an even pattern over her face. It did not appear to be a splashing injury,\" wrote Detective Wallis Stefan in a court affidavit. \"It seemed to have a mud-mask, or cosmetically applied mask, appearance to it.\"Stefan said Storro had \"no injuries to her neck, hands, or upper chest area that may have been indicative of having chemical splashed on her face.\"The detective also compared Storro's account to other acid attacks that had occurred around the same time across the country and found no similarities among the cases.Investigators also learned that no sunglasses had been purchased at the store where Storro had claimed buying the ones that protected her eyes during the attack. Sunglasses also were not found at the scene of the alleged crime.On Sept. 16, when authorities entered Storro's home to execute a search warrant for evidence that she had made up the attack, Storro came clean, telling officers that she \"should go to jail.\"During her admission, which spanned more than an hour and a half and was 88 pages long when transcribed, Storro said that she had dabbed acidic drain cleaner to her face with a towel in a park bathroom hours before the call was placed to police  Aug. 30.\"I thought there would be no evidence of me doing it to myself,\" she told Stefan, according to the affidavit. \"I thought that you guys would give up trying to find the person and it would be done.\"ABC News' Sarah Netter contributed to this story.

The speculation took on increased prominence after the 28-year-old canceled a scheduled appearance on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" Storro was slated to be on \"Oprah\" Thursday.Storro's former in-law Pamela Storro came to her defense today, calling the allegations that the attack was fabricated \"insane.\"\"There is no way ever that she would do anything like this,\" said Pamela Storro. She said the suggestion that Bethany Storro could have thrown the acid in her own face is  \"as hideous as the crime itself.\"On a post on her Facebook page on Friday, which has since been removed, Storro wrote that while she had originally wanted to appear on the show to \"inspire people and tell them about Jesus,\" she changed her mind.\"The show was going to possibly turn into another direction, so my family and I decided not to go on,\" she wrote. \"I hope you understand and will still check in on me.\"A spokeswoman for Winfrey's show confirmed to ABCNews.com that Storro had canceled her appearance during which she was expected to speak about \"her account of being attacked and scarred with acid.\" No reason for the cancelation was given by the show.The Vancouver Police Department has been looking into Storro's acid attack for nearly two weeks. No arrests have been made so far.Storro's decision to pull out of the Oprah interview came just a day after several media reports  suggesting that the acid attack that garnered her national media attention might have been intentional.The Columbian newspaper reported on the speculation that there might be more to Storro's story, saying that one of their own commenter's claimed that Storro has claimed she'd been the victim of a \"similar, earlier attack by another woman in another state.\"The police department in Priest River, Idaho, where Storro lived until last year, told ABCNews.com that no crime had ever been reported by Storro.Acid Victim Is Partially DeafAnd a Vancouver Voice reporter wrote about visiting the park where Storro was attacked and spoke to witnesses \u2013 homeless people who identified themselves only by their street names \u2013 who told him that Storro was \"clearly alone when she dropped to the ground screaming.\"The Vancouver Police Department declined to comment on any of the rumors, saying only that the investigation is ongoing.Pamela Storro remains convinced that her former daughter-in-law is not one to make up such a \"tragic incident.\"\"She's not one to want attention,\" she said. \"She's a lovely young woman and it's tragic what has happened.\"Pamela Storro said that her son Travis met Storro at church in Priest River and had married shortly after. Six years later the couple divorced, a split that Pamela Storro said was amicable and was simply the product of marrying too young.  The couple did not have any children.She and Travis were still close, and he had visited her in the hospital as recently as last week, said Pamela Storro.Despite being left partially deaf after contracting meningitides when she was 2, Storro \u2013 whose friends refer to as \"Beese\" \u2013 was \"playful and funny,\" said Pamela Storro.\"It's insane to say anyone would ever make such an accusation,\" she said. \"It's such a complete stretch of anyone's imagination.\"Storro, with her entire face bandaged, spoke about the attack just hours after undergoing surgery for her acid-splattered face.\"Once [the acid] hit me I could actually hear it bubbling and sizzling my skin,\" she said. \"It was the most painful thing.\"\"A woman approached her and said, 'Hey pretty girl,' and she turned around and she asked if she wanted something to drink, and my daughter said, 'No,'\" Storro's mother, Nancy Neuwelt told reporters.Storro and her doctors have credited a pair of sunglasses that she purchased just moments before the attack for preventing blindness."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/social-climber-bruno-mars-crowned-artist-year-miley/story?id=21225040", "headline": "Bruno Mars Crowned Artist of the Year; China Reaches the Moon ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "December 15, 2013, 3:24 PM", "text": "Dec. 15, 2013 \u2014 -- quicklist:1title:  Bruno Mars Named Artist of the Yeartext: Better luck next year, Justin.Bruno Mars beat out flashier competitors like Miley Cyrus, Lady Gags and Justin Timberlake to win Billboard Magazine's coveted Artist of the Year award.Although his album sales for \"Unorthodox Jukebox\" came second to Timberlake's \"The 20/20 Experience,\" Mars was deemed biggest overall artist for the year with his number one hit, \"When I Was Your Man.\"media: 21124318quicklist: 2title:  Khaleesi Goes Terminatortext:But where are her dragons?Emilia Clarke has signed up to play Sarah Connor in the new Terminator remake.

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.  Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\u2014 John HancockNew Hampshire:Josiah Bartlett, William Whipple, Matthew ThorntonMassachusetts:John Hancock, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine, Elbridge GerryRhode Island:Stephen Hopkins, William ElleryConnecticut:Roger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, Oliver WolcottNew York:William Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, Lewis MorrisNew Jersey:Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, Abraham ClarkPennsylvania:Robert Morris, Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Franklin, John Morton, George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, James Wilson, George RossDelaware:Caesar Rodney, George Read, Thomas McKeanMaryland:Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, Charles Carroll of CarrolltonVirginia:George Wythe, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Harrison, Thomas Nelson, Jr., Francis Lightfoot Lee, Carter BraxtonNorth Carolina:William Hooper, Joseph Hewes, John PennSouth Carolina:Edward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., Thomas Lynch, Jr., Arthur MiddletonGeorgia:Button Gwinnett, Lyman Hall, George Walton"}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/santa-school-trains-st-nicks-beards-bad-breath/story?id=17897383", "headline": "Santa School Trains Would-Be St. Nicks in Beards, Bad Breath and ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "December 6, 2012, 10:09 PM", "text": "Dec. 7, 2012\u2014 -- On a chilly winter day in Midland, Mich., Fritz Schmidt walked into a hair salon to get his annual extreme makeover -- as Santa Claus. After a few hours of bleaching his hair and beard, Schmidt was a dead ringer for jolly old St. Nick.\"I first started when my daughter was born. She'll be 28 this year,\" said Schmidt, a 60-year-old semi-retired agricultural salesman.Schmidt said his transition to Santa was an enjoyable one because he loves children and this is one job where they are your main clients.\"You gotta have a good heart, and you have to believe yourself, because the kids can see through it if you're just there just for the sake of being there,\" Schmidt told \"20/20.\"That's just one of the many mantras Schmidt learned at Charles Howard Santa School in Midland.The Santa School was founded 75 years ago by former Macy's Santa Charles Howard and is the oldest Santa Claus Training Academy in the world, boasting more than 3,000 graduates.\"We have between 90 and 115 Santas attend every year and somewhere between eight to 20 of them are Mrs. Claus,\" said Holly Valent, who's been running the Santa School for 25 years with her husband, Tom.The school for mastering the spirit of Father Christmas is so popular that there is a waiting list every fall.\"I tried for five years to get into this school,\" said Rick Hyman, who's been a Santa since 1972. \"This without a doubt is the most exciting time that you'll ever experience in this life of being a Santa Claus.\"This Harvard of the Santa Schools, as it has been called, costs more than $400 and spans three days in October. The school offers instruction and fine tuning for returning students.\"They cover everything from bad breath to your beard and how to maintain your hair,\" said Schmidt. \"They teach sign language, too.\"The school brings in a trainer from the local gym to help Santas stay in good shape, a must for picking up hundreds of children per day, and the training is not complete without perfecting the all important \"ho ho ho.\"\"They even brought in an attorney whose primary emphasis was to make sure that you had both hands in every picture,\" said 64-year-old Ray Davis, a land surveyor who's been doing Santa for eight years.Yes, Santa needs liability insurance.\"You have to watch the way you handle the children,\" said Tom Valent, dean of the school. \"If you're gonna sit them on your knee, keep your hands exposed so people and the cameras can see them.\"Across the U.S. this holiday season at least 70,000 Santas are suiting up at malls, parades, company parties and other venues. These Santas are part of a growing number of office workers and retirees looking to make extra money to supplement their income.On average, many Santas can make between $20,000 to $50,000 during the holidays, and a few lucky ones rake in $80,000 or more. That's a good thing, because authentic Santa outfits can cost north of $2,000, and black boots are going for $400 these days.Aside from the attire and the lessons from the Santa School, most Santa students agree that the appearance of the hair and beard is key.Schmidt and Davis get theirs done at Sue Myers beauty shop in Midland.\"The beard needs to be a very soft white,\" said Myers, who has bleached and coiffed the curls of some of the finest Santas in the land for 15 years. \"The color has an illusion, and if you have dark hairs in there, it looks dry or wiry.\"Myers shared with \"20/20\" her biggest secret: peppermint oil.

Police are still investigating how she got to the farm stand. They will not comment on allegations that bullying prompted Isabella to run away until they talk to her.A person driving by a farm stand spotted a girl that looked like Isabella and called police at 10:46 a.m.\"The citizen reported seeing someone's head pop out of a hole in an abandoned farm stand,\" Gagne said.An officer was dispatched and found Isabella in the garage of the farm stand, three miles from her family's Orange, Conn., home. She had a bandana on her head.\"She was not aware there had been a search going on. She was in the farm stand the whole entire time,\" Gagne said. \"She was relieved. She was happy to be back with her family. She gave no indication of being scared.\"Isabella's father, Roman Oleschuk, spoke for the first time since his daughter disappeared.\"On behalf of my wife and family, we greatly appreciate all ofthe help in searching for my daughter Isabella... Isabella comes from a loving and supportive family that raised her with core Christian values\" Roman Oleschuk, Isabella's father, said. \"You took time away from your family to help ours.\"She had packed Pop Tarts and granola bars as well as a coat and blanket.  When approached by the police officer, she told the officer her name but was very quiet, police said.Church bells in the tiny town peeled to celebrate the good news.\"Our prayers have been answered,\" Annette Rubelman, a friend of the family, said through tears of joy.  \"We haven't been able to do anything.\"Connecticut police and the FBI knocked down doors, combed the woods with dogs and searched by air for the missing seventh grader.\"I'm so relieved. I know she will be showered with love when she walks in the door. If she had any doubt people cared about her, she won't after this,\" said Beth Rafferty, the leader of Isabella's youth group.Not Clear If Isabella Oleschuk Was a Victim of BullyingPolice are not certain why Isabella disappeared, but in the midst of their desperate search, police explored the possibility that the girl ran away to escape bullies.Local reporter Kathleen Schurman went to police after parents and kids contacted her saying that Bella as she was known was relentlessly made fun of for her quirks by classmates at Amity Regional Middle School.\"She had told several kids at school that she was going to run away because the bullying was so terrible and she was sure her parents were going to make her go back to school and she didn't want to,\" said Schurman, editor of online news site Bethwood Patch.Kids told Schurman that schoolmates called her \"duck girl\" because she likes to make quacking noises and animal sounds.Police issued a silver alert Sunday, which indicates that her disappearance is \"mysterious\" but not necessarily an abduction. Fliers being handed out throughout the town characterize the seventh-grader as an \"endangered runaway.\"The Orange, Conn., girl is partially deaf and normally uses a hearing aid. Her hearing aid was left behind, prompting concerns among rescuers that she might not be able to hear people calling her name.When ABC News reached Isabella's grandfather by phone Tuesday, he said that the family was \"anxiously awaiting her safe return.\"The girl's disappearance sparked an outpouring of support and help from the girl's hometown of less than 14,000 people.Police enlisted the help of the FBI, fire department and police cadets to assemble a team of 100 that has fanned throughout the town of less than 14,000 people.A prayer vigil was held Monday for Isabella by Orange Congregational Church, the church where the girl was baptized and her parents were married.\"We are part of a very close-knit community here,\" Orange resident Willie Ayala told WTNH.Ayala's daughter, Andriana, is one of Isabella's classmates.\"We've just been trying to keep hope, because we know we are going to find her,\" Andriana told WTNH.A candle was lit at the church each day Isabella was missing.ABC News' Emily Friedman contributed to this report.

Interior Secretary Gale Norton, also appearing on ABC's This Week, said the administration wanted to get the process out of the courts.\"Someone likened it to a hospital emergency room,\" Norton said. \"We're treating patients on the basis of their court docket. So, we're treating hangnails when we ought to be treating heart attacks.\"Environmental activists, however called the plan, an ?invitation to extinction.\"But some Clinton-era safeguards were announced by the administration last week, also, including protecting an additional 20,000 acres of wetlands.And Thursday, President Bush made his first Rose Garden remarks on the environment, announcing U.S. support for a treaty banning toxins such as DDT.\"Look, nobody's deaf, dumb, and blind over there, and everybody knows the environment is important,\" Christine Todd Whitman, EPA administrator said.  \"And we saw how things have been being portrayed.\"Brother Jeb Not HappyBut to the dismay of both environmentalists and President Bush's brother, Flordia Governor Jeb Bush, the administration announced plans to drill off the Gulf of Mexico.\"The proposal to drill in the Gulf of Mexico area is onethat has been on the table for quite a while, and is something thatwas approved by Congress,\" Norton said on This Week.. \"We do have to be aware of the need for energy to keep people in jobs and to ensure that our economy is a strong one.\"One long-time environmental activist expressed optimism about Bush's environmental policy future.\"Within a couple of days of Earth Day Richard Nixon recognizing that suddenly 20 million people, a lot of them Republicans, were out on the streets demonstrating for the environment proposed the creation of an Environmental Protection Agency,\" said Dennis Hayes, one of the organizers of the first Earth Day in 1970. \"And that was a Republican.\"ABCNEWS' Tim Sheld, ABCNEWS Radio and ABCNEWS.com's Rose Palazzolo contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92446&page=1", "headline": "More Missing, as Return to Normalcy Urged - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "January 7, 2006, 3:25 PM", "text": "Sept. 23, 2001 -- With hope of finding survivors growing dimmer and the number of missing growing, officials are telling New Yorkers to defy terror with a return to everyday business.\"The ultimate victory in this war is when everyone whowants to can do what everyone of us did today,\" Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said outside of a television show taping, \"and that is get up, let your children go to school, go out of the house and not in fear, stand here on a sidewalk and not worry about a truck bomb driving into us, and be able to be free in speech and thought and activity andbehavior.  And that's victory.\"Rumsfeld's remarks followed similar comments Saturday afternoon by former President Clinton and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, as officials delivered grim statistics about the missing and dead from the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. The number of missing was revised upward today from 6,333 people to 6,453 as officials removed duplicated names and added new names. As of Saturday, 261 people were confirmed dead, 194 of whom have been identified.Another 189 people are missing or dead at the Pentagon, also the site of a terrorist attack by a hijacked jetliner. An additional 44 people were killed when passengers apparently struggled with hijackers in another plane, which crashed in western Pennsylvania.Nevertheless, Giuliani told New Yorkers: \"You can go back to your normal way of life. And I think you honor the people who are missing and the people who died if you did that.  After all, they died to protect our normal way of life.\"Stop being afraid,\" he added. \"Stop being afraid doesn't mean that you can get rid of the emotion.  It means overcoming it.  Just going out and doing the things that you normally do.\"Return to Offices, HomesAs work continued at ground zero and passers-by looked on in a daze, many business owners and office workers waited in long lines this weekend to get police escorts into buildings nearby.John Horran, an attorney, said the stuff he had to leave behind is now desperately needed.\"We're trying to get our business back to normal,\" he said. \"So in order to go to court and make appearances we need our files back.\"Many allowed to enter for a few minutes said dust blankets everything in most offices with open or broken windows.  They say there's glass and paperwork scattered everywhere.On streets in the neighborhood, a fine water mist rained down on many streets as window washers worked to spray the area's buildings free of the grime that had collected on windows and facades for days.People who live in the area near the attack have been trying to go home, and Giuliani said a majority of people \u2014 5,000 to 6,000 of the 9,000 to 10,000 displaced \u2014 have returned.Red Cross shelters in the area that had been open since the attack were expected to close today. The Red Cross says it will still counsel people and assist as needed, but the demand for temporary housing dropped.  Volunteers said people were getting back into their apartments after nearly two weeks and no longer need a place to stay.Representatives of federal, state, city and volunteer agencies at the disaster site today said victims still in need of coordinated disaster assistance should contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1-800-462-9029, or 1-800-462-7585 for the hearing-impaired, said FEMA's Mike Byrne.\"The types of assistance programs that are available from FEMA at this time are things like temporary housing,\" Byrne said. \"If you've been put out of your home and you need temporary assistance, like a temporary hotel/motel accommodations, we will reimburse you for that.\"\u2018Total Devastation\u2019The general public is now allowed to get within just a couple of blocks of ground zero.  People stop and look in awe. Many climb onto benches or plaza planters to take pictures. The skeletal remains of the World Trade Center's South Tower loom above. Smoke still wafts from the stories-high pile of plaster, steel and concrete \u2014 with people buried underneath.\"Total devastation,\" said one onlooker as the weekend began. \"I mean \u2026 I've never seen anything like it.\"\"When you see all the pictures on TV and hear it on the radio, you think of seeing Bruce Willis walking out of it,\" said another. \"And then you're here and you know that it's reality, it's people's lives.\"\"We won't be able to find them, and you have to pay your respects somehow,\" another onlooker said.Children pointed, as their parents groped to explain what was in front of them.Today, thousands gathered at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx to pray for the missing and the dead at a special  service. Thousands of others were expected to gather at minor league stadiums in the area.James Earl Jones and Oprah Winfrey were emceeing the two-hour event, which began at 2:30 p.m. Singers such as Bette Midler, Placido Domingo and Lee Greenwood were performing, and religious leaders from various faiths spoke.Slim Hopes for SurvivorsBut Giuliani said officials haven't turned the corner and given up hope of finding someone alive.\"On the slim chance that there is anyone still alive, [recovery workers] are conducting the operation so they would be able to save someone if that were the case,\" Giuliani said. \"The mission is going to remain the same for some time. In other words, the firefighters and construction workers and police officers that are there are removing debris carefully in order to find human beings or human remains.\"Capt. Stewart Willig of a Florida task force working with New York rescuers at ground zero said Saturday it's still possible for people to survive in the levels below ground.\"The oxygen level is fine, so people can breathe down there,\" he said. \"The top floors we don't expect to find many survivors, but the lower floors that were pancaked down \u2026 we expect to find quite a few bodies and hopefully survivors down there.\"But some rescue workers said hope is finally fading.\"I think everybody's losing a little bit of spark, the hope that they're going to find somebody as time goes on is realistically \u2026  going to be a fluke, I feel,\" one worker said.ABCNEWS' Steffan Tubbs, Dorian Benkoil, Cheri Preston and Michael S.

Several Republicansstood to read or recite the Boy Scout oath.\"I have never been prouder in my entire political life than Iam to stand here today with Senator Jesse Helms and support thisamendment,\" said Sen.

The action came on a voicevote, a few hours after a 50-50 deadlock had appeared to have sentthe proposal down to defeat.At issue was an amendment by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., thatwould require schools and school districts to implement uniformdiscipline policies for all children, regardless of whether theyare disabled or receiving federal special educational funds.Sessions and other Republicans complained that in some cases,disabled students aren't punished as severely as others.\"If a child in a wheelchair sells dope, should they be treatedany differently than any other child who sells dope?\" he asked.    Democrats said the measure would strip valuable protections fromsome disabled students.\"We're not going to march backward,\" said Sen.

I just feel at one point in my life I had a calling, I was about 25 years old at the time -- maybe a little bit young now that I look back -- but I just think, I just wanted to be Santa.\"Valent remembers that first family he visited as Santa, wearing the bright red suit that his wife Holly had sewn by hand.\"I put on the suit that Holly had made for me and an inexpensive beard that we had purchased at the time, and I had done my visit and it made me feel good, and it made the family feel good.  They called back and thanked me for the work I had done and I was pretty pleased.\"But Valent was young, and thought he could be an even better Santa.  So he enrolled in a local Michigan Santa Claus school.  Yes, Santa has a school.  A three-day, 40-hour program that teaches you everything you need to know about the real Santa.\"I had to take three days off from work, and that wasn't normal for me to take any time off from work, and my wife Holly always questioned that.  And I still never missed school.\"In fact, Valent kept going to that school every year, for the next ten years -- not because he couldn't graduate, but because he really enjoyed being there.\"I just remember it being a very warm, friendly experience, so it was very small.  There was just myself and one other Santa there so there was two of us at this first school,\" says Valent.  \"It was back to childhood, back to the fantasy of the legend of Santa Claus and something that made me feel good and comfortable.\"So it might come as no surprise that Valent now runs the school, located right on Main Street in Midland, Mich.   It's not the North Pole, but nearly as cold.  And the school has grown over the years, from just two students on a couch to 100 students a year -- students who then go out and suit up across the country to prepare for their idol's arrival on Christmas Eve.    Classes being in mid-October, with many of the Santa's beginning their work in mid-November says Valent.  Many of the students are return Santas just like Valent was when he first started.The school provides a rigorous curriculum, teaching them everything from Santa's history to how to say \"Merry Christmas\" in sign language.\"You study the legends and you study the dress,\" says Valent.  \"Santa has to be perfect.  So, your dress has to be perfect.  You have the red and white suit.  The red stands for healthy outdoorsman, the white stands for purity.\"The school also teaches the Santas some practical lessons, including how to stay healthy despite Santa's jolly figure and love of milk and cookies.\"We do try to teach the Santas that eating healthy is important.  If you stay healthy, you're more alert, you're more up and you can have that conversation,\" says Valent.   \"[It's] not really fair to the children if that Santa can't participate in a good conversation and be up, happy, and jolly that whole time.  Children remember the conversation and the visit for a long time.\"Another key lesson:  How to prepare for the many of questions they are sure to get from all the children they meet.\"They're going to ask a lot of questions about the North Pole.  They want to know 'how old is Rudolph?'  Rudolph is 71 years old this year.  He was born in 1939.  They'll want to know how many elves you have.  I always tell them I have 886 elves \u2026 I don't know where I got that number but that's what I've been telling them for 35 years and it works,\" says Valent.And perhaps, most importantly, \"Never think you are the real Santa,\" says Valent.  \"It's a privilege, not a job.\""}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/ultimate-undercover-boss-nm-secretary-corrections-secretly-spends/story?id=24166101", "headline": "Ultimate Undercover Boss: N.M. Secretary of Corrections Secretly ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "June 16, 2014, 10:10 PM", "text": "June 19, 2014\u2014 -- When Prisoner 106 arrived at the maximum security facility of Level Six in the New Mexico State Penitentiary in Santa Fe, he was on the books as a dangerous armed robber headed straight for solitary confinement.But as he was moved into his 12-foot-by-7-foot cell, where he would have little to no physical contact with the outside world, the thing that almost no one at the prison knew was that this inmate was actually the Secretary of Corrections for the state of New Mexico.Gregg Marcantel is a former cop who spent a career putting away criminals, and he decided to put himself in solitary in Level Six to live among the worst of the worst inmates.\u201cThis is where our predators, our monsters, are dangerous inmates are housed,\u201d said Alex Tomlin, the public affairs director for New Mexico's Department of Corrections. \u201cMy greatest fear is that something happens to [Marcantel].\u201d\u201c[Even] 24 hours in a maximum security prison is still a lot of time,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe next 48 hours will really just be about waiting and praying.\u201dThere are an estimated 80,000 inmates locked up in solitary confinement in the United States, but this form of incarceration has become extremely controversial. Not only is it three times as expensive to house an inmate in solitary, but critics say it can also make inmates more dangerous.Marcantel said he was doing this because he wants to reform the state's use of solitary. He said most of the inmates who are placed in solitary confinement will end up back on the streets, transformed into super criminals.\u201cWe are sending them back to our neighborhoods worse than when they came... I can\u2019t allow that,\u201d he said.But before he made any changes, Marcantel wanted to experience solitary from the inside, so he spent 48 hours living in lockdown in Level Six.Level Six is divided up into three separate housing units, holding a total of 282 inmates, who are doing time for crimes that range from rape to armed robbery to murder. Combined, the men here have killed 138 people.Once in his cell, Marcantel sorted through his prison-issued personal effects and opened a letter from his wife.\u201cThe whole time we\u2019ve ever been together, there\u2019s never been a day that we didn\u2019t speak to one another,\u201d he said.Very quickly, the inmates started to buzz about the latest arrival, yelling \u201chey, new guy\u201d and \u201cCell 6, who the [expletive] are you?\u201d Correction officers told the inmates that Prisoner 106 was speech and hearing impaired because the secretary worried that if the inmates hear his distinctive voice, his cover will be blown and his security compromised.As the hours rolled by, the secretary started to realize that the greatest danger wasn\u2019t from other inmates, but from his own mind.Several inmates told \u201cNightline\u201d the only way to mentally survive in solitary confinement, which they sometimes referred to as \u201csegregation\u201d or simply \u201cseg,\u201d is to have a routine.\u201cI exercise. I read a lot. If I didn\u2019t have books I probably would have already gone insane,\u201d said Freddy Munoz, who was one housing unit over from Marcantel.Growing up, Munoz, 34, said he wanted to be an astronaut, but at age 13 he got caught up in gangs and committed two murders.  Prison officials have kept him in a cell in solitary confinement every day for years because of his violent past and gang affiliations. He knows every crack and every inch of peeling paint in his cell.\u201cIt is perpetual misery,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cIt's ennui. It's monotony. It's repetition.\u201dOn the other side of Level Six was Daniel Herrera, who was also placed in solitary because he has been a gang member. He is 23 years old and serving a sentence for kidnapping.Herrera showed how he and other inmates \u201cgo fishing\u201d by pulling and throwing a wire to get things from one cell to the next, \u201cwithout getting caught,\u201d he said, although the correction officers said they were well aware of the fishing phenomenon. If they are caught, Herrera said inmates can lose privileges like rec time.\u201cYou\u2019ve got 23 hours a day locked down, you got a lot of time to come up with,\u201d Herrera said.After six hours in solitary, Marcantel was served his first meal: a meat patty, baked beans, wheat bread and cauliflower. After nine hours, he brushed his teeth and got ready for a long night. The next morning, he was served plain pancakes.\u201cI\u2019ve developed what I call an \u2018inmate clock,\u2019\u201d Marcantel said. \u201cI would touch the window and if it were cool and light, I knew it was morning\u2026 if it was warm, I knew it was afternoon.\u201dWhen collecting food trays, the corrections officers did a check to make sure no one broke off a piece of plastic that could be used to create a weapon.\u201cIt takes a certain kind of person [to do this job],\u201d said one officer. \u201cWe\u2019re working inside the lion\u2019s cage with the lion.\u201dTo keep themselves safe, the officers follow rigid protocols. For example, they strip search inmates for weapons or contraband any time they take one out to the yard, which is known as the \u201crec pen.\u201dTwenty-four hours into Marcantel\u2019s stay, claustrophobia started setting in.\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little nauseated and I\u2019m standing at the door now and I\u2019m looking outside and I\u2019m realizing that I can\u2019t get on the other side of the door,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like the cell was kind of squeezing down on me.\"Critics of solitary confinement call it legalized torture. They say studies show it can result in brain damage similar to that made by head trauma. Humans are social animals and we are built for interaction. Take that away, and critics say inmates can literally lose their minds.But many corrections officials say solitary confinement is a necessary tool to control a dangerous prison population. Officers at the New Mexico prison point to inmate Nathaniel Stein as an example. Stein was placed in solitary after he viciously attacked a corrections officer a few months ago.\u201cI don\u2019t really feel bad for the things I\u2019ve done,\u201d Stein said.On the flipside, there are inmates in solitary like Freddy Munoz, who has been a model inmate, despite the severity of his crimes. Munoz was one of a select few handpicked inmates to get out of solitary and into the general population of the prison as part of Secretary Marcantel\u2019s plan -- the restoration into population program -- to reduce the number of inmates in solitary.\u201cTo be able to walk around a little bit more... to be able to go outside without having to be handcuffed and restrained every day, I think it would be very good for me,\u201d Munoz said.When Marcantel was released, the first thing he reached for was a large cup of coffee.\u201cNot sure I want to do it again, but I am really glad I did it,\u201d he said.After spending 48 hours on the inside, the secretary said he believes that soliatry should continue to be used but only sparingly, for the most dangerous inmates.\u201cThere is such a thing as evil,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not whether or not they are going to hurt people\u2014they started hurting people when they were four years old -- and it\u2019s up to me to make sure that not only am I protecting other inmates from them, but I am also protecting my staff from them.\u201dSure enough, a few days after Marcantel release, Munoz, Daniel Herrera and six other inmates were brought out of Level Six solitary and into an intermediate level, in preparation for an eventual return to the general prison population.\u201cThis is living, right here, finally,\u201d Munoz said.For the first time in years, they will actually be able to sit next to one another and have real human contact. These men are part of an experiment and part of a trend as New Mexico and the country takes its first steps away from the costly and controversial form of punishment."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=95623&page=1", "headline": "Cheney Defends Bush In a \"Major\" Way - ABC News", "source": "ABC News", "date": "January 7, 2006, 2:48 PM", "text": "\u2014 -- Dick Cheney is still defending George W.

Or, the alternative would be for the trust to divest itself of its holdings in Occidental Petroleum to resolve any conflict of interest,\u201d Cheney said Monday after a visit to the Eagle Tool and Machine company in Springfield, Ohio.After being chosen as Bush\u2019s running mate on the Republican ticket, Cheney only reluctantly parted with shares in the Dallas-based Halliburton Co., the world\u2019s biggest energy-services company, which Cheney headed until being tapped for the Republican ticket.\u201cThe end of June, he [Gore] advocated the extension of a moratorium on paying royalties by companies drilling in the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d said Cheney. \u201cAt the time that he did this, it was clear that perhaps the biggest beneficiary of that proposed extension of the moratorium was Occidental Petroleum.\u201dWhen asked if he was merely striking back because the Democrats have been accusing him of a conflict of interest for his positions on increased domestic oil production, Cheney said, \u201cI\u2019ve severed my ties with Halliburton.

Bush\u2019s struggles with the English language continued Monday, albeit in a lower key than on some past occasions.Asked at a town hall meeting in Portland, Ore., whether he would forfeit U.S. sovereignty to the United Nations, if elected President, Bush promised he would not, explaining, \u201cI view the U.N. as an opportunity for people to vent.\u201dAfter some rumblings of laughter, Bush explained, \u201cI say that not facetiously. I mean it\u2019s a chance for the world to come together and discuss and to dialogue.\u201d He added that the United Nations can occasionally be useful for humanitarian and peacekeeping purposes.Later, asked about the environment, Bush noted that landowners are the ones who are \u201cmaking sure that land is pristine and functionable.\u201dBush seems to have adopted the habit of adding the suffix \u201c-able\u201d to words instead of \u201c-al.\u201d Earlier this month, he denied that a pro-Bush TV ad contained a \u201csubliminable\u201d message.And at a later event in Spokane, Wash., Bush seemed to inadvertently grant statehood to the District of Columbia.

The single mom and her son, James \"Trey\" Rawlins III, searched everywhere \u2013 from local booksellers to online retailers \u2013 for reading materials that could help them better understand the journey they were about to embark on together. When they ended up with nothing,Trey decided to write a book himself.Five years later, Trey, now age nine and a fourth-grader at Edgewood Magnet School in New Haven, Conn., is a published author, with help from a $1,000 donation from Howard University Hospital, in Washington, D.C., and his mom's credit  cards. \"When Mommy Came Home\" is targeted toward children ages four to seven. By word-of-mouth the book, available for $10 through his mother, became so popular among local schools, clinics and hospitals that it is now sold out. The mother-son team hopes that with donations, they will be able to order more books that can be distributed to the people and places that may need them most.In his book Trey writes how his mom \"would see Nurse Karen for her treatments \u2026 she'd sit in a big comfy chair \u2026 eat treats and snacks and sometimes do her nails.\" Although he wasn't able to accompany his mom around the hospital, \"I waited until she came home\" and the two would nap on the couch. Trey recounts helping his mom by doing \"little jobs\" like dusting or emptying out the trash. The book contains over 20 illustrations from Jean Marie Sanchez of Hamden, a children's book writer and illustrator.Having only ordered 100 initial copies, Marion-Rawlins said she did not expect the book to garner all the attention it has. Hospitals and clinics as far as Augusta, Ga., are now requesting copies. Although she admitted to \"maxing out my credit card\" to finance the book, Marion-Rawlins hopes that the book will get picked up by more publishing outlets.\"We're not looking to make a profit,\" Marion-Rawlins, currently an education consultant for the State Education Resource Center in Connecticut, said. \"We want to donate them to hospitals, so when other moms are diagnosed, now they'll have a tool that I didn't have. So if they have a young child, they'll know what to expect.\"Marion-Rawlins, whose son was in school when ABC News spoke with her, said both she and her son have had an amazing journey. Neither expected the outcome \"to be so big.\"Although she is now happy to report, \"I'm doing great,\" Marion-Rawlins was diagnosed back in 2007. The former first-grade teacher said the first thing she asked the hospital social workers for was a children's book.\"She came back with really technical medical pamphlets and I thought to myself, 'No, this isn't going to do it,'\" Marion-Rawlins said. \"I figured that if I could just show him in a book with pictures what Mommy was going to go through and that we're going to be O.K., then it would be O.K.\"In \"When Mommy Came Home,\" the \"adventures\" between mother and son during the treatment help drive the book forward and show readers that the little moments are what helped them get through the ordeal.\"He had always wanted to wear a [beanie] that he saw his older cousins wearing, so when I lost my hair, we wore matching ones,\" she said.When her taste buds changed, Marion-Rawlins recommended her son \"eat everything Mommy can't eat anymore,\" and after her treatment, when her body ached so much she couldn't walk to her bedroom upstairs, she and Trey pretended to be in the wilderness and \"camped out\" in their living room.But Marion-Rawlins said although the book is a team effort, her son really takes the spotlight for his proactive attitude that was initially triggered when more and more families began to share their stories, asking Trey to talk to other children about his experience. When the mother of Trey's friends across the street was diagnosed with breast cancer last year, Trey was more than willing to talk to them about what he was going through.Karen Underwood, aka Nurse Karen, told ABC News that she was \"speechless\" when she learned she was a character in the book. Underwood's role was to administer Marion-Rawlins' chemotherapy and \"assess and take care of her.\"\"I think this will definitely have a positive impact on children,\" said Underwood, a registered nurse at Yale New Haven. \"That population goes through a lot of stuff and many parents wonder what's going to happen to their children.\"Trey's main focus during this time was \"being brave,\" and Marion-Rawlins said she is \"blown away\" by her son's care and compassion. The young author has been asked to speak to other children and parents in the community and Marion-Rawlins said instead of getting nervous like most other kids his age, he doesn't shy away because he \"knows it's going to help other moms and children.\"Jennifer Quirk, library media specialist at Trey's school, said although they do have children's literature on breast cancer and other diseases, many of the material is non-fiction and \"doesn't talk about real people going through the experience.\"  Quirk said this will be the first book in the school's library that chronicles a personal experience.\"It's always a taboo subject, so having literature like this will help to make it something that parents can talk about with their kids,\" Quirk said.Andrea Seigerman, LCSW, of the Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New-Haven, said there is still a great need for materials for \"children of all ethnic groups and of all educational levels.\" Seigerman worked closely with Marion-Rawlins as her social worker during her treatment at Yale.\"There is a real need for easily understandable, easily communicated information from parents - both mothers and fathers going through cancer treatment \u2013 to children,\" Seigerman, who was with Marion-Rawlins since day one, said. \"It touches on a universal need \u2013 the idea that a little boy or girl can look at a book and feel that they're not the only one who's going through this.\"\"Parents want to protect and inform them, but many aren't sure how to do that,\" Seigerman said. \"So the most important outcome of this book is that it will help other parents feel comfortable opening up about this topic with their children.\"But the mother-and-son duo's journey doesn't end here. Marion-Rawlins, who has a niece who wears a cochlear implant because of a hearing impairment, said they are currently discussing the possibilities of writing a second book about her to \"provide awareness regarding that community.\"\"[Trey] knows what it feels like to be different,\" Marion-Rawlins said. \"I think it's so important to share with children what's going on at a level they can understand.\""}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/dunwoody-day-care-trial-widow-didnt-tear-eye/story?id=15783446", "headline": "Dunwoody Day Care Trial: Widow 'Didn't Have a Tear in Her Eye ...", "source": "ABC News", "date": "February 24, 2012, 4:02 PM", "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 24, 2012 \u2014 -- A witness in the trial of a Georgia man accused of killing the husband of his alleged lover testified today that the woman's reaction to her husband's death was \"unusual, to say the least.\"Hemy Neuman, 49, is charged with shooting and killing Andrea Sneiderman's husband, Rusty Sneiderman, 36, in the parking lot of the Sneidermans' son's preschool in November 2010.Neuman, Andrea Sneiderman's former boss at GE Energy, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.A husband and wife who witnessed the shooting in the parking lot of a Dunwoody day care testified about the chaotic scene, including Andrea Sneiderman's arrival at the facility.\"She sped in so fast, swung the door open and was screaming, 'What happened?'\" Aliyah Stotter testified today. \"Afterwards, I told my husband, 'She didn't have a tear in her eye.'\"When prosecutor Don Geary asked Stotter if she thought Sneiderman's reaction was unusual, Stotter replied, \"Yes, I mean, I was crying.\"Stotter's husband, Dr. Craig Kuhlmeier, was pulling into a nearby post office when he heard gun shots. He told his wife he thought someone had been shot and saw someone, now believed to be Neuman, \"casually walking back to his vehicle.\"\"When I went up to the victim, he was bleeding out,\" Kuhlmeier testified today.Stotter said, \"His eyes were still open and he was gasping for air. There was quite a lot of blood everywhere. He was laying on a slant, so you saw blood running from the school towards the pediatrician's office.\"Andrea Sneiderman testified earlier this week that no one at the day care would tell her what happened to her husband and she did not know he had been shot and killed until she went to the hospital.\"I pulled up my vehicle to caution tape, police cars and Rusty's car,\" Sneiderman told the court. \"I fell out of the vehicle and was picked up and taken inside.\"An Atlanta Medical Center doctor, Dr. Mark Waterman, who was part of the team that attempted to resuscitate Rusty Sneiderman, today described his encounter with Andrea Sneiderman after revival attempts failed and her husband was pronounced dead.\"Not emotional, not crying, screaming, or wanting to know what happened,\" Waterman testified of Andrea Sneiderman. \"Her first request was for a child psychologist.\"Waterman said she wanted a psychologist to \"inform her children of his passing.\" He described the reaction as \"unusual, to say the least.\"When the attorney asked Waterman if he had ever had someone ask for a child psychiatrist before, Waterman said, \"No, never had that question before. And I'm used to talking to people whose family members have expired all the time.\"Prosecutors have yet to say where they are headed with their line of questioning that has returned to Andrea Sneiderman several times.Earlier today, Sneiderman was barred from the courthouse for the duration of the trial after an inappropriate interaction with a witness.Prosecutor Geary asked the Atlanta court for Andrea Sneiderman to be removed from the courtroom and courthouse for the duration of the trial.\"She hugged and kissed a witness in front of the jury,\" Geary said. \"The investigator told her [Sneiderman] not to, she pushed him [the investigator] away.\"The witness was Sneiderman's close friend of 10 years, Shayna Citron, who testified Thursday. Citron's testimony cast doubt on Sneiderman's statement to the court, in which she said she did not know her husband had been shot and killed until 11 a.m., when she arrived at the hospital.Citron testified that she received a call from Sneiderman telling her what happened at 10:30 a.m., which would mean that Sneiderman knew about her husband's death earlier than she claimed.\"[Andrea Sneiderman] then went in the hallway and told the witness that since she didn't believe her, that she wasn't her friend anymore,\" Geary said. \"The display in the courtroom was all for show.\"Geary said that Sneiderman then went into the state's witness room after being told not to do so. He said witnesses from GE asked him that Sneiderman not be in the courtroom for their testimony.\"She is making statements during court in the gallery, and I hear her -- and I'm hard of hearing --- saying, 'That's not true,' 'That's a lie,' 'You weren't there,'\" Geary said. \"I've been tempted to turn and snap and tell her to shut up, but that wouldn't be appropriate.\"Sneiderman has been reacting vocally and physically throughout the trial, letting out sobs and shaking her head during opening statements earlier this week.\"She's not following our instructions, she's not following the court's instructions,\" the prosecutor said. \"Everyone has too much going here to have for, for her own purpose, have a mistrial. Our purpose is to convict the man who shot Rusty. I don't want a mistrial.\"Geary asked the judge for two things: that Sneiderman be removed from the courthouse and that she be reinstructed that if she contacts any witnesses, there will be consequences.When Neuman's defense attorney, Bob Rubin, was given the opportunity to weigh in, he said, \"What Mr. Geary has laid out is sufficient reason to bar her from the courtroom. We would bar her.\"Judge Gregory Adams listened to both sides and agreed to remove Sneiderman \"so that I can conduct this trial in a fair and just matter,\" he said.\"She should be removed and should not have any contact, directly or indirectly, with any witness in this matter,\" Adams said. \"Do not communicate on any level whatsoever.\"In addition to Citron, Andrea Sneiderman's father-in-law, Don Sneiderman, testified that she knew about her husband's death earlier than she claims.Rusty Sneiderman's father told the court that he received a phone call on the day of the incident from Andrea Sneiderman at 9:30 a.m. saying that his son had been shot.That account conflicted with Andrea Sneiderman's testimony Wednesday, when she told the court that she first heard that her husband was shot when she arrived at the hospital at 11 a.m.\"I didn't know what happened to Rusty until I got to the emergency room,\" Sneiderman, who has denied that she had an affair with Neuman and has not been charged in connection with her husband's death, said Wednesday. \"No one told me what happened to Rusty,\" she said.Neither the defense nor the prosecution denies that Neuman pulled the trigger and killed Sneiderman, but they tell divergent stories of what led to the killing.The prosecution painted Neuman as a calculating killer who planned Sneiderman's shooting for months, going to gun shows, taking a gun safety course, going to target practice, renting a car for the shooting and wearing a disguise.Neuman's attorney, Doug Peters, said in his opening statements that Neuman believed he had been visited by an angel resembling Olivia Newton-John and a demon resembling Barry White, who told him that Sneiderman's children were his and that he needed to protect them by killing Rusty Sneiderman.Neuman's defense claims he and Andrea Sneiderman were involved in a hot-and-cold affair when she worked for him at General Electric.In her testimony, Sneiderman called Neuman \"a self-proclaimed delusional individual\" who fooled her using \"masterful manipulation.\"Although she had suspicions about Neuman, she told the court it was \"unfathomable\" to her that he had really killed her husband until he was arrested.\"I couldn't believe it,\" she said. \"I thought I was crazy. Whose boss kills someone's husband? Affair or no affair -- and there wasn't -- who kills someone else's husband?\"Additional reporting by Heather Whitley.

I cannot communicate with people.\"Limbaugh did not disclose the cause of his ailment, saying the doctors have their own theories and he preferred to keep them to himself.Such rapid deterioration is \"relatively rare,\" said Dr. Bevan Yueh of the University of Washington.Yueh would not speculate on a possible diagnosis without having examined Limbaugh or his test results, but added, \"A complete loss that he describes experiencing usually carries a poor prognosis for regaining hearing.\"The Show Will Go OnThe flamboyant talk show host began mouthing off on the air 14 years ago after noticing the lack of a conservative voice on the air. His program emerged as political correctness and liberal ideals gained increasing attention in mainstream media, with Limbaugh serving as the foil to their comments.Listeners increasingly turned their dial to hear Limbaugh's opinions. While some criticized Limbaugh for his barking manner and harsh attitude toward liberals and feminists \u2014 whom he ridiculed as \"feminazis\" \u2014 he offered a rallying cry for those who share his values.The Rush Limbaugh Show became one of the most popular shows on the air through the 1990s. He also published two books, The Way Things Ought to Be and See, I Told You So.His outspoken opinions also made him the butt of liberals' jokes and prompted books such as Al Franken's Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot.Limbaugh told his fans he expects to be completely deaf in a month, but will continue his program regardless of his health condition.  Just a few months ago he renewed his contract through 2009 with Premiere Radio Networks.  The deal was reported to be worth $285 million \u2014 the priciest radio contract in history.His call-in show and 90-second radio commentary reach roughly 20 million listeners, according to The Associated Press.It's not clear how he will fulfill his contract, since he can't hear phone calls, but he insisted the show will go on.\"I'm not going to explain to you how we're doing this,\" said Limbaugh.  \"Put two and two together, if you wish, but as long as the passion exists to do it, then we'll find a way.\"ABCNEWS.com's Nancy Chandross and the ABCNEWS medical unit contributed to this report."}]
